10744262,"We discovered that Nε-lysine acetylation occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in 2007.
From that initial finding, we went on to discover the entire ER acetylation machinery (one membrane
transporter, AT-1/SLC33A1, and two acetyltranferases, ATase1 and ATase2) and uncover a novel piece of
ER biology. Specifically, we discovered that the ER acetylation machinery regulates proteostasis within the ER
and secretory pathway by maintaining the balance between quality control/engagement of the secretory
pathway and reticulophagy. By using a combination of biochemistry and high-definition mass spectrometry, we
discovered that SLC25A1 and SLC13A5 act as important “metabolic partners” of AT-1.
 Homozygous mutations in AT-1/SLC33A1, SLC25A1 or SLC13A5 are associated with developmental delay
of the brain and early forms of encephalopathy while heterozygous mutations are associated with similar forms
of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), including specific forms of spastic paraplegias.
Important, these mutations either introduce a premature STOP codon or cause loss-of-function of the
transporters. Furthermore, gene duplication events of AT-1/SLC33A1, SLC25A1 or SLC13A5 are associated
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and progeria-like dysmorphism. To expand our
studies, we generated neuron-specific (AT-1 nTg, SLC25A1 nTg, and SLC13A5 nTg) and systemic (AT-1 sTg,
SLC25A1 sTg, and SLC13A5 sTg) overexpressing mice. These animals display important phenotypic
similarities, supporting the conclusion that we have identified a unified metabolic pathway that is at the basis of
closely related neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases across lifespan. To complement the
above studies and dissect the specific role of the two ATases, down-stream of AT-1, we have also generated
Atase1-/- and Atase2-/- mice. Their phenotype supports the idea that these two ER-based acetyltransferases
have evolved to play partially divergent roles. The GENERAL HYPOTHESIS of this research is that SLC25A1,
SLC13A5, and AT-1 act in concert to regulate engagement of the secretory pathway and induction of
reticulophagy. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the ER acetylation machinery is the downstream
target of a dysfunctional cytosol-to-ER flux of acetyl-CoA caused by the duplication of AT-1, SLC25A1 or
SLC13A5. Specific Aim 2 will use our newly generated Atase1-/- and Atase2-/- mice to test the hypothesis that
ATase1 and ATase2 have partially different biological functions. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
specific structural features of newly identified AT-1 downstream targets allow fine tuning of reticulophagy. In
conclusion, this proposal is the result of novel discoveries made in our laboratory; it will help us dissect the
molecular mechanisms of severe neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases across lifespan and it
will allow us dissect essential molecular and biochemical functions of the ER that will impact other areas of
biomedical research."
10759389,"With more than 13% of adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorders each year, prevention of depressive
disorders has become a key priority for the NIMH. Unfortunately, we have no widely available interventions to
reduce morbidity and mortality (e.g. public health impact). To address this need, we developed a multi-health
system “collaboratory” to develop and evaluate the primary care based-technology “behavioral vaccine,”
Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive-Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Therapy (CATCH-IT)
(14 adolescent, 4 parent modules). Using this health-system collaboratory model, CATCH-IT demonstrated
evidence of efficacy in prevention of depressive episodes in phase-three clinical trials in the United States and
China. However, like many “package” interventions, CATCH-IT became larger and more complex across efficacy
trials. Thus, adolescents and parents were less willing to complete all 18 modules, suggesting adolescent dose
“tolerability” issues (e.g. satisfaction, acceptability and resource use, “time as cost”). Similarly, primary care
practices have “scalability” challenges (acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost), resulting in declining
REACH (percent of at-risk youth who complete intervention). To prepare for implementation studies and
dissemination, we need to address adolescent tolerability and practice/health system scalability, while preserving
efficacy. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses a systematic analytic approach and a factorial
randomized clinical trial design to address efficacy, tolerability, and scalability, simultaneously. We will use a
MOST approach to optimize CATCH-IT for the prevention of depression (indicated prevention, i.e., elevated
symptoms of depression) in practices and health systems representative of US geography and population. The
theoretically grounded components of CATCH-IT selected for study and optimization are: behavioral activation,
cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and parent program. We will use a 4-factor (2x2x2x2) fully
crossed factorial design with N=16 cells (20 per cell, 15% dropout) to evaluate the contribution of each
component. We propose to randomize N=378 (N=189) from each health system site. The at-risk youth will be
high school students 13 through 18 years old, not currently experiencing a mood disorder, but with subsyndromal
symptoms of depression (moderate to high risk). Using the efficient factorial design, we can assess the
contribution to prevention efficacy of each component. Thus, the MOST study design will enable us to eliminate
non-contributing components while preserving efficacy and to optimize CATCH-IT by strengthening tolerability
and scalability by reducing “resource use.” By reducing resource use, we anticipate satisfaction and acceptability
will also increase, preparing the way for an implementation trial and eventual US Preventive Services Task Force
endorsement to support dissemination. Thus, our primary question is whether one component, or perhaps
two, can demonstrate an equivalent effect to combinations of other components in terms of efficacy, whilst also
demonstrating superior adolescent/family tolerability scalability over a 12-month follow-up."
10686314,"Among US adolescents, suicide is the second leading cause of death1. Suicide risk is not uniform across youth,
and those involved in the juvenile justice (JJ) system are at even greater risk for suicidal behavior (SB) given
their increased prevalence of mood and substance use disorders, trauma exposure, and access to firearms.
While SB screening and service provision for youth in secure JJ settings occurs more systematically, such
practices are rarer for youth who are supervised in their community (i.e., probation settings). The proposed study
will examine strategies to bolster the successful scale-up of e-Connect, one of the few evidence-based suicide
behavior identification and cross-system linkage programs for youth on under community supervision. This
proposal is from two PIs with complimentary expertise in the justice system, implementation science, clinical
decision support systems, and use of large administrative data sets, and is supported by a strong multi-
disciplinary team to achieve study aims. Guided by the Gateway Provider Model (GPM) and the Exploration,
Preparation, Implementation Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework, we now propose to extend ourwork
of e-Connect, to develop and test a “purveyor model” of implementation scale-up (i.e., e-Connect-scaleup). In e-
Connect-scaleup, researchteamleadershipwill serveas External Facilitatorsto support Local Facilitators to ensure
the successful transfer of knowledge, skill and expertise in delivering e-Connect in a new JJ system and
geographic context, utilizing implementation strategies to support the more widespread, sustained and rigorous
adoption of e-Connect. Working in 9 Indiana counties, randomly assigned to one of three waves in a stepped-
wedge, implementation-effectivenesshybrid type-2 design
,the specificaims are to
examine the clinical and cost-
effectiveness of e-Connect-scaleup on (i) identification of youth service need (SB and BH correlates) in juvenile
probationers; (ii) cross-system (probation-BH agency) referral; and (iii) youth BH service use (initial BH contact;
primary outcome) by comparing the performance of e-Connect to (a) standard probation officer practice
(baseline) and (b) to rates achieved in the prior efficacy trial of e-Connect (Aim 1). We will examine potential
mediating or moderating effects of EPIS/GPM inner and outer context factors. We will also determine whether
e-Connect-scaleup can reduce race or gender health disparities in SB/BH service need identification, cross-
system referral and youth SB/BH service use (e.g. as compared to standard probation practice (baseline), which
would replicate the disparity-reducing performance of e-Connect in NYS (Aim 2). Finally, we will examine the
implementation of e-Connect-scaleup in terms of fidelity and acceptability and compare advancement through
the stages of implementation through to sustainment across the 9 counties in order to demonstrate the feasibility
of scaling-up e-Connect in probation settings beyond NYS (Aim 3). We will elucidate the inner- and outer-level
EPIS- and GPM- derived factors that promote or hinder delivery of implementation strategies and practice
change to inform scale up across a variety of contexts."
10922841,"OVERALL - ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the
United States, with the overhwhelming majority of patients presenting advanced stage disease. Invasive
neoplasia in the pancreas represents the culmination of a multistep progression that begins with non-invasive
precursor lesions, which remain an untapped “window of opportunity” for early detection and cancer interception.
Two major histological subtypes of precursor lesions are recognized - the more common non-cystic pathway,
represented by pancreatic intarepithelial neoplasia or PanIN lesions, estimated to precede ~90% of PDAC, and
the cystic pathway, most commonly represented by intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or IPMNs,
accounting for the remaining 10%. While members of this team have played a seminal role in characterizing the
histology and genetics of PanINs and IPMNs, much remains to be elucidated in terms of the molecular
dependencies that sustain early pancreatic neoplasia, and how signaling cues from these early lesions
reprogram the “precursor microenvironment” (PME), including “precursor-associated fibroblasts” (PAFs). The
goal of our Tri-state Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma TBEL (Tri-PACT) Center - incorporating UT MD Anderson
Cancer Center (UTMDACC), University of Michigan (UMich) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) - is to create
a collaborative and integrated U54 center to conduct basic and translational studies in early pancreatic neoplasia.
The Tri-PACT Center will be led by Dr. Anirban Maitra (UTMDACC) and Co-PI Dr. Marina Pasca di Magliano
(UMich). The title of our Tri-PACT Center proposal is “Tumor Microenvironment Crosstalk Drives Early Lesions
in Pancreatic Cancer”, and we are proposing three projects (two basic, one translational), each of which will be
supported by a Multiscale Computational Oncology Research Core (M-CORE) and an Administrative Core (AC).
Project 1 (basic) will study the functional requirement of a pivotal cytokine, interleukin IL-33, which is induced in
the PAF and epithelial compartments of PanINs and IPMNs in response to KRAS and GNAS mutations,
respectively, in disease progression and reprogramming of the PME. Project 2 (basic) will study a unique
metabolic “synthetic essentiality” centered on mitochondrial quality control created in cystic precursors that
harbor loss of RNF43, a E3 ubiquitin ligase lost in ~50% of IPMNs. Notably, the Tri-PACT investigators have
developed genetically engineered models (GEMs) of pancreatic preneoplasia that recapitulate the cognate
human lesions, and will be extensively leveraged in the two basic projects, with cross-species validation in
patient-derived preclinical models. Project 3 (translational) will deploy a unique 3D reconstruction tool (CODA)
paired with multi-region sequencing of human precursor lesions to map the evolutionary trajectory of individual
precursors at an unprecedented resolution, and correlate subclonal architecture with high dimensional analysis
of the immune and PAF composition within the PME. Cumulatively, these projects will enhance our
understanding of the drivers of early pancreatic neoplasia, and a seedbed for early detection approaches."

 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include primary myelofibrosis (PMF; characterized by the over-
proliferation of megakaryocytes and granulocytes with abnormal collagen deposition in the bone marrow stroma),
essential thrombocythemia (ET; increased megakaryocyte and platelet production), and polycythemia vera (PV;
increased red cell production, hemoglobin, and hematocrit). Although all MPN driver mutations lead to
constitutive activation of JAK/STAT signaling, targeted JAK inhibitors are not curative and fail to alter disease
progression. Therefore, there is a great unmet need to identify novel curative therapies for MPNs. Mutations in
calreticulin (CALR) represent the second most common genetic abnormality in MPN. The CALR gene encodes
a calcium (Ca2+)-binding chaperone protein that primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All CALR
mutations share an identical neomorphic C-terminal peptide, which permits binding to the thrombopoietin
receptor MPL and the subsequent activation of pathogenic JAK/STAT signaling. The majority of CALR mutations
are classified as either type 1 or type 2 based on the extent of homology to the wild type protein, where type 1
proteins exhibit complete loss of C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites that are retained in type 2. Despite their shared
mutant C-terminus and ability to bind and activate MPL, type 1 and 2 CALR mutations engender significant
phenotypic and prognostic differences. Type 1 mutations are more common in PMF, and are associated with
increased risk of myelofibrotic transformation from ET. Conversely, type 2 mutations are primarily associated
with ET, exhibit low incidence of myelofibrotic transformation, and are rarely found in PMF. The mechanisms
underlying these divergent clinical phenotypes remain unknown. We discovered that the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway
of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is differentially activated in type 1 versus type 2 mutant CALR cells, and
that type 1 mutant CALR cells are dependent on this pathway for survival and to drive ET. We found that
IRE1a/XBP1 is activated only by type 1 and not type 2 mutant CALR due to a loss of calcium binding function
specific to the type 1 protein. More recently, we found that the ATF6 pathway of the UPR is differentially up-
regulated in type 2 compared to type 1 mutant CALR cells, and that type 2 mutant proteins exhibit loss of
molecular chaperone function. These data support the central hypothesis that type 1 and type 2 CALR
mutations activate and depend on different arms of the UPR based on their respective losses of function, and
that these pathways promote distinct disease phenotypes. Thus, targeting different arms of the UPR based on
mutation type may represent a novel, individualized treatment strategy for type 1 versus type 2 CALR+ MPN
patients. To test this hypothesis, we will dissect the role of the UPR in type 1 mutant CALR-driven fibrosis
(Specific Aim 1) and type 2 mutant CALR-driven ET (Specific Aim 2), and determine if each is uniquely
sensitive to therapeutic targeting of different arms of the UPR (Specific Aim 3)."
10773156,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco retailer density is disproportionately high in low-income communities and certain racial/ethnic
enclaves, contributing to severe socioeconomic and social disparities in smoking and its resultant health
harms. Local, environmental-level interventions that aim to reduce the number of tobacco retailers are a new
policy frontier in tobacco control that may be particularly effective in promoting health equity, but the impact of
these initiatives is critically understudied in real-world settings. Three major US cities – San Francisco,
Philadelphia, and New York City (NYC) – recently enacted novel measures that establish caps on the number
of tobacco retail licenses permitted in city districts. Density reduction under this intervention occurs not through
license revocation, but gradually through retailer attrition. The effects of these “capping” policies on retailer
density reduction and the resultant tobacco product marketplace largely depend on temporal, spatial, and
store-level patterns in license forfeiture, which are not well-understood. Moreover, to comprehensively assess
public health impact, it is critical to conduct stakeholder analyses after implementation, describe the policy’s
impact on and mechanisms of behavior change, and identify potential unintended effects. The proposed
mixed-methods, comparative case study will use archival tobacco retail licensing data, annual audits of
tobacco retailers, semi-structured interviews with key community stakeholders, and geocoded health survey
data to evaluate this intervention and examine differential policy impact across neighborhoods and population
subgroups. Specifically, the project will: 1) Measure tobacco retailer density reduction and its association with
community demographics across study sites; 2) Longitudinally characterize changes in the tobacco
marketplace during policy implementation; 3) Qualitatively assess key stakeholder perceptions of the policy, its
mechanisms of action, and its behavioral impact; and 4) Identify associations between tobacco retailer density
reduction and smoking trends in NYC neighborhoods using a unique, annual population survey with geocoded
respondent data. Given the lack of empirical support for this nascent, environmental-level tobacco control
intervention, study results will provide timely, essential, and experiential evidence to inform equitable policy
formation and improve implementation in order to maximize impact and reduce persistent health disparities."
10756158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A broad range of diseases, from hypertension to structural heart diseases like aortic stenosis or coarctation of
the aorta, cause pressure overload stress on the heart. In response, the heart undergoes hypertrophy (called
pressure overload hypertrophy or POH) which can promote adaptation or cause heart failure. Understanding
the mechanism underlying these opposite clinical outcomes would create new therapeutic opportunities. The
unstressed heart relies mainly on fatty acids for fuel but alters energy sources depending on availability. POH
causes the heart to increase its reliance on glucose for energy, but, unfortunately, this metabolic inflexibility
impacts hypertrophic growth and ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, improving the balance of sources used for
fuel generation during POH could promote adaptation but therapies targeting this approach have not been
realized partially because the mechanisms underlying these metabolic changes are incompletely known. Our
preliminary results identified a new mechanism potentially impacting substrate preferences for energy
production in the citric acid cycle during POH that we pursue in this proposal. Posttranslational modifications
by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) globally increase in hypertrophied hearts in humans and
animals. A widely accepted dogma assumes that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) leading to the
O-GlcNAcylation of proteins depends on metabolic changes, especially in glycolytic flux. However, our recent
data suggests the reverse; that HBP flux and O-GlcNAc levels determine cardiac fuel utilization. We recently
performed the most comprehensive evaluation of protein O-GlcNAc changes during POH and preliminarily
identified increased O-GlcNAc levels on multiple enzymes for fatty acids and glucose metabolism. Accordingly,
we propose a new paradigm that HBP flux and O-GlcNAc are key regulators of fuel preferences for the citric
acid cycle during POH. Thus, O-GlcNAc could potentially be targeted to treat metabolic inflexibility and prevent
cardiac maladaptation during POH. We test our new paradigm with three specific aims: 1) using transgenic
mice, we will evaluate the effect of modifying O-GlcNAc levels on left ventricular function and remodeling in
POH, 2) we will determine the effect of modifying O-GlcNAc levels on fatty acid oxidation, glucose oxidation
and glycolysis during POH, 3) we will determine the regulation of HBP flux and O-GlcNAc levels during POH.
Our project provides essential insights into the regulation of fuel sources during POH, along with determining
the effects of increased O-GlcNAc levels during POH. This knowledge could help develop of new therapeutic
approaches to prevent or treat the common clinical problem heart failure from POH. This project addresses key
knowledge deficits on the regulation of HBP flux and protein O-GlcNAc during hypertrophy, as well as their
functional effects during hypertrophy. They will, therefore, provide essential insights on targeting these
mechanisms for preventing or treating heart failure."

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUcx) is a highly-selective, tetrameric Ca2+ channel that plays
a primary role in transporting Ca2+ from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix. Although Ca2+ uptake by
mitochondria plays a crucial role in stimulating ATP production, matrix Ca2+ overload can trigger opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore, leading to cell death. MCU dysfunction has been implicated in
several pathological conditions such as heart failure, ischemia–reperfusion injury, neurodegeneration, cancer
and skeletal muscle dystrophies. Recent biochemical and structural studies have shown that the MCUcx is a
macromolecular complex composed of a pore-forming MCU subunit, an essential subunit EMRE, and EF-hand
domain-containing MICU1–3 subunits. How each subunit of the MCU complex comes together and regulates
mitochondrial Ca2+ entry has been the focus of many recent studies. Using direct mitochondrial patch-clamp
methodology and an innovative heterologous expression system, we recently performed a comprehensive
structure–function analysis of the MCUcx in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This expression system
consists of gene knockout of each individual subunit of the MCUcx (more than 6 different knockout lines were
generated by CRISPR/cas9) and is readily amenable to different patch-clamp configurations with a high
success rate. Using this system and the patch-clamp technique, we propose to answer central questions in the
field: 1) Where is the MCU gate, and how is this gate regulated by Ca2+ and MCU accessory subunits? and 2)
How do the unique features in the MCU macromolecular structures (as revealed by recent structural studies)
relate to MCU gating and function? Accomplishment of the aims of this proposal will provide better
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate Ca2+ entry via the MCU and create an essential framework for
the development of pharmacological interventions that target MCU gating for therapeutic purposes."
10728884,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Regulation of Allergic inflammation by IL-9-secreting T cells
Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a pleuripotent cytokine that leads to altered gene expression and cellular function in
hematopoietic and structural cell populations. IL-9 is most efficiently produced by innate lymphoid cells, and a
specialized subset of T helper cells termed Th9 cells. Importantly, IL-9 has a role, in both humans and mouse
models, in asthma, food allergy, ulcerative colitis, and anti-tumor immunity. In the previous funding period of
this grant we have made considerable progress in understanding the regulation of the Il9 gene and the
transcription factors that are involved in controlling Il9 gene expression. As we defined systems for best
analyzing IL-9-secreting T cells in vivo, we observed that in a model of chronic allergen exposure, IL-9-
producing CD4+ T cells were in the tissue resident memory (Trm) population. We further observed that the IL-
9-secreting Trm population was stable in the absence of allergen exposure and was instrumental in mediating
the inflammatory response to allergen challenge after a period of ‘rest’ from allergen exposure. Blocking IL-9
during this post-rest challenge significantly diminished the inflammatory response. In this renewal application,
we will define the identity of the IL-9-secreting T cells, determine the transcription factors that are required for
their development, and identify the cytokines that are important for their development, maintenance, and
effector function. As the CD4+ Trm population in allergic inflammation has not been characterized and this
population is likely important in the context of intermittent allergen exposure as occurs in seasonal allergies,
the proposed studies could have a foundational impact on understanding how CD4+ Trm impact allergic
disease."
10749883,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Intense research has focused on the neurologic effects of prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection; however, the
consequences of postnatal infection early in life are understudied. Infants exposed to ZIKV in utero but born
without microcephaly can develop postnatal microcephaly, neurologic dysfunction, and neurodevelopmental ab-
normalities, highlighting the potential of ZIKV to cause ongoing damage after birth. This damage is likely related
to the exponential maturation of the brain that occurs during the first 2 years of life, particularly in temporal,
prefrontal and parietal regions important for emotional, social and executive functions, including learning, atten-
tion and memory. Our group has previously reported that postnatal ZIKV infection causes abnormalities in brain
structure, function, and behavior in a pilot study of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) infected postnatally. Here, we
propose to extend the scope and duration our prior pilot study and generate novel data regarding the impact of
postnatal ZIKV infection on the developing brain.
The Objective of this application is to bring new mechanistic insights into postnatal ZIKV infection to address
the existing knowledge gap regarding outcomes and host-virus interactions. We will use our postnatal ZIKV-RM
model to interrogate the neurobehavioral impact of ZIKV infection at different stages of postnatal brain develop-
ment, with approaches that span from single cells to whole animal. This model of postnatal ZIKV exposure allows
us to generate key data on the mechanisms by which ZIKV and/or the immune response to infection leads to
cellular changes that ultimately result in aberrant postnatal development of limbic structures and behavioral def-
icits later in life. We hypothesize that 1) ZIKV and/or the immune response to infection disproportionately affects
limbic structures in the postnatally developing brain; 2) cellular changes in these limbic structures lead to aberrant
neurodevelopment and abnormal behaviors; and 3) there may be a period of vulnerability to ZIKV during post-
natal brain development. We will test our hypotheses in these Specific Aims: 1) Determine the spectrum of
abnormal behavior and cognition following ZIKV infection of infant RMs at different stages of brain development;
2) Identify developmental trajectories of brain structure and function following postnatal ZIKV infection of infant
RMs at different stages of brain development; and 3) Define the neurodevelopmental pathways and cell types
impacted by postnatal ZIKV infection. This work will include RM infants infected with ZIKV at 1 or 6 months of
age (equivalent to 4 and 24 month old humans) as well as age- and rearing-matched and viral mimic controls,
that over their first 2 years of life will undergo a series of detailed assessments including validated tests of soci-
oemotional behavior and cognition, structural and functional brain imaging, brain histology, stereology and single
cell and bulk cell transcriptomics. Our results may have important public health implications for children living in
ZIKV-endemic/epidemic areas as well as for travelers to these regions."
10745709,"Project Summary/Abstract
Trauma- and cancer-induced tissue damage is common in the mandible. Critical failures associated with current
grafting treatments, like osteonecrosis, occur due to poor local conditions and limited integration between the
graft and the host tissue. Recent studies show that cartilage grafts produce well-vascularized and integrated
bone regeneration similar to an isograft, indicating that chondrocytes can form bones. As a mechanism, cell
trans-differentiation from chondrocytes into bone cells has been demonstrated. Yet, membranous osteogenesis
is currently considered the sole mechanism in the formation and repair of mandible body, despite two types of
cartilage (Meckel’s cartilage, MC; and Rostral Process, RP) present during mandible growth. Similar to the
mouse model, a RP-MC-like structure is identified in human fetuses and infants. To address whether
endochondrogenesis contributes to the growth and repair of mandible body, a series of studies using
complementary approaches has been performed. The key findings are: 1) the mandible body is composed of
both membranous and endochondral bones; 2) hypertrophic chondrocytes in MC and RP directly trans-
differentiate to bone cells instead of directly entering apoptosis; 3) RP-MC is one continuous cartilage; 4) a new
Condensed Mesenchymal Progenitor (CMP) zone is identified, which provides new cell sources for RP and MC
expansion; and 5) endochondrogenesis plays a key function in the mandible repair via a switch mechanism from
the default program (membranous bone) to a trauma repair program (endochondral bone), where
chondrogenesis (with limited requirement of angiogenesis) occurs first, followed by chondrocyte trans-
differentiation into bone. Based on these findings, the central hypothesis is that the mandible body is composed
of both endochondral and membranous bones, and that endochondrogenesis plays a key role in mandible repair.
To test this central hypothesis, three highly related, yet independent Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To determine
how MC and RP contribute to mandible formation via chondrocyte trans-differentiation; 2) To delineate the
mechanism by which RP is derived from the CMP, and the CMP-RP, a growth-plate like structure, converges
and elongates the two ends of MCs during mandible growth at cellular and molecular levels; 3) To determine
how endochondrogenesis contributes to mandible repair via a switch mechanism from the default development
program (membranous bone) to a trauma repair program (endochondral bone) through a change in the stem cell
fate. Completion of this project will 1) demonstrate that the CMP-RP-MC complex contributes to mandible growth
via the trans-differentiation of RP-MC chondrocytes into bone cells; and 2) identify some of key factors that are
responsible for the switch from membranous osteogenesis to endochondrogenesis via a change of the stem cell
fate in the repair process. These results will likely revise the current concept, provide new knowledge in this
largely unknown but vital area, and create a foundation for developing novel approaches, which will ultimately
accelerate future mandible trauma repair processes."
10767293,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of a number of chronic and progressive diseases and obesity-related metabolic diseases constitute a significant public health burden. It has long been known that obesity is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes precipitated by resistance to the effects of insulin. Over the past few years, there is also increased awareness that obesity is strongly associated with accumulation of lipid in the liver parenchyma (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)). The term, NAFLD, encompasses both hepatic steatosis (the accumulation of neutral lipid within the cytosol of hepatocytes) and the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (hepatic inflammation and fibrosis associated with steatotic lesions). A significant proportion of NAFLD and NASH patients will progress to cirrhosis and liver failure and are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is currently a disease without an approved treatment and constitutes a significant unmet medical need. Current therapeutic development is focused on drugs that either target fibrosis or aim to reduce hepatic lipid content. In clinical trials to date, insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) known to be ligands for the PPARγ nuclear receptor have shown some of the strongest effects on NASH of any experimental drugs. In the previous period of support provided by this grant, we tested the novel hypothesis that TZDs also engage and inhibit the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Indeed, we found that a next generation TZD (MSDC-0602) that engaged the MPC, but had markedly attenuated ability to activate PPARγ, reduced stellate cell activation and other NASH endpoints in a mouse model. Moreover, mice with hepatocyte-specific MPC deletion were protected from developing insulin resistance, diabetes, and NASH. On the strength of this and other experimental data, MSDC-0602 was advanced to a one-year, Phase 2b clinical trial (EMMINENCE: NCT02784444). During the previous period of support, we also identified a number of candidate compounds that act as MPC inhibitors and have preliminary data that these inhibitors also improve insulin sensitivity. Although there is now good evidence supporting the key premise that targeting the MPC is a viable therapeutic approach for treating NASH, many questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms by which MPC inhibition leads to beneficial metabolic and anti-fibrotic effects. In addition, previous work has primarily focused on the MPC in hepatocytes; the effects on stellate cells, which are critical to the development of NASH, have not been explored. This application has 3 overarching goals: [1] To test the hypothesis that novel MPC inhibitors will improve insulin sensitivity and NASH endpoints in mice. [2] To tease apart the molecular mechanisms of action of MPC modulators on insulin resistance and NASH endpoints. [3] To test the hypothesis that targeting the MPC in stellate cells contributes to the beneficial effects of MPC inhibitors. The overarching premise of this application is that targeting the MPC in hepatocytes and stellate cells will be useful for treating insulin resistance and NASH. These studies will define molecular mechanisms and provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting future clinical trials to test the efficacy of these drugs in patients with diabetes, NASH, and other obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases."
10757059,"This project seeks to reduce the burden of freezing of gait (FoG), which is suffered by over 50% of people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). FoG is a common, devastating manifestation of PD for which there is no cure or adequate medical or surgical treatment. FoG has been defined as a “brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet, despite the intention to walk”. It is widely known that FoG episodes are frequently triggered by various environmental and psychological factors. The most commonly recognized triggers include start hesitation (freezing upon gait initiation), walking through tight quarters, turn hesitation (freezing when changing directions), approaching a visual target, dual tasking, and stressful, time sensitive situations such
as entering an elevator before the doors close. Each individual with PD is unique with regard to how sensitive they are to these various triggers, underscoring the need for customized therapeutic approaches. A promising option for treating FoG is the use of tactile stimulation, however, no technology to date can provide customized therapy that adapts to the individual’s needs with regard to the specific triggering scenarios. In this proposed project, the Virginia Commonwealth University and William & Mary teams will work together to develop novel technology that deploys context-specific vibration stimuli tailored to the individual’s needs, with the goal of preventing or mitigating FoG. In Task 1, we will design and develop a wearable system for automatic FoG
detection and vibration delivery using existing technology (Ultigesture UG motion sensors, PDVibe3, and a smartphone). The device will be able to detect FoG immediately upon occurrence. In Task 2, we will determine the optimum dose of vibration frequency and amplitude for the five most common environmental and psychological triggers for FoG in a controlled environment (in the clinical lab). In Task 3, we will integrate a global positioning mechanism into the wearable system so that the device can recognize environmental triggers of FoG.
We will program the optimal parameters of vibration determined in Task 2 (for each of the five triggers) to deploy in response to corresponding environmental and psychological triggers and will test it in a real-world setting (a public place). Upon completion of this project we will have created and tested a closed-loop system that will deliver customized vibration therapy to people with PD at the precise moment it is needed to prevent or mitigate FoG episodes. This project aligns directly with the NINDS mission to reduce the burden of neurological diseases such as PD."

 Colorectal cancer is a devastating cause of mortality worldwide, with the majority of patients dying as a
result of hepatic metastasis. When feasible, resection of hepatic metastases provides improved overall and
disease-free survival; however, hepatic recurrence after surgical resection occurs in 50-60% of patients and is
the major cause of treatment failure. Pre-operative exercise therapy (PEx), which has been shown to improve
outcomes from major abdominal surgeries. It is known that exercise confers beneficial effects on the surgical
outcome by regulating multiple mechanisms, including alteration of quantity and function of innate immune
cells to provide an anti-inflammatory environment. Our recent findings demonstrate that PEx significantly
attenuates liver surgery-induced hepatic inflammatory response (i.e., ischemia/reperfusion). PEx induces an
anti-inflammatory phenotype in resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KCs) causing distinct metabolic shifts by
itaconate-mediated metabolic reprogramming. Our preliminary single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data
reveal that PEx causes dramatic transcriptomic changes not only in KCs but also in polymorphonuclear
myeloid-derived suppressive cells (PMN-MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, our
preliminary data indicate that PEx significantly decreases PMN-MDSC from forming neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs), an important mechanism that links inflammation to nearly every stage in tumor progression.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that that PEx ameliorates surgical stress-induced pro-
tumorigenic inflammatory responses and sustains an anti-tumor immune microenvironment in the
liver. In Aim 1, we will delineate the mechanisms of how PEx induces KC-mediated anti-tumor trained
immunity. We will test the hypothesis that PEx induces an anti-tumor trained immunity in KCs via metabolic-
epigenetic reprogramming, especially the itaconate/IRG1 pathway. In Aim 2, we will determine how PEx
remodels the TME by suppressing PMN-MDSC formation of NETs to suppress hepatic metastatic tumor
growth. In Aim 3, we will validate the effects of PEx on TME remodeling in patients undergoing liver surgery for
metastatic colorectal cancer. Our proposal will delineate the molecular mechanisms of PEx in the regulation of
immune cells in the TME of I/R-induced colorectal metastasis. The mechanisms discovered in these studies
will provide the foundation for devising new exercise therapies that are mechanism-based and effective in
improving surgical outcomes of cancer patients."
10734058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the United
States, causing 12,900 deaths in 2017. CDI has demonstrated a rapid increase in incidence in the last two
decades, with rate increases most pronounced in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
IBD, a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, has also demonstrated
increasing incidence in children worldwide and is considered a globally important pediatric disease. The co-
occurrence of IBD and CDI is associated with worse outcomes including longer hospital stays, higher charges,
and greater need for blood transfusions. Conversely, children with IBD also have high rates of C. difficile
colonization, defined as the presence of C. difficile in the absence of symptoms attributable to C. difficile.
Symptoms of CDI in IBD patients are indistinguishable from symptoms of an IBD flare in patients with C.
difficile colonization. Microbial perturbations, biomolecules associated with germination and metabolism, and
antitoxin antibodies have been studied individually for their influence on colonization and CDI but primarily in
cross-sectional approaches and not applied to children with IBD.
 The research detailed in this proposal responds directly to the need to better understand the
determinants and sequalae of CDI and C. difficile colonization in pediatric patients with IBD and includes the
following specific aims: 1) To investigate the role of germination and metabolic mediators as they relate to the
development of, and recovery from, C. difficile colonization, symptomatic CDI, and IBD flares. 2) To examine
differences in the intestinal microbiome that are predictive of C. difficile colonization, disease, and recovery in
children with IBD. 3) To determine the prevalence and impact of C. difficile antitoxin antibodies in children with
IBD.
 For the past 8 years the candidate has worked closely with her mentor, Dr. Kathryn Edwards on a
variety of CDI-related projects which have included the prospective enrollment of over 360 pediatric patients.
Through this project, the candidate plans to longitudinally follow children with IBD with serial sampling of stool
and serum to better understand the interaction of CDI and IBD. The overarching objective of this mentored
career development experience is for the candidate to emerge as an independent clinical investigator of C.
difficile and IBD, become established in metabolite determination and microbiome analysis, and serve as an
interface between clinical research and laboratory sciences through carefully planned translational
approaches. To accomplish this goal, the candidate will augment her prior training with advanced coursework
in microbiome analysis, clinical research, and leadership training. Throughout the award period, the candidate
will work closely with a multidisciplinary team of mentors including experts in infectious diseases, IBD,
biostatistics, microbiome analysis, and molecular techniques to carry out her stated aims and career goals."

 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani complex spp. causes between 20,000-
40,000 deaths a year. L. infantum is the cause of VL in the Mediterranean basin and imported to both South
and North America. L. infantum is zoonotic with canid reservoirs. Leishmania spp. are transmitted primarily
between mammalian hosts by female Lutzomyia or Phlebotomus sand flies. It has been established that both
sand fly and host factors modulate local dermal immunity when and where parasites first encounter skin,
guiding immunity locally and systemically and impacting infection outcomes. Relatively little is known about the
skin immune environment during progressive VL, how dermal immune changes alter host infectiousness or
responses to immunomodulatory sand fly salivary components. Skin parasite burden in dogs with L. infantum
infection correlates with transmission efficiency, more so than parasitemia, though dogs with late-stage
disease were less infectious than those with mild-moderate disease. We have shown that asymptomatic VL
clinical status was associated in dogs, as in humans, with productive Th1 type responses, while symptomatic
infection correlated with presence of exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, significant expression of Programmed
Death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1 on both B cells and macrophages and loss of macrophage parasite
clearance. These findings collectively lead us to hypothesize that immune cell responses in subclinical or
clinically infected hosts’ skin, whether from dogs or humans, dictate host infectiousness. We will address this
hypothesis through three specific aims in this proposed work, 1) Identify unique dermal immune environments
in subclinical vs. clinical hosts that alter infectiousness to naïve sand flies, 2) Evaluate how the functions of
sand fly salivary proteins are impacted by skin changes during progressive VL leading to new understanding of
vector saliva-host interactions and how they contribute to infectiousness to sand flies and 3) Evaluate how
alteration of the dermal immune environment through dermal immunotherapy alters bite-site inflammation and
transmission. The work proposed here is therefore significant, as it provides infection control relevant
evidence regarding the dermal microenvironment and how it alters infectivity during progressive L infantum
infection. The studies proposed here are significantly innovative as they quantitatively on a spatial level
assess how parasite burden and different dermal inflammatory states alter infectiousness to sand flies. Using
purified salivary antigens, skin biopsy, histopathologic and transcriptome analysis and a key unique natural
infection cohort, we will determine how progressive VL alters the landscape in which vector salivary proteins
operate with consequences for understanding both host infectiousness and the epidemiology of VL. When
completed, findings from these proposed studies will both underscore how progressive dermal inflammation
impacts reservoir host infectiousness and provide critical data to further assess appropriate interventions to
prevent canine-sand fly-human transmission."

Virus-specific CD8 T cells exert potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and SIV. Despite abundant
CD8 T cell responses, these are unable to fully suppress virus replication. This is likely due to
the majority of viral replication occurring in CD4+ T cells concentrated in specific areas in the
body, such as B-cell follicles in secondary lymphoid tissues and in intestinal tissues. Viral
reservoir studies indicate that the majority of SIV and HIV replication may occur in the intestinal
mucosa: After ART interruption, the location, abundance, and phenotype of recrudescing virally
infected cells are not well understood. However, emerging data suggest that both CD4 T cells,
as well as myeloid cells, in lymph node (LN) and the intestine are important contributors. Thus,
there is a need to develop methods to reduce viral load in mucosal tissues, as well as in LN,
and to more fully understand the source of viral reservoirs in non-lymphoid tissues. CAR T cells
can be potent mediators of immune control and these are being explored as an HIV therapy. We
have developed and begun testing an HIV/SIV targeting CAR. In this study, we have developed
and propose to test autologous T cells engineered to express the HIV-targeting CAR and CCR9,
a molecule that will target cells to the intestinal mucosa. We will test our hypothesis that
targeting HIV-specific T cells to the intestinal mucosa, as well as B cell follicles, will lead to
durable remission of HIV. We propose two aims to test the hypothesis. Aim 1: to determine the
in vivo localization, persistence and antiviral efficacy and impact on intestinal mucosa, lymphoid
tissue, and other tissue viral reservoirs in SIV infected ART suppressed rhesus macaques
infused with autologous CAR/CCR9 T cells. Aim 2: to determine whether combination therapy
using both intestine- and lymphoid follicle-homing CAR T cells is superior in promoting
sustained remission of SIV after antiretroviral drug treatment interruption. If successful, this work
may lead to an immunotherapy that leads to long-term suppression of HIV."
10745662,"Project Summary
 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable, chronic, interstitial lung disease
characterized by the accumulation of fibrotic tissue. A major risk factor for developing IPF is a
commonly found gain-of-function SNP (rs35705950) in the promoter for the respiratory mucin,
MUC5B. However, the mechanistic role of MUC5B in developing IPF remains unknown. Murine
animal models have elucidated some fundamental processes of lung fibrosis, but they have
failed to recapitulate key features of the human disease and have been unsuccessful in
identifying therapies that halt or reverse disease progression, likely because they are poorly
suited to replicate the impact of mucus and MUC5B.
 This highlights the critical need for 1) an animal model that represents the phenotypic
and mechanistic features of human IPF, including sustained fibrosis; 2) an improved
understanding of molecular mechanisms, including the genetic association with MUC5B
overexpression and the connection to disease pathogenesis; and 3) the identification,
development and evaluation of novel therapeutic targets based on this knowledge. With a
similar lung physiology and cell biology to humans, including Muc5b and other mucus proteins,
we have developed a novel bleomycin exposure model using ferrets. Bleomycin exposed
ferrets exhibit hallmarks of the human condition including persistent, sustained fibrotic lung
disease with collagen-rich fibrosis; Muc5b rich honeycomb cysts; fibroblastic foci; and prominent
airway remodeling displaying characteristic ‘proximalization’ of the distal airway spaces.
 Based on these data, our overarching hypothesis is that heightened Muc5b expression
promotes aberrant repair mechanisms to propagate fibrosis, representing a therapeutic target
that can be modeled in ferrets. In Aim 1 we will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to
test the effects of increased and reduced Muc5b expression on fibrotic lung injury and repair,
serving as a validation of model phenotype. In Aim 2 we will determine if smoke exposure (a
potent stimulator of Muc5b expression and risk factor for IPF) predisposes ferrets to progressive
fibrosis and worsens disease severity. In Aim 3 we will determine if Muc5b is a therapeutic
target for pulmonary fibrosis by administering Muc5b-specific antisense oligonucleotides to
reduce Muc5b expression or a novel synthetic biopolymer that normalizes Muc5b protein
structure and function in pathophysiologic airways. The goal is to develop a model of IPF that
provides novel opportunities to define how Muc5b expression contributes to IPF pathogenesis
and evaluate Muc5b-directed therapy, providing a definitive advance for IPF research."
10764811,"Understanding and leveraging molecular diversity within the phytochrome superfamily.
Our proposal focuses on the phytochrome superfamily of photoreceptors. We have a longstanding
interest in these proteins and in the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophores they use to detect
light. Members of this superfamily control growth and development of plants (seed germination,
photomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering, among other processes), making
phytochromes important research targets for enhancing agricultural efficiency to meet the
demand for food in the face of increasing human population. Other members of this family allow
bacteria to move, form biofilms, or adjust their metabolism in response to the light environment.
Phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs), the two families of proteins in the
phytochrome superfamily, are able to detect every color of light between the near-ultraviolet and
the near-infrared, including red and far-red wavelengths that are optimal for imaging in
mammalian tissue. Thus, basic research to understand phytochrome diversity, the mechanisms
underlying its function in plants, algae, and bacteria, and development of new imaging tools well
fits the mission of NIGMS.
 Research in the Lagarias lab leverages the natural diversity that has arisen in this
superfamily during evolution. We seek to understand the mechanisms that allow these proteins
to sense different colors of light, to either exhibit bright fluorescence or switch between
photostates, to integrate signals such as temperature or pH with light, and to report this
information to the cell. In the course of this research, we have also developed useful reagents
including fluorescent phytochromes, constitutively active plant phytochromes, and phytochrome-
null plants. In the next five years, we envision making further progress in understanding detection
of far-red and near-infrared light by these proteins. We expect to learn how to “re-tune” the color-
sensing mechanisms of a range of phytochromes and CBCRs, an insight which be applied to
existing reagents and systems to allow new imaging applications, multiplexing of synthetic biology
systems to respond to different colors, or tissue-specific applications in which specific targets are
activated with light rather than with gene promoters. These goals fit well with our overall goals of
understanding of the photochemical, biophysical, and biological processes of this family and
potentially yield advances in biomedical imaging and synthetic biology via development of a
knowledge base, improving fundamental methods with new reagents, and leveraging new
technologies."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are aggressive neoplasms that result in debilitating
changes in speech, appearance, and quality of life in humans. Response rates in HNSCC patients have
remained relatively unchanged over the years, especially in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)
negative HNSCC highlighting the critical need for novel strategies to meet the therapeutic needs of this patient
population. As recognized by PAR-17-245, a critical step in discovering novel therapies for HNSCC patients is
the development of tumor models that can reliably recapitulate human disease biology, heterogeneity and
therapeutic response. The overall goal of this application is to validate and credential a panel of patient-
derived and immunocompetent models of HNSCC. Systematic and in-depth comparison of histopathologic,
genomic, and therapeutic response profiles will be performed across multiple preclinical platforms in vitro
(organoids) and in vivo (allografts/xenografts). Paired in vitro and in vivo models across these platforms will be
used to assess their response to standard of care chemoradiation and immune checkpoint blockade. The
models will also be used to screen the activity of novel and FDA-approved agents (‘drug repurposing’)
targeting critical pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The application builds on an existing
collaboration between several investigators at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center with extensive
experience and expertise in mammalian models, head and neck cancer, cancer imaging, tumor immunology,
genomics, bioinformatics and cancer therapeutics. The project will employ innovative multimodal functional
imaging methods to better define and enhance the true translational utility of mammalian models. The proposal
will establish a robust panel of credentialed mammalian models of HNSCC and enable development of an
integrated preclinical pipeline to assess efficacy of novel therapeutics, identify resistance mechanisms and
enable biomarker discovery in HNSCC."
10647765,"Background: Despite widespread recognition of its prevalence and consequences, depression in nursing
homes remains a significant public health issue, affecting 15-25% of community nursing home residents and
contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, care burden, and cost of care. In VA Community Living Centers
(CLCs) the prevalence of depression is nearly 40% and within the first six months of discharge, CLC residents
have a substantially higher risk of suicide compared with other age- and gender-matched VA users. In
accordance with VA’s Strategic Priority to prevent suicide, it is critical to explore approaches to reducing
depression that are specific to the CLC population because depression is a major risk factor for suicidality.
Evidence-based psychosocial treatments are not often used in nursing homes and, when used, little is known
about the quality or effectiveness of the interventions. Behavioral Activities Intervention (BE-ACTIV) is a 10-
week evidence-based psychosocial intervention for depression developed using nursing home staff and
resident input to build in feasibility and acceptability. BE-ACTIV is typically delivered by a mental health
therapist in collaboration with recreational therapy to engage residents in personally meaningful pleasant
activities. This type of approach to improving mental health care is in line with VA’s strategic goals to provide
timely and integrated care that emphasizes Veteran’s well-being and independence.
Objectives: Three gaps must be addressed before BE-ACTIV can be used successfully in CLCs: (1) Adapting
it for the short-stay CLC population, is largely male with higher prevalence of serious mental illness and
substance abuse disorders, (2) Developing a delivery strategy that adapts BE-ACTIV’s current in-person
training and oversight processes for the context of a complex, national system of nursing homes, and (3)
Comparing implementation strategies to facilitate regional or national roll out. We will compare onsite and
remote applications of the LOCK implementation framework, which was developed for use in the CLC context.
The four tenets of the LOCK implementation framework are: 1) Look for the bright spots, 2) Observe, 3)
Collaborate in huddles, and 4) Keep it bite-sized.
Methods: This Hybrid Type 2 Implementation-Effectiveness study will use a mixed methods approach. In Aim
1, at two CLCs, researchers will (a) conduct telephone interviews with CLC staff about adaptation of the BE-
ACTIV training materials and implementation guide and (b) test the adapted BE-ACTIV VA training materials
and implementation guide for user comprehensibility with CLC staff. In Aim 2, 6 sites will implement BE-ACTIV
VA, each over a 6-month period. For this, three sites will have onsite training and check-ins for the
implementation and three will have remote training and check-ins. Aim 3 will be dedicated to finalizing the
training materials and implementation guide based on the input received from staff, our advisory panel, and
data collected at the 6 Aim 2 study sites.
Anticipated Impacts: The result of this work will be an evidence-based standardized manual for BE-ACTIV
VA to reduce depression among CLC residents and an implementation guide to incorporate BE-ACTIV VA into
the usual routines for resident assessment, care planning, and preparation for discharge. As an evidence-
based intervention developed for use in community nursing homes, BE-ACTIV VA has a high likelihood of
success if implemented effectively. Identifying a successful implementation strategy using the LOCK
framework will allow for wider dissemination of BE-ACTIV VA in CLCs nationally and create opportunities to
implement the intervention in other VA community-based long-term care programs (e.g., home-based primary
care, medical foster homes, State Veterans Homes, etc.). We will use the findings from this research to work
with our VACO partners and other communication channels to disseminate BE-ACTIV VA."
10918088,"The broad objective of this project is to develop imaging instrumentation and algorithmic technology to
perform non-invasive, real-time, in-vivo, 3D, virtual H&E biopsies. One in four people worldwide will
ultimately be affected by cancer. Surgical removal is the main treatment for most solid cancers. The surgeon is
tasked with the delicate balancing act of excising enough tissue to avoid leaving behind residual cancer cells
while not removing too much tissue, which can harm organ function. This is particularly important for brain
tumors, the most common type of solid tumor in children and the leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality. The
gold standard for detecting most solid cancers and confirming tumor margins is hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stained tissue sections, which require an invasive biopsy procedure. Unfortunately, current non-invasive in-vivo
imaging modalities do not produce images of comparable usefulness. We propose a novel imaging modality
called a ""virtual H&E biopsy'' that would generate H&E-like images of living tissue in real time. non-invasively up
to 1 mm into the tissue. This imaging modality would be able to provide real-time diagnosis of tumor margins and
invasiveness by scanning a large tissue area for residual cancer cells. Such information would guide treatment
decisions for diseases such as brain and skin cancer. Beyond its clinical benefits, this technology can also be
used for research into tumor development and tumor responses to treatment by providing in-vivo H&E-like
images of healthy and tumorous tissue microstructures changing over time.
To generate virtual H&E images, we will optimize a new imaging instrument we have developed based
on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and image translation by a generative adversarial neural network
(GAN). The key breakthrough enabling us to train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images is a technique called
optical barcoding, which we used to obtain a dataset of OCT images and corresponding real H&E images
aligned to single-cell precision. We have demonstrated this virtual H&E system with ex-vivo human skin tissue
samples. For the proposed project, we will first train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images of healthy mouse
brain tissue and glioblastoma mouse brain tissue ex-vivo (Aim 1 ). Second, we will use transfer learning to retrain
the GAN to generate virtual H&E images of mouse brain tissue of in-vivo OCT scan (Aim 2a), and track for the
first time how H&E images change as a mouse glioblastoma tumor develops (Aim 2b}. Finally, we will assess
whether the GAN can be retrained across species by applying transfer learning on the mouse-brain trained GAN
and use it to generate a virtual H&E biopsy of ex-vivo low-grade human glioma (Aim 3). To the best of our
knowledge, this will be the first time transfer learning has been applied across species for biomedical images.
Such transfer learning can accelerate virtual biopsy research since mouse samples are significantly easier to
obtain and handle, thereby opening up applications in locations where acquiring a human dataset for training a
virtual biopsy GAN would be difficult or impossible to achieve (e.g., the retina)."

computational modeling, with training and mentored research experience towards an independent research
career studying disrupted learning processes in anxiety disorders. Training activities will focus on: 1) clinically
informative applications of computational modeling and neuroimaging in anxiety, 2) advanced computational
modeling of uncertainty and exploration, and 3) ecological momentary assessment of behavioral avoidance.
This training will be facilitated by an interdisciplinary team of experts in computational and neural approaches
to understanding psychiatric disorders, neurally-informed computational modeling of uncertainty and
avoidance, and ecological assessment of clinically-relevant behaviors. Training will take place at the
Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a long and successful track record of
supporting junior scientists. To fulfill these training goals, the proposed research adapts approaches from basic
neurocomputational studies on uncertainty and exploration to apply to anxiety. Specifically, the proposed
research will test the hypotheses that anxiety, particularly anxious arousal, is related to disrupted learning
about uncertain, aversive outcomes, as measured by neural and behavioral measures; that disrupted
uncertainty learning leads to avoidance of uncertain options in anxiety; and that measures of uncertainty
avoidance relate to real-world behavioral avoidance. Participants (n=85), oversampled for high anxiety, will
complete a task assessing uncertainty learning while undergoing fMRI scanning. They will then report on real-
world avoidance behaviors for two weeks. Participants’ performance on the uncertainty learning task will be fit
to a computational model to measure learning from uncertainty as well as the tendency to explore versus avoid
options based on uncertainty. Measures of uncertainty estimated from the computational model will be
regressed against fMRI BOLD signals and behavioral choices; these effects on neural and behavioral function
will be tested for differences with anxious arousal. Individual variation in uncertainty-dependent exploration will
be tested for concordance with participants’ current real-world reports of behavioral avoidance and if they
predict future real-world behavioral avoidance. The anticipated impact, in line with NIMH’s Strategic Objectives,
will be identification of a) neural mechanisms for a complex behavior, maladaptive behavioral avoidance, b)
objective assessments of anxiety and avoidance, and c) possible novel treatment targets."

The endogenous opioid system is strongly implicated in the rewarding, reinforcing, and motivational effects of
ethanol, as evidenced by the established clinical efficacy of the opioid receptor antagonists naltrexone and
nalmefene in reducing ethanol intake, relapse propensity, and craving. Animal studies have demonstrated that
ethanol activates various opioid peptide-containing circuits within the brain, including regions of the
mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry and amygdala. Recently we have generated multiple lines of evidence
indicating that ethanol activates a subset of neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ArcN) of the hypothalamus
expressing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which gives rise to numerous bioactive neuropeptides including β-endorphin. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we observed that bath application of ethanol (5-40 mM)
increases the firing frequency of ~35% of recorded ArcN POMC neurons. Similarly, using FosB
immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that binge-like ethanol intake activates approximately a subset of ArcN
POMC neurons, the majority of which synthesize β-endorphin vs. α-MSH. Retrograde tracing revealed binge-
like ethanol intake primarily activates ArcN POMC neurons projecting to the amygdala, with fewer activated
neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc). Surprisingly, chemogenetic
modulation of ArcN POMC neurons without subpopulation delineation had no effect on ethanol intake. However,
we speculate that these lack of effects were due to the non-specific nature of activation of a number of ArcN
POMC neuron containing subcircuits. Baseline sex differences in binge-like ethanol intake were observed, where
female mice consumed significantly more ethanol than their male counterparts, and we observed that ERα is the
primary female sex hormone receptor located on ArcN POMC neurons as compared to ERα or progesterone
receptors. Together, these observations have led to our overarching hypothesis that ArcN POMC neuron
projections to regions of the mesolimbic reward system regulate binge-like ethanol intake in a sex-dependent
manner primarily via ERα dependent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we have formulated the following
inter-related yet independent Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of ethanol on the
neurophysiological properties of ArcN POMC projection neurons. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of
chemogenetic modulation of specific ArcN POMC efferent projection neurons on binge-like ethanol intake.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the role of ERα on POMC neurons in the regulation of binge-like ethanol
intake and potential interactions with midbrain dopamine neurons. Together, these studies will elucidate specific
opioid circuits and mechanisms regulating binge-like ethanol intake, which will guide the improvement of
neuromodulatory and/or pharmacological approaches for the treatment of alcohol use disorders."

Mitochondria are strategically trafficked throughout the cell by the action of adapter proteins, microtubule motors
and the actin cytoskeleton. The intracellular positioning of mitochondria supports subcellular levels of ATP, CA2+
and reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e. hydrogen peroxide, H2O2). We have provided direct evidence that
mitochondria actively traffic into the leading edge of migrating cells to support phenotypes associated with cell
migration. Deletion of the mitochondrial adapter protein Miro1 leads to perinuclear restriction of mitochondria in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts, leaving the cell periphery devoid of mitochondria. Importantly, cells lacking Miro1
retain normal mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our laboratory has shown that deletion of Miro1 disrupts subcellular
energy gradients, focal adhesion (FA) dynamics and significantly reduces cell migration. Cell migration is
rescued when Miro1 is reintroduced into cells lacking Miro1. However, the specific signaling events supporting
cell migration that are governed by local mitochondrial populations are still unclear. Our preliminary data provides
strong evidence that mitochondrial distribution dictates subcellular H2O2 gradients and therefore perinuclear
restriction of mitochondria in cells lacking Miro1 compromises leading edge H2O2 levels. H2O2 acts as a signaling
molecule, oxidizing specific cysteine residues in target proteins, influencing protein structure and function, a
process termed redox dependent signaling. H2O2 is rapidly consumed at sites proximal to the source
(mitochondria) and therefore must be produced in close proximity to the target. We find the oxidation of key
cysteine residues in proteins driving FA dynamics and cell migration are significantly less oxidized in cells lacking
Miro1. Addition of H2O2 to the extracellular milieu partially rescues cell migration phenotypes in cells lacking
Miro1. Therefore, we hypothesize that Miro1-mediated subcellular positioning of mitochondria induces localized
redox-dependent signaling events to support cytoskeleton and FA dynamics. We will test this hypothesis by
generating a spatial and temporal map of subcellular H2O2 levels dependent on Miro1-mediated mitochondrial
positioning in relationship to FA and cytoskeleton dynamics during cell attachment and migration. We will
investigate the importance of specific cysteine oxidation events dependent on Miro1-mediated mitochondrial
trafficking in supporting protein phosphorylation and FA and cytoskeleton dynamics. Lastly, we will investigate
how the subcellular architecture of mitochondria influences gene-expression patterns, with an emphasis on cell
migration genes. At the end of the proposed studies, we will have established a detailed mechanistic relationship
between the subcellular trafficking of mitochondria and redox-dependent signaling events governing gene
expression, protein post-translational modifications and FA and cytoskeleton dynamics during cell attachment
and migration."

Plasticity is a fundamental aspect of neuronal circuits across all species. It is at the base of
learning and memory, sensory adaption, and many disease-related processes such as addiction,
chronic pain or regeneration. On the molecular level biochemical mechanisms have been well
described, but little is known on how these are coordinated in space and time within neuronal
circuits of living brains. To elucidate the circuit operation of plasticity in vivo we here propose to
develop and validate highly sensitive, red FRET/FLIM sensors for simultaneous use with green
calcium sensors, allowing imaging of neuronal calcium activity and biochemical signaling
dynamics in individual synapses and neuronal populations. We will focus on plasticity-linked
biochemical events involved in synaptic plasticity and spine morphogenesis. FRET/FLIM sensors
will allow for the accurate measurement of small changes, even in the presence of brain
movement during behavior. In aim 1, we will develop highly sensitive red-emitting FRET/FLIM
sensors using mammalian cell based protein libraries and structurally-guided large scale
screening. Aim 2 will involve validation of sensors ex vivo and in vivo. Finally, sensors will be
validated for use in studies on synaptic and neuronal plasticity during spatial navigation tasks in
awake mice. We plan for iterative cycles of improvements in which input from biophysical analysis
of sensors, validation in slices and in vivo and feed-back from early roll-out users with different
animal models will be used to create successive sensor generations with ever increasing
performance. Combined in vivo 2P FRET/FLIM of plasticity and 2P fluorescence imaging of
calcium activity will provide a powerful new approach to study synaptic and neuronal plasticity in
living organisms."
10741821,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells undergo widespread investigation as
approaches to unleash the immune system’s tumor-targeting abilities, the mechanisms by which these therapies
fail is the subject of great debate. In the setting of solid tumors, it is believed that the microenvironment is hostile,
excluding T cells and/or inhibiting their ability to proliferate or be activated. A dearth of metabolic precursors,
most notably glucose, has been implicated as inhibiting T-cell function. There remains an unmet need for
approaches to better understand T-cell metabolism and its impact on tumors in vivo, as well as a method to modulate
this metabolic limitation to overcome T-cell exhaustion.
Given extensive preliminary data, we have developed a model system to explore T-cell exhaustion using primary T
cells stimulated in vitro. We have also identified a metabolic mechanism that can overcome limited glycolytic flux by
utilizing another biologically available substrate: fructose. Moreover, we have optimized methods to trace
metabolism in vitro and in vivo using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance (HP MR), which can detect changes in
metabolism in real time. Taken together, these approaches provide a platform for studying immunometabolism both
in vitro and in vivo in a syngeneic model of melanoma, which has great potential for future immunotherapeutics.
The objective of this innovative proposal is to utilize our in vitro and in vivo models to interrogate the metabolism of
T cells. In Aim 1, we will explore T-cell metabolism in vivo in order to reverse the reduced glycolytic flux in exhausted
T cells. In Aim 2, taking advantage of our newly developed HP fructose, we will metabolically image fructose
metabolism in T cells using our newly developed HP microNMR and in vivo with HP magnetic resonance
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). We will then translate this approach to tumor-bearing mice in Aim 3, where we
combine T-cell therapy and HP MRI to treat a syngeneic model of melanoma.
It is the overarching goal of this proposal to use these novel approaches in metabolism and metabolic imaging to
further our understanding of immunometabolism and lay the foundation for future immunotherapy strategies in
patients."

The study of retroviruses has resulted in important discoveries and led to insights into basic cell biology including 
mechanisms of cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and ultimately cellular transformation and cancer. 
Our collaborative work within this PPG focuses on HTLV-1, which is associated primarily with adult T-cell 
leukemia (ATL) and neurological disease (HAM/TSP) in a small percentage of infected individuals. Disease 
progression by HTLV-1 has been attributed to Tax, although we and others have hypothesized and provide data 
that another viral gene, termed Hbz, plays a critical role in the malignant process. Our presented data, as well 
as the work of others, indicate that hbz is multi-functional, playing important roles in both the RNA and protein 
form throughout infection and establishment of latency. We have extended our proposed work through PPG 
collaborations to better understand the manner in which hbz promotes proliferative and survival activity in cells. 
Proteomic analyses identified a panel of cellular proteins that distinctly interact with hbz RNA and HBZ protein. 
Functional characterization of these interactions are the next critical steps and the basis for this highly integrative 
continuation project designed to further define the role of hbz in transformation and disease. Our overall 
hypothesis is that uncovering the mechanism of actions of hbz RNA and HBZ protein will provide important 
insight into HTLV-1 cellular transformation and disease and ultimately will provide means for therapeutic 
targeting to eradicate HTLV-1 persistence in the host. This highly integrated proposal as referenced by Project 
and Core collaborations below has two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will dissect the mechanism(s) of action of hbz RNA 
and determine its contributions to the pathogenic process. We hypothesize that cellular protein interaction with 
hbz mRNA 2o structure translates to cell signaling pathways important for viral persistence and cellular 
proliferation. Our new proteomics data has identified, and we further validated, distinct cellular proteins that bind 
hbz mRNA. This aim will utilize in vitro approaches (Projects 2 and 3, Cores Admin/Biostats and Viral Vector) 
to identify the hbz RNA interactive region and determine the functional role of cellular binding proteins in cell 
proliferation. We will use in vivo approaches (Animal Core) to understand the contribution of the RNA and 
interactive proteins in the establishment of persistence and tumor formation. Aim 2 will dissect the mechanism(s) 
of action of HBZ protein and determine its contributions to HTLV-1 pathobiology. Our new proteomics data has 
identified, and we further validated, distinct cellular proteins that bind HBZ. In vitro approaches (Project 3, Cores 
Admin/Biostats and Viral Vector) including protein interaction mapping, cellular proliferation assays, and 
cellular transformation assays will be utilized to identify the HBZ interactive region and the functional role of key 
cellular binding proteins in HTLV-1 pathobiology. In vivo approaches (Animal Core, Project 2) will be used to 
determine the contribution of these HBZ interactive proteins in the establishment of persistence, infected cell 
survival, and tumor formation."
10746099,"Disturbances in RNA metabolism have emerged as an important contributor to several related neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and inclusion body myopathy (IBM). The familial and sporadic forms of these degenerative diseases are typically characterized pathologically by cytoplasmic inclusions composed of fibrillar deposits of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Moreover, mutations in RBPs or other proteins that regulate RNA metabolism frequently cause the familial forms of these diseases. Over the past 7 years my lab has been at the forefront of illuminating the molecular basis for these diseases, including identifying new diseases genes, elucidating the normal function of these and other disease-related genes, and determining the consequences of disease mutations. Based on these studies we have advanced the hypothesis that disturbance in the assembly, disassembly and function of diverse RNA-protein assemblies, including cytoplasmic RNA granules, underlies the pathogenesis of the aforementioned neurological diseases. We have developed a comprehensive research program that, over the next 8 years, will investigate the molecular bases of RNA granule assembly, elucidate in detail how RNA granule dynamics are regulated, determine the role of RNA granules in spatial and temporal control of gene expression, and most importantly elucidate the mechanism whereby defects in RNA granule dynamics contribute to neurological diseases."
10840784,"ORIGINAL PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is a great need for the development of molecularly targeted therapies in Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (ALL). The lack of targeted therapies for this disease is an important problem because ALL is
primarily a pediatric cancer, and intensive rounds of general cytotoxic chemotherapy have severe and long-
term adverse effects in children. Additionally, adults and children whose ALL does not respond to cytotoxic
chemotherapy, or who develop relapse, have a universally poor prognosis due to limited treatment options.
The well-known drivers of ALL are mis-expressed transcription factors, such as MYC, which are not easily
therapeutically targeted without undesirable side-effects on normal cells. Preliminary data, which built on a
novel in vivo transplantation screen in a MYC-induced ALL model in zebrafish, demonstrated that the tyrosine
phosphatase PRL3 collaborated with MYC to enhance leukemia progression. In vitro and in vivo studies using
human cells showed that PRL3 is linked with MYC expression, and plays a critical role in ALL survival.
Phosphatases like PRL3 are most well-known as tumor suppressors, and despite emerging evidence that some
phosphatases have oncogenic abilities, there are currently no phosphatase inhibitors used in the clinic for
cancer patients, and only one in clinical trial. The overall objective of this application is to clearly define the
oncogenic role of the tyrosine phosphatase PRL3 in MYC-driven ALL and to establish that it is a novel
molecular target in this disease. The central hypothesis is that PRL3 is a direct transcriptional target of MYC, and
synergizes with MYC to promote a pro-survival phenotype in ALL cells. The rationale for this research is that
PRL3 belongs to a unique family of phosphatases that can be selectively inhibited; defining the mechanisms
through which PRL3 promotes ALL survival will provide a strong scientific rationale for the development of
PRL and other phosphatase inhibitors for use as targeted therapy for cancer patients. This hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Define a mechanism through which MYC regulates PRL3 expression
by using enChIP and biochemical approaches to assess MYC interaction with a novel enhancer region near
PRL3; 2) determine the pro-survival mechanisms that are controlled by PRL3 by utilizing an unbiased biotin
ligase approach to identify PRL3 substrates in ALL cells; and 3) establish that small molecule inhibition of the
PRL family is a potent therapeutic strategy in ALL by completing comprehensive pre-clinical testing of three
new PRL inhibitors and a panel of FDA-approved tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. This research is innovative
because it departs from the status quo to use new methods to define an oncogenic role for a phosphatase in
cancer. The proposed research is also significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand
understanding of the role that phosphatases play in cancer progression. Ultimately, this knowledge has the
potential to drive the development of a new class of targeted therapy for patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and other MYC-driven cancers."

Salt-sensitive hypertension is a significant health problem worldwide and there is a need to understand the
underlying molecular mechanisms to enable more effective treatments. The proposed studies are based on a
strong scientific foundation with experiments performed in our laboratories in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats which
mimic the human condition of the disease. We have demonstrated that this form of hypertension is associated
with excess renal and vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reduced ability to excrete Na+.
Excess reabsorption occurs in the renal medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) leading to greater reabsorption
of filtered Na+. Most relevant to this grant, SS rats exhibit a reduced ability to generate ATP through mitochondrial
respiration in the mTAL, the tubular segment that is responsible for reabsorption of nearly 25% of the filtered Na+
of the kidney. In this region of the kidney, there exists high levels of oxidative stress (excess ROS production)
emanating from both the mitochondria and cell membrane NADPH oxidases (NOX2 and NOX4). Two of the
major gaps that remain in this field are first a lack of mechanistic studies of cellular/mitochondrial metabolism,
and second, an absence of approaches to quantitatively evaluate the interdependence of the complex cellular
processes. We hypothesize that a high salt diet which increases the delivery of Na+ to the mTAL of SS rats
results in excess Na+ reabsorption and an increase of mTAL cytosolic [Na+] which stimulates mitochondrial ATP
synthesis and ROS production which in turn stimulates membrane NOXs (ROS-ROS crosstalk and vicious cycle)
leading to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and tissue injury. Aim 1 will utilize
intact microdissected mTAL to test the hypothesis in SS rats that high salt diet increases cytosolic [Na+] thereby
stimulating mitochondrial ROS production which in turn enhances greater uptake of Na+ into the cell and though
ROS-ROS crosstalk of mitochondria and membrane NOX2 and NOX4 which amplifies total intracellular ROS
production leading to OxPhos uncoupling. Contribution of membrane NOXs and mitochondrial ROS interactions
will be determined using novel genetically engineered knockout strains SSNox4KO and SSp67/Nox4DKO rats. Aim 2 will
determine the progression of the postulated bioenergetic events in isolated mitochondria of the kidney (both
outer medulla and cortex) of high salt fed SS rats. Progressive alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics and
ROS production will be determined at four time points during the three weeks of high salt feeding. Aim 3 will
utilize the measured data-driven computational modeling to provide a quantitative, integrated, and mechanistic
framework that can predict the complex relationships existing between cellular oxygen utilization, energy
production, and oxidative stress in the kidney during the development of salt-sensitive hypertension."
10754239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Asthma remains a significant healthcare burden for children and has a long-term impact on their
development and health. Inhaled corticosteroids are key for managing asthmatic symptoms and disease
progression. However, children with severe asthma are insensitive or resistant corticosteroid therapies, leading
to the need for systemic use at high doses. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a key structural cell that regulates
airway function and tone. In severe pediatric asthma, airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and
remodeling continues despite aggressive corticosteroid treatments. Yet the underlying biological mechanisms of
corticosteroid insensitivity or resistance, particularly in ASM, remain undefined. Studies have reported
associations between Th1 inflammation, as indicated by increased Th1 lymphocyte airway infiltration and IFNγ
levels, and severe asthma. Additionally, we recently showed that combined exposure to IFNγ and TNFα uniquely
induces corticosteroid resistance in ASM. These data have led us to hypothesize that IFNγ and TNFα interactions
enable pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, notably NFκB and JAK/Stat1, to remain activated in the presence
of corticosteroids. Via 2 Specific Aims, we will use novel mouse and human models of corticosteroid resistance
to examine airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and remodeling in ASM. Specific Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that IFNγ enhances airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in ASM during steroid resistant
allergic airway inflammation. While Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that combined exposure to IFNγ and
TNFα opens chromatin structure, leading to corticosteroid resistance in human pediatric ASM. This proposal will
involve using cellular, molecular, and bioinformatic approaches to understand how interactions between IFNγ
and TNFα enhance Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional regulation in ASM. Furthermore, we will
examine whether targeting the JAK/Stat pathway can improve corticosteroid sensitivity in ASM and improve
airway function. These novel studies will expand the current understanding of how airway structural cells, such
as ASM, develop corticosteroid resistance while also beginning to define mechanisms that mediate corticosteroid
resistance in severe pediatric asthma."
11081868,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
 The glycocode, or collection of holistic features arising from specific combinations of glycan and protein
biomolecules, is a currency used at the cell surface to exchange information and direct biological processes.
The unique molecular surfaces created by specific glycan-protein combinations are a critical axis of information,
yet they remain poorly understood due to numerous analytical challenges associated with studying their
complexity. Emerging evidence from immuno-oncology, virus pathobiology, and beyond underscore that this
blind spot can no longer be afforded.
 This proposal generates a suite of new technologies to capture the combinatorial patterns of the
glycocode using innovations in mass spectrometry (MS) and chemical glycoproteomics. Together these will
enable systems-scale interrogation of the human glycocode. Aim 1 introduces a new platform for cell surface
glycoproteomics that retains glycan-protein patterns rather than relying on traditional protein-centric methods
that ignore the glycan component. By synthesizing novel chemical probes that append an easily enrichable
phosphonate handle to cell surface glycoproteins through live cell labeling, we provide a chemical
glycoproteomics platform for “catch-and-release” enrichment of intact glycoconjugates that provides access to
combinatorial glycocode features. Aim 2 accompanies our chemical glycoproteomics approach with advances
in the MS methods used to identify and quantify glycocode constituents (i.e., glycopeptides, glycoproteins, and
glycans). Through the use of real-time analyses to enable adaptive instrument control, we improve the sensitivity
and throughput of glycopeptide characterization. To complement bottom-up glycopeptide methods, we also
establish a novel top-down approach to fingerprint combinatorial glycocode modifications on intact glycoproteins
using ion-ion gas-phase chemistry to extract glycoform information from typically challenging denatured species.
In Aim 3, we leverage these tools to define a human glycocode atlas across 12 different cell types to connect
heterogeneous glycocode expression with specialized cellular functions. Furthermore, we extend this atlas to
investigate dynamic glycocode reprogramming during epithelial-mesenchymal transition to discover cell-type
specific signatures of migratory phenotypes that can be targeted in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
 In all, this proposal represents a significant advance in chemical glycoproteomics and MS methods,
generates a long-needed resource for cell surface biology, and provides a robust foundation for me to build an
independent research career focused on glycocode regulation in human health and disease. Key to
accomplishing these aims will be training in chemical synthesis to make novel chemical glycoproteomic reagents
during the K99 phase, which will equip me with the skills necessary to execute my vision for chemical
glycoproteomics to investigate glycocode. Work proposed here will be fundamental in my transition to
independence and will establish me as a leader in the promising field of systems glycobiology."

domains across the life course. The proposed Autism Center of Excellence, “Public Health and Autism Science
advancing Equitable Strategies across the life course” (PHASES) application proposes to employ an
overarching public health research framework to examine health determinants, health inequity – especially in
under-represented diverse populations – and health services delivery and their impact on health outcomes.
Projects in our center highlight different stages of the life course – early childhood, adolescence to young
adulthood, and older adults. Project 1 addresses predictors of age of diagnosis among young children with
autism, with emphasis on inequities in access to universal, high-fidelity screening during primary care visits.
Projects 2 and 3 examine Medicaid claims and other national data to address key issues arising from the
disproportionate burden of co-occurring health conditions in autistic adolescents and young adults (Project 2)
and middle age-to-older adults (Project 3). Project 4 develops a new tool to support transition from pediatric to
adult healthcare in young adults on the spectrum, with emphasis on minimally verbal adults. Each of the four
studies targets unique understudied groups characterized by potentially modifiable adverse outcomes: young
children with delayed autism detection, autistic adolescents and young adults with co-occurring conditions,
older autistic adults with co-occurring health and cognitive deterioration, and young autistic, minimally verbal
adults at risk for poor health care transition. The three Center Aims address the following research goals at
three different key life stages: Aim 1 investigates modifiable health determinants for autistic individuals; Aim 2
evaluates inequities in health and health services, especially in under-represented minorities and economically
disadvantaged persons on the autism spectrum; and Aim 3 examines the relations between health services
delivery and health outcomes. The Center will be supported by three cores facilitating synergy across projects:
the Administrative Core streamlines communication and collaboration across projects; the Dissemination and
Outreach Core facilitates engagement with diverse stakeholders and expands our existing activities to
emphasize bidirectional communication between our team and the community; and the Data Core ensures
quality, integrity, and security of data from large and diverse sources (e.g. Medicaid, Medicare, electronic
health records). Overall, the Center will address preventable adverse outcomes and promote wellbeing in
individuals on the autism spectrum, with a focus on several priorities identified by the Interagency Autism
Coordinating Committee, including research across the lifespan, reducing inequities, and improving health
outcomes for autistic persons."
10818323,"Y chromosomes of many organisms contain a large number of transposable elements (TEs), which are
transcriptionally constrained by repressive chromatin marks. When relieved of these epigenetic
modifications, many TEs can readily move from one genomic location to another (toxic Y
chromosomes). Yet evolutionarily young Y chromosomes still contain a large number of essential
genes that are actively transcribed, and competition between the opposing mechanisms of
heterochromatin formation and active transcription can result in incomplete silencing of TEs on
evolving Y chromosomes.
Our proposal aims to characterize epigenetic conflicts between host-specific genes and selfish genetic
elements on evolving Y chromosomes at various stages of degeneration, whose resolution may select
for adaptive degeneration of the Y.
The accumulation of repetitive elements on the Y chromosome appears to be universal during sex
chromosome evolution. We will take advantage of evolving neo-Y chromosomes in Drosophila with
varying levels of degeneration, to catalog toxicity of Y chromosomes using expression profiling and
chromatin analysis. We will link epigenetic and expression profiles across neo-Y chromosomes that
differ in gene and repeat density, to identify whether active transcription of genes on neo-Y
chromosomes results in incomplete silencing of TEs. We will establish whether toxic Y chromosomes
incur a fitness cost on males, by forming a mutational burden and reducing male longevity, as
suggested by our preliminary work. Integrating our results across aims will provide a full picture of
how the toxicity of the Y chromosome changes over time, and how epigenetic conflicts between host
genes and selfish elements may be resolved."

preclinical models, proteomics and functional genomics to understand the role of RhoA and RAP1GDS1 in
driving oncogenic KRAS in LUAD Our extensive preliminary data indicates that blockade of combined loss of
RhoA and RAP1GDS1 leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in a KRAS-dependent

In Aim 1, we will use functional and cell biology approaches to define the role of RAP1GDS1 in cell
proliferation and growth in 3D. We will also expand our studies to evaluate the role of other Rho proteins as
interactors with RAP1GDS1. In Aim 2, we will use proteomic approaches to further elucidate the

between RAP1GDS1 and RhoA. We will also explore the potential therapeutic implications of this combined
vulnerability using Rock inhibitors and inhibition of RAP1GDS1 interaction with key downstream proteins."

 Ca2+ elevations in the heart can serve as a signal for augmented energy output from
the mitochondria by directly increasing the activity of the electron transport chain and
select dehydrogenases. However, at the same time sustained elevations in Ca2+ that
occurs acutely after myocardial infarction injury can cause cardiomyocyte necrotic and
apoptotic death through opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP).
The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) complex imports Ca2+ across the inner
membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it can affect both energy production and
PTP opening during acute ischemic injury. Hence the MCU complex and many of the
more recently described genes that constitute it could be novel therapeutic targets for
drug design with the goal of reducing cardiomyocyte death or altering cardiac metabolic
performance. The genes that comprise the MCU were only recently identified hence the
field is still in its infancy with respect to genetically correlating mitochondrial Ca2+
regulation with cardiac physiology and pathophysiology in vivo. Here we propose to use
mice lacking some of these key molecular regulators of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling to
decode and differentiate between physiological and pathological Ca2+ signals at baseline
and with disease. Our overarching goal is to examine how mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and
efflux regulates cardiac life, death and metabolism. However, no single cardiac
laboratory in our field has the underlying expertise to both characterize the complex
biophysics of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and at the same time employ the necessary
mouse genetics and cell biology to truly achieve the stated goals of this project. Hence,
we are requesting to renew our collaborative dual-PI proposal that will be 50/50 effort
between the Molkentin and Bers laboratory, to wed the very best in mouse molecular
genetics and cardiac physiology with innovative assessment of mitochondrial and
intracellular Ca2+ imagining and PTP activity, respectively. Our Aims will be: Aim 1:
Examine how MCUb and the MCU complex regulates myocyte [Ca]Mito to affect
metabolism and PTP opening with IR injury, Aim 2: Elucidate NCLX regulation in cardiac
function, PTP opening and cell death after IR injury, and Aim 3: Identify the alternate /
slow [Ca]Mito influx effectors that operate independent of MCU in the heart. The 2 PIs
have a strong track record of working together with multiple shared publications and joint

The recalcitrant and harmful chemicals such as PFASs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances),
endangers the environmental, wild-life, and human health profoundly. Among different
strategies, bioremediation was established as an effective and reliable solution for remediating
persistent environmental contaminants like PFASs. Fungi, such as basidiomycetes (i.e. white rot
fungi) are used in bioremediation of PFAS for their strong extracellular biocatalytic capacity with
great promise. However, several factors limit commercial applications: 1) need for nutrient
addition as the carbon source for the microbe; 2) need to immobilize fungus biomass as pellets
to prevent fungus dispersion onto reactor wall; 3) bacterial competition; 4) low efficiency due to
the low chemical availability to the fungal mycelium and slow fungus growth. The proposed
research will address the imminent challenges of remediating persistent and toxic environmental
contaminants using the uniquely designed Nanomaterial-Fungus Framework (NFF). The NFF is
a system that novel nano-materials create a biomimic scaffold where fungus can grow, and the
scaffold enriches trace level contaminants that fungus can degrade. We aim to unveil the
fundamental biodegradation mechanisms of the NFF system, which provides future guidance to
modify and improve the system. The engineered NFF system will offer a novel strategy that
applies toward a broad range of environmental pollutant bioremediation practices."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects ~145,000 people/year in the US and is the 3rd most common cause of cancer
related deaths. CRC arises from early lesions that are pre-cancerous; these early lesions are colon adenomas
and serrated sessile lesions (SSL). Colon adenomas account for 80-85% of the CRC precancerous lesions and
progress to CRC via an early adenomaàadvanced adenomaàCRC sequence. In light of the well characterized
clinical natural history of adenomas, we plan to study them as early lesions and to determine the mechanisms
involved in the formation and progression of early precancerous lesions. Notably, only a few early adenomas will
progress to advanced adenomas (AA) and even fewer will progress to CRC. Our group and others have shown
that mutations alone are not sufficient to cause adenoma initiation and/or progression in the majority of cases.
There are likely multiple adenoma nonautonomous mechanisms that cooperate with the DNA alterations in the
adenomas to cause progression, and these mechanisms are likely operative in discrete subsets of affected
individuals. We and others have observed alterations, such as tissue senescence, high cancer driver gene
mutation loads, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, and dysbiotic gut microbiomes, in the normal colon of people
with advanced adenomas and CRC patients. We have termed normal colons with these features “primed colons”
and propose that these features are plausible mechanisms that affect adenoma initiation and progression.
Based on these observations and our prior studies, we hypothesize that early lesion progression requires a suite
of hallmark behaviors and that these behaviors are induced by adenoma autonomous factors (e.g. cancer driver
gene mutations) and adenoma nonautonomous factors from the “primed colon” or adenoma microenvironment.
 Our proposed studies will integrate basic and translational cancer research Projects to iteratively examine the
direct causal relationships and interactions of adenomas, the colon “primed” microenvironment, and host-
systemic factors as “co-organizers” of adenoma initiation and/or progression. The Specific Aims are:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects ~145,000 people/year in the US and is the 3rd most common cause of cancer
related deaths. CRC arises from early lesions that are pre-cancerous; these early lesions are colon adenomas
and serrated sessile lesions (SSL). Colon adenomas account for 80-85% of the CRC precancerous lesions and
progress to CRC via an early adenomaàadvanced adenomaàCRC sequence. In light of the well characterized
clinical natural history of adenomas, we plan to study them as early lesions and to determine the mechanisms
involved in the formation and progression of early precancerous lesions. Notably, only a few early adenomas will
progress to advanced adenomas (AA) and even fewer will progress to CRC. Our group and others have shown
that mutations alone are not sufficient to cause adenoma initiation and/or progression in the majority of cases.
There are likely multiple adenoma nonautonomous mechanisms that cooperate with the DNA alterations in the
adenomas to cause progression, and these mechanisms are likely operative in discrete subsets of affected
individuals. We and others have observed alterations, such as tissue senescence, high cancer driver gene
mutation loads, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, and dysbiotic gut microbiomes, in the normal colon of people
with advanced adenomas and CRC patients. We have termed normal colons with these features “primed colons”
and propose that these features are plausible mechanisms that affect adenoma initiation and progression.
Based on these observations and our prior studies, we hypothesize that early lesion progression requires a suite
of hallmark behaviors and that these behaviors are induced by adenoma autonomous factors (e.g. cancer driver
gene mutations) and adenoma nonautonomous factors from the “primed colon” or adenoma microenvironment.

10734044,"SUMMARY
In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American
Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI
communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade
inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on
T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused
on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory
mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly
involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also
modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic
inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for
adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example
of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly
men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A
and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an
ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical
data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering
childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research.
Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to
conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression
of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022-
23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic
profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A
epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control
(glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due
to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian
randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly
impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition
to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in
T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies."

The purpose of the smoking machine adaptor design project is to develop a standardized and validated
adaptor, or family of adaptors, for attachment to existing smoking and vaping machines to ensure the accuracy
and reliability of scientific data obtained from the study of the physical and chemical properties of electronic
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), cigars, and heated tobacco products (HTPs). Equally important, the project
will produce a set of protocols for the generation and collection of mainstream yield data for these four product
types. For the proposed research efforts, the Ohio State University (prime contractor) will collaborate closely
with the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), and with our proposed team
members, including our Particle and Aerosol Characterization Laboratory, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Tobacco Products Laboratory (CDC-TPL); our smoking and vaping machine industry partner,
Cerulean; and former Borgwaldt KC USA linear smoking machine design implementation engineer, Jeremy
Jones, President, Produced Better. The project is comprised of four main phases: 1) Feasibility, 2) Prototype
Design and Testing, 3) Adaptor Validation, and 4) Continued Stakeholder Support. Once the validation of the
adaptors is complete, our team will be responsible for the manufacture, sale, and continued device support,
including continuous design improvement, of the USMA in the final phase of the project and after CTP
sponsorship has concluded. The project will provide a public benefit by ensuring that stakeholders can
generate accurate scientific data and reduce measurement variability to help fill current scientific gaps
regarding the chemical and physical properties of ENDS, cigars, and HTPs. These data will assist FDA in their
mission to protect Americans from tobacco-related death and disease by regulating tobacco products and by
educating the public, especially young people, about tobacco products and the dangers their use poses to
themselves and others."

Malaria, caused by the protozoan Plasmodium is a devastating disease that kills close to half a million people
each year. Plasmodium transmitted by mosquitoes undergo asymptomatic development and replication in the
liver, before transitioning into infecting the red blood cells and causing the deadly clinical disease. Therefore,
hindering Plasmodium infection in the liver has been pursued as a strategy to delay, reduce the severity of, or
prevent clinical malaria. Although natural immune responses are known to control Plasmodium infection in the
liver, we understand very little about the mechanisms that underlie this process. This has prevented us from
harnessing the innate immune pathways in the liver to develop immunological or therapeutic approaches to
impede or eliminate Plasmodium infection in its liver-stage. Our group's long-term goal is to understand the
innate immune mechanisms that control Plasmodium in the liver. The objective of this application is to deter-
mine how type-1 interferons (IFNs) facilitate the elimination of Plasmodium from its host hepatocytes. Our
central hypothesis is that type-1 IFN signaling in the hepatocytes would enable the destruction of the para-
sitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), as well as the Plasmodium contained in it through `non-canonical au-
tophagy'. We propose to determine the mechanisms by which type-1 IFNs recruit the autophagy protein LC3
to facilitate the destruction of Plasmodium contained within the parasitophorous vacuole through lysosomal
degradation in Specific Aim 1, and how type-1 IFNs enable a class of interferon induced GTPases, called
guanylate binding proteins to cause mechano-enzymatic degradation of the PVM itself, to initiate a pathway of
programmed cell-death in the infected hepatocytes in Specific Aim 2. Type-1 IFNs are known to induce multiple
genes and pathways in various cell types. The rationale for the proposed research is that, by determining the
specific molecular mediators of type-1 IFN signaling pathway that enable the elimination of Plasmodium in
hepatocytes, we will have identified new, and specific therapeutic opportunities to better control or eliminate
Plasmodium in the liver. This knowledge will be applicable for the development of new immunoprophylactic
antimalarial drugs for travelers, or mass drug administration in malaria endemic areas. Such therapies can also
potentially clear dormant Plasmodium infections in the liver, or help improve live-attenuated anti-malarial vac-
cine candidates targeting the liver-stage of malaria. Our proposed research will employ a series of innovative
tools such as Cre-recombinase expressing Plasmodium capable of ablating specific host genes in only the
infected hepatocytes, and reporter hepatocytes that distinguish the lysis of Plasmodium from that of its PVM.
In addition to taking us a step closer to the control and possible eradication of malaria, at a fundamental level,
the completion of this proposal will foster the expansion of our knowledge pertinent to the improvement of
human health, advancing the core mission of the NIH."

Bladder cancer (BC) patients present with non-muscle (NMI) or muscle (MI) invasive disease, and 20% of NMI
progress to MI during follow up with a major reduction in survival. Hence, for this proposal we define early bladder
lesions as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and seek to address the two major clinical gaps in
NMIBC: 1) defining actionable mechanism of NIMBC progression; 2) risk stratification of NMIBC to patients likely
to progress. Project 1 is unique to investigate a novel and understudied tumor restraining mechanism, i.e., how
“immunofibroblasts” instruct the formation of ectopic immune cell microarchitectures known as “tertiary lymphoid
structures” to mount a local anti-tumoral response. Progress in studying immunofibroblasts and their regulation
of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation is hampered by the lack of preclinical study models recapitulating
the TLS phenotype. Project 1 is significant to i) reveal TLS phenotype in a published cohort of human NMIBCs,
ii) overcome a technical hurdle in the field by describing a consistent TLS phenotype within early bladder lesions
from a carcinogen-induced mouse model, and iii) discover a candidate immunofibroblast population that co-
organize TLSs with other lymphoid tissue inducer cells by single-cell RNA sequencing. Project 1 is innovative to
dissect the understudied roles of these immunofibroblasts and their interactions with lymphoid tissue inducers
and B cells to instruct TLS formation. Project Integration & Benchmark of Success: Project 1 will reveal
biological insights into the tumor restraining role of immunofibroblasts/TLSs and how they oppose the tumor-
promoting mechanisms proposed in Project 2. Furthermore, secreted proteins and factors from these
immunofibroblasts/TLSs will provide new candidate biomarkers for evaluation in Project 3. Success of Project 1
will validate immunofibroblast-mediated TLS formation as a tumor-restraining mechanism in early bladder lesions
and provide relevant targets for future precision intervention."

Bladder cancer (BC) patients present with non-muscle (NMI) or muscle invasive (MI) disease, and 20% of NMI
progress to MI during follow up with a major reduction in survival. Hence, for this proposal we define early bladder
lesions as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and seek to address the two major clinical gaps in
NMIBC: 1) defining actionable mechanisms of NIMBC progression; 2) risk stratification of NMIBC to patients
likely to progress. Project Integration: Project 1 & 2 address the first gap and provide new markers for Project
3 to address the third. The premise of Project 2, based on prior literature, is that progressing NMIBC harbor
similar cancer cell populations as MIBC. To test this hypothesis, we carried out single nuclei RNA sequencing of
MIBC and identified 18 distinct epithelial and stromal populations based on their unique gene expression profiles.
When gene signature scores of each population were calculated for NMI (N=327) and MI (TCGA) BC based on
their bulk RNA data, high scores of only one malignant epithelial and 2 cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)
populations associated with progression and survival, respectively. Only prevalence of CAFs expressing
fibroblast activation protein (FAP) stratified outcomes and progression of NMI to MI BC, suggesting FAP+ CAFs
cooperate with this epithelial population to drive progression. Spatial profiling found this epithelial population
proximal to CAFs, and ligand-receptor analysis suggested communication with CAFs, leading us to name these
cells “C3”, for “Cell-Cell Communication”. Interestingly, RNA velocity analysis to computationally decern lineage
relationships in the normal urothelium found cells with C3 gene signatures in a trajectory following basal cells.
Thus, C3 tumor cells may arise from transformation of normal C3 cells during differentiation. Our Specific Aims
test the Hypothesis that NMIBC progression is driven by C3 tumor cell intrinsic properties and C3 interactions
with FAP+ CAFs. In Aim 1 we use lineage tracing of our novel iPSC-based model of normal bladder development
which finds C3 cells and FAP+ fibroblasts emerge during bladder differentiation and spatial proteomic data from
normal bladder to test the hypothesis that C3 cells emerge from basal cells and promote the appearance of
FAP+ fibroblasts. In Aim 2 we examine the intrinsic determinants of transformation/progression of C3 cells using
functional genomics in an autochthonous murine model and human xenograft models of BC to test the hypothesis
that expression of some of 14 candidate C3 driver genes is necessary for carcinogenesis, tumor growth and
progression. In Aim 3 we co-culture human tumor cells with known levels of C3 with normal bladder fibroblasts
and BC CAFs and use murine BC cells implanted intravesically in mice with fibroblast defects in FAP to test the
hypothesis that C3 cells promote FAP+ CAFs, which reciprocally drive C3 expansion in a vicious cycle to drive
tumor growth and progression. Benchmark of Success: Aim 1 draws the first spatiotemporal portrait of a new
cell population in bladder differentiation and serves as a blueprint for how new populations should be evaluated;
Aim 2 & 3 provide candidates to develop for prevention and therapy as well as prediction of NMIBC progression."
10708912,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Bladder cancer is the second most common urologic malignancy affecting 573,278 people worldwide in 2020.
Pathologically, bladder cancer (BC) can be classified into non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI)
disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Major clinical
gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for
risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (i.e., “non-progressors”), from those that progresses
into MIBC (i.e., “progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle
this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early
lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk stratify aggressive
NMIBC (Project 3). Project 3 is unique to test the hypothesis that a bladder cancer-associated “fingerprint”
exists, which can be leveraged to risk stratify aggressive bladder cancer in a non-invasive assay as urine
biomarkers prior to its current clinical presentation. Specific Aims: 1) To prospectively evaluate a bladder
cancer-associated fingerprint” for its ability to risk stratify aggressive bladder cancer, with the propensity to
progress, before their clinical presentation; and 2) To evaluate the relationship of our bladder cancer-associated
“fingerprint” to early microenvironment changes within the stromal compartment, using a relevant and
established carcinogen-induced bladder cancer mouse model. Significance: We believe the BC “fingerprint”
can be exploited to identify aggressive bladder cancers that are more likely to be progressors from non-
progressors. Project Integration & Benchmark of Success: Project 3 will leverage a clinical grade, BC
“fingerprint” as a non-invasive assay. This will serve as an initial biomarker panel, while biology-backed insights
from Project 1 & Project 2 will reveal novel biomarkers associated with corresponding tumor-restraining and
tumor-promoting mechanisms, respectively. Such project integration will open the door for optimizing the non-
invasive method for risk stratification of aggressive NMIBC, and as such, it will have a marked impact on
patient care as the long-term goal."

This application for renewed support continues its focus on the mechanisms responsible for
aspirin sensitivity, a defining feature of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). AERD
is a debilitating clinical syndrome characterized by severe sinonasal and bronchial inflammation
resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and asthma, respectively. Few
therapeutic options exist, and none have disease modifying properties. Our proposal focuses on
a unique, platelet-driven mechanism through which endogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs),
specifically the parent cysLT LTC4, elicits biased signaling through the type 2 cysLT receptor
(CysLT2R) on platelets and other cell types to drive immunopathology through IL-33. The central
hypotheses are that LTC4 signals at CysLT2R to promote respiratory type 2 inflammation by
inducing the expression and release of interleukin 33 (IL-33) by both direct and indirect
mechanisms. A corollary hypothesis is that AERD involves a significant pathogenetic
contribution from an autocrine LTC4/CysLT2R-mediated platelet activation pathway that provides
IL-33 and other mediators that contribute to respiratory tract T2I and drive aspirin sensitivity. We
use a complementary approach with molecular tools, a unique set of transgenic mice, and
tissues and cells from carefully phenotyped human subjects to test the core hypotheses and
validate the biology across species. The studies should reveal new potential strategies for
therapeutic development that are based on a novel underlying mechanism,"

Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance in common bacterial pathogens threatens to reverse many
of the gains made in human health over the past century. This proposal details a research plan
designed to understand the basic biology of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in an important
group of Gram-negative pathogens, the Enterobacterales.
Aim 1 of this proposal concerns a novel, conserved protein that the candidate has discovered helps
mediate beta-lactam resistance in the Enterobacterales. Through targeted experimentation and
quantitative proteomics, the candidate will discover how this protein functions at the molecular
level. Aim 2A takes a broader focus, seeking to characterize how many mutations are necessary to
impart resistance in an important pathogen of hospitalized patients, Serratia marcescens. This is
important to determine, because if this sort of resistance is difficult to acquire, it may be prudent for
clinicians to use narrower, rather than broader antibiotics. Finally, in Aim 2B, the candidate strives
to identify proteins and pathways necessary for a kind of intrinsic resistance that a group of
Enterobacterales can utilize to become resistant to even the last-line carbapenem group of
beta-lactams. This approach has the potential to identify new antibiotic targets.
The candidate’s background includes training in biochemistry and eukaryotic cell biology, as well
as the clinical practice of infectious diseases. This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career
Development Award proposes additional training in genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics
necessary for an independent career investigating clinically relevant problems in the prokaryotic
cell biology of antibiotic resistance. With the guidance of his co-mentors, the candidate will obtain
this additional training using both formal coursework and hands-on training utilizing the best of the
resources available at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and
Harvard Medical School."

Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various
modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer
(FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more
than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the
analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project
(HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications
cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS.
Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI
images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all
modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS
provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM,
FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.
 The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG).
SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework
fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias
fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model,
it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more
segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield,
amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.
 The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal
models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface
placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In
addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by
creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for
software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type
of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer."

The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements account for approximately 80% of infant acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 35-50% of infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients bearing
rearrangements of the MLL gene are associated with dismal prognosis and particularly poor response to
standard treatments. Up-to-date, effective therapies for this subtype of fatal disease are still lacking.
Molecularly, inter-chromosomal translocations of MLL lead to in frame fusions of the N-terminus of MLL to the
C-terminus of various fusion partners, which are known as the “driver” lesions of the diseases. Among more
than 70 MLL fusion partners, a small subset of fusions account for most leukemogenic cases. In ALL, over 90%
MLL rearrangements involve only four fusion partners: AFF1, AF9, ENL, and AF10, all are components of the
super elongation complex (SEC) or the complex of the histone H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. It is believed
that these MLL fusions share a common pathway by “hijacking” SEC or the DOT1L complex to promote
aberrant activation of the target genes of MLL fusions, leading to the pathogenesis of leukemias.
Studies from the applicant and others have demonstrated that ENL, a stoichiometric component of SEC and
the DOT1L complex, is critical for the oncogenic function of the MLL-fusions. ENL contains an evolutionally
conserved YEATS domain. The applicant found that the YEATS domain of ENL functions as a reader of
histone acetylation (Cell, 2014, 159:558-71). Importantly, the acetylation reading function of the YEATS
domain is essential for growth and survival of the MLL-rearranged leukemic cells (Nature, 2017, 543:265-269).
These key findings provide the proof of concept that targeting the YEATS domain of ENL is a potentially
valuable therapeutic option in treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemias.
The goal of this proposal within the scope of this FOA is to develop potent and selective inhibitors of the ENL
YEATS domain. The specific aims of the proposal are to (1) conduct a high-throughput screening for ENL
small-molecule inhibitors; (2) validate and evaluate candidate hits by orthogonal assays; and (3) characterize
hits in cell-based assays. The inhibitors obtained from the proposed study will serve as tool compounds to
study the functions and mechanisms of ENL in promoting MLL-fusion proteins in gene regulation and disease
maintenance. These compounds will also provide the basis for further development of small molecules for
targeted therapies of MLL-translocated leukemias. Preclinical studies suggest that BET inhibitors exhibit limited
efficacy as single agents. Selective and potent ENL inhibitors provided by this project will be an important tool
to test the synergistic effect of ENL and BET inhibitions, providing an innovative therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemias."
10745303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The outcome of brain tumor surgery is critically dependent on the neurosurgeon's ability to distinguish between
abnormal and normal tissue in real-time. Our goal is to enhance this discrimination by using label-free
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to detect tissue biochemical and metabolic characteristics that distinguish
among different tissue types and, by integrating FLIm into the neurosurgical workflow, to provide this information
in a real-time, visual format useful for guiding tumor biopsy and resection. FLIm-derived tissue fluorescence
feature information will be co-registered with the preoperative-MRI (pMRI) and projected onto the conventional
surgical microscope field-of-view (FOV). This should improve delineation of tumor margins and thus increase
both the diagnostic yield of brain biopsy and the extent of tumor resection.
The proposed FLIm technique will incorporate the following features: (1) Safe, rapid, and simultaneous
measurement of time-resolved fluorescence decays in multiple spectral emission bands that will acquire
extensive information in one scanning measurement of a large area of tissue selected by the surgeon; and (2)
Fast analysis, display, and augmentation of fluorescence parameters that enable real-time visualization of optical
data encoding diagnostic information onto the surgical FOV. The proposed clinical studies using FLIm as a stand-
alone tool will establish classifiers to correlate FLIm parameters with specific tissue pathologies, an important
step in demonstrating FLIm's diagnostic value. The proposed integration of FLIm as an adjunct to the
neuronavigation system and surgical microscope will provide data for combined analysis to validate the benefit
of FLIm diagnostics in neurosurgical procedures. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1) Construct and integrate a
FLIm device as a diagnostic adjunct with conventional neurosurgical tools. Aim 2) Clinically evaluate the
relationship between FLIm parameters and distinct tissue pathologies and develop classifiers for different tissue
types. Aim 3) Validate FLIm for real-time intraoperative guidance through a prospective analysis.
In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time
assessment of neurosurgical margins and the resulting improvement in neuropathologic diagnostic yield. The
acquired FLIm parameter database will enable subsequent clinical trials for automated tissue classification and
diagnostic prediction. The new FLIm instrumentation, characterized by simple, fast and flexible data acquisition
and display, and its seamless integration with existing neurosurgical imaging, will provide a less expensive
alternative to intraoperative MRI and a valuable complement to current standard-of-care diagnostic procedures.
Success in this area will warrant a more generalized use of FLIm in surgical oncology (other cancers) as well as
guided interventions for treatment of functional neurologic diseases (e.g. epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases)."
10752686,"This proposal seeks to address a key challenge in public health : the ongoing and fine-grained
measurement of population mental health. Currently, in the largest population surveys, measurement of
mental health is limited in time to annual estimates, in space to predominantly metropolitan areas and in
scope to single questions about ""mental health"" or ""depression"". Through interdisciplinary work, we
propose to advance approaches to language-based analysis of social media to measure mental health,
sub-annually, ·at the county level and broaden the scope beyond depression to anxiety, stress, as well as to
protective mental health factors (such as healthy social relationships). This will provide the research
community with a much richer, timely and localized picture of population mental health.
The language of social media has been shown to be a flexible source of information about population
behaviors, thoughts and feelings It is available with high spatial and temporal resolution, suggesting great
potential for the study and monitoring of population mental health. However, approaches for tracking
psychological states across communities on social media were not developed with consideration for spatial
and temporal confounds or to fully leverage the multi-level structure (and sample sizes) of the data.
Proposed work will develop multi-level methods to control for spatial correlation and community
socioeconomic covariance to increase statistical power and the accuracy of measurement. The increased
power will also better enable quasi-experimental designs from epidemiology which will be combined with
the Twitter-based estimates to track the impact of policy and socioeconomic shocks on mental health.
The work in this proposal could significantly transform both research in population mental health and the
ability to apply and track the efficacy of policy to improve public health , It will allow researchers to observe
temporal changes in population mental health quarterly and for counties, which provides the measurement
infrastructure to observe changes in response to natural experiments such as economic shocks and policy
interventions. This will be possible in near real-time, without the reporting lag of a few years as in current
survey methodologies. The ongoing measurement will help identify areas of greatest need and may help
prioritize resource allocation. The improved quasi-experimental modeling of mental health determinants
may inform policy interventions, and the ongoing monitoring can establish evidence of their efficacy, In tum,
the burden of mental unhealth on society may be substantively reduced in the long term."
10754867,"Charge matters: Pursuing the most common, and least understood
molecular interactions in cells
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The long-term objective of the Süel lab is to determine and understand how ion fluxes and electrostatic
interactions regulate fundamental biological processes that promote stress tolerance in bacteria.
The central problem to be addressed: The vast majority of molecular interactions that occur within any living
cell have remained obscure. How can this be? Nearly all molecular interactions that have been studied to date,
and on which our current understanding of biology is based on, are covalent interactions. These interactions are
strong, making them suitable for experimental measurements. However, the vast majority of interactions among
molecules within the cell are non-covalent interactions that are based on electrostatics. Electrostatic interactions
can be weak and short-lived, and thus their measurements pose a great technical challenge. Consequently, how
such interactions are regulated and what functions they play in cells remains largely unknown. To bridge this
gap, we propose a research program to develop new devices, techniques, and a theoretical framework to
investigate the functional roles of electrostatic interactions, specifically in bacterial cells and biofilm communities.
Impact: The proposed work aims to investigate the regulation of ionic interactions and their functional roles in
bacteria, to better understand and control their tolerance to antibiotics. The resulting findings will determine how
changes in ionic strength and composition affect cell physiology. We will thus begin to characterize the dynamics
of the prokaryotic “metallome”. We will also integrate quantitative experiments with physics-based theoretical
approaches to identify general principles governing electrostatic interactions that can be applied beyond our
bacterial model systems. Given the tremendous number of ionic interactions within any given cell, it is very likely
that our work will uncover a new layer of molecular regulation of fundamental biological processes. Specifically,
we postulate the hypothesis of “ionic allostery”, where we propose that cells regulate their cytoplasmic ion
composition to modulate electrostatic interactions, and thereby globally regulate transcription and translation. In
particular, ionic interactions may play a crucial role in bacterial cell fate decisions, such as entry into, and exit
from dormancy, which is the major cause of antibiotic resistance. Our work will thus reveal whether “the central
dogma of biology” is modulated by changes in the ionic composition and strength of the cytoplasm and provide
a new paradigm for understanding and controlling the regulation of fundamental stress responses in bacteria."

Coma with fever is a common clinical presentation for children living in resource-limited countries. In endemic
areas, malaria is the most common cause. We previously established that EEG is a prognostic biomarker in
pediatric cerebral malaria (CM). In this research, we will use data previously collected as part of an
observational study enrolling Malawian children with non-malarial coma to identify if EEG is a diagnostic and
prognostic biomarker in this patient group. We will evaluate whether there are differences in EEG studies in
children with non-malarial coma and CM (a diagnostic biomarker). We will evaluate if there are EEG factors
associated with hospital discharge outcomes in children with non-malarial febrile coma (a prognostic
biomarker), as we did in our previous studies from children with CM. If EEG factors are associated with
outcomes in children with non-malarial coma, we will compare them to the EEG factors associated with
outcomes in children with CM. The results of this research may allow better clinical care of children with febrile
coma, as it may help determine if the underlying cause of illness is malaria or non-malarial. It may help
determine, at the time of admission, if a child with non-malarial coma is at higher risk of an adverse outcome."
10731057,"Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium spp., was responsible for nearly half a million deaths
in 2017, with an additional 3.2 billion people at risk of disease. While aggressive insecticide-treated bed-net
distribution, mosquito control, and anti-malarial drug distribution programs have significantly reduced mortality
associated with the disease, the disease continues to spread nearly unabated, suggesting that a vaccine against
this infection is desperately needed. Despite the slow pace of malaria vaccine design, several vaccines have
shown promise in the field demonstrating 30–50% protection in field efficacy or Phase 2 trials. Correlates
analyses have suggested that both humoral immune responses and cellular immunity may both play critical parts
in protection from infection; however, the precise mechanism by which these immune responses synergize to
drive immunity may provide the critical insights to advance the design of next-generation vaccines able to provide
higher levels of global protection. Moreover, field studies have highlighted the potentially deleterious influence
of pre-existing antibodies in endemic regions on vaccine response. Thus, under this proposal we seek to exploit
our Systems Serology antibody profiling approach, across a large array of sporozoite/early liver antigens, to
define both the correlates of immunity against malaria infection following PfSPZ immunization as well as to define
the specific mechanism(s) by which pre-existing antibodies shape the response to vaccination. Ultimately, the
results from this study will provide novel insights for the development of next generation vaccines against malaria."

 Dr. Brenton is a pediatric neurologist whose long-term goal is to become an expert in multiple sclerosis
(MS) therapeutics and risk factor modification. The training and mentored research experience proposed will
enable him to develop expertise in: 1) the conduct of multi-centered clinical studies, 2) use of MRI as a
research tool, and 3) obesity science. Dr. Brenton has assembled an expert team of mentors/advisors to help
him. Dr. Karen Johnston (primary mentor) is a highly-successful international expert in clinical trial conduct, Dr.
Myla Goldman (co-mentor) is a nationally-recognized expert in MS clinical research, and Dr. Brenda Banwell
(co-mentor) is a world-expert in pediatric MS clinical research. Dr. Brenton will take courses pertinent to
research methodology, the study of obesity and its relevant biomarkers, and the application of neuroimaging
techniques in clinical research. He will also spend 5 weeks at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to gain
hands-on experience with Dr. Banwell in the use of neuroimaging as a biomarker for pediatric MS outcomes.
 Children with MS, the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS),
experience failure of age-expected brain growth followed by progressive brain atrophy during adolescence.
These children often develop physical and neurocognitive disability at a young age. Childhood obesity is an
established risk determinant for pediatric MS, however, the impact of persisting obesity on MS disease course
is unknown. In non-MS children and young adults, obesity (a national health epidemic) associates with
progressive brain volume loss. In adults with MS, greater levels of obesity are associated with significantly
reduced normalized gray matter volumes. This is important, as gray matter atrophy is directly linked with
progressive disability in MS. The impact of obesity in children with MS has not been studied and the
implications of this are particularly important in a pediatric patient – where the negative impact of obesity on the
CNS may exert an even greater detrimental effect on a brain that is still undergoing development.
 We will conduct a cross-sectional, multi-center cohort study to determine the relationship between
obesity and biomarkers of 1) inflammation (measured radiologically by T2-hyperintense inflammatory lesion
volumes & serologically by adipocyte-derived cytokines) and 2) neurodegeneration (measured radiologically by
whole brain volumetrics & serologically by neurofilament light chain). This study will help define the role of
obesity in pediatric MS disease and will set the stage for future intervention studies aimed at modifiable risk
factors in MS. Upon completion of this award, Dr. Brenton will be one of the only child neurologists in the world
with formal training in pediatric MS in combination with training in obesity science and MS neuroimaging. His
proposal represents the first and only prospective study evaluating the role of obesity on pediatric MS disease
severity at presentation. This K23 will provide the necessary data and experience to inform future studies, and
he will be well-poised to apply for future R01 funding as an independent, collaborative clinician-scientist."
10747870,"Developmental remodeling of circuit connectivity is a key process in shaping the mature
organization of neural circuits in the brain, optimizing their connectivity in order to perform specific
functions. Remodeling is triggered by both environmental stimuli and intrinsic genetic
mechanisms, and deficits in remodeling processes are thought to be a primary factor underlying
altered patterns of connectivity observed in a variety of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
disorders. Despite the clear importance of these developmental processes for normal brain
physiology and health, there are major gaps in our understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that regulate neural circuit remodeling.
Studies of genetic models have proven to be extremely fruitful for identifying fundamental
mechanisms underlying neural circuit development and function. Our previous studies have
pioneered new approaches for elucidating mechanisms for the specification of synaptic
connectivity in a genetically tractable model, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. During the
previous funding period, we demonstrated the remodeling of postsynaptic specializations located
on GABAergic neurons in the C. elegans motor circuit, and showed that the formation of new
synapses during remodeling is associated with the outgrowth of previously uncharacterized
spines on GABAergic dendrites. Moreover, we uncovered a novel mechanism required for spine
outgrowth and synapse assembly that depends on the synaptic organizer neurexin. These
findings demonstrate the strength of this system for identifying key genes with conserved roles in
shaping neural circuit connectivity and place us in a strong position for a deep investigation of in
vivo molecular mechanisms. Indeed, in preliminary studies supporting this application we have
identified the homeodomain transcription factor DVE-1, a homolog of mammalian chromatin
organizers SATB1/2, as a key hub for regulation of synapse elimination during remodeling of the
motor circuit. In Aim 1 of this proposal we investigate a novel transcriptional network controlling
synapse disassembly and elimination. In Aim 2, we explore cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying the assembly of new synapses during circuit remodeling, focusing on the role of the
conserved synaptic organizer neurexin.
We expect that our studies of this experimentally tractable circuit in the worm will have a major
impact on our understanding of the molecular processes involved in circuit remodeling.
Additionally, we anticipate that the novel molecules and signaling mechanism we identify will be
excellent candidates for therapeutic intervention to treat neurodevelopmental disorders involving
disruptions in circuit connectivity."
10756065,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), like most neuropsychiatric disorders, are defined in general terms
through cognitive impairment and behavioral alterations. Advances in genome sequencing from large patient
populations has led to the identification of genes that cause complex NDDs. As a result, a major area of
basic research related to NDDs is to understand how these high-impact genetic risk factors disrupt molecular
and cellular mechanisms in brain cells and how these cellular alterations translate to changes in circuitry
and behavior. This ongoing R01 has historically focused on the neurobiological impact of a consensus NDD
risk gene, Syngap1, on the assembly and function of cortical synaptic connectivity in mice. In the current
budget period, we have made progress toward understanding the extent of touch-mediated behavioral deficits
and dysfunction within cortical circuitry that processes touch in the Syngap1 mouse model. The upcoming
budget period seeks to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between altered assembly, function,
and plasticity of cortical circuits and touch-associated behavioral maladaptations in this model. Based on
mounting published and unpublished preliminary data, we will test the overarching hypothesis that
Syngap1 regulates cognitive function and behavior by sculpting cortical circuits that promote tactile
perception. This hypothesis is relevant to NDD etiology because altered sensory processing is a ubiquitous
manifestation of NDDs, including ASD, SCZ, and ADHD. An idea gaining momentum in the field is that
alterations to cognitive function and behavior are caused, at least in part, through impaired sensory
processing within cortical circuits. This research topic is relevant to mental health disorders because
cognitive function is a major domain of brain function and perception is a construct that defines it. However,
the circuits that support perception, how they directly impact behaviors relevant to mental health disorders,
and how major genetic risk factors regulate them, remains poorly understood. Aim 1 will determine how
Syngap1 expression within tactile processing cortical neurons contributes to tactile learning and behavioral
phenotypes in Syngap1 mice. Aim 2 studies will determine how Syngap1 regulates mesoscale cortical plasticity
during tactile learning. Aim 3 is designed to provide insight into how Syngap1 expression in forebrain excitatory
neurons contributes to modulation of hindbrain arousal centers that support reinforcement learning. Overall
Impact: The proposed research has the potential to define cortical circuits that causally link impaired
sensory processing directly to NDD-associated cognitive and behavioral impairments. Such studies are
expected to inform the growing idea in the field that impaired cortical sensory processing directly leads to
behavioral maladaptations common to NDDs."

10756103,"Project Summary/Abstract
Psychological distress in breast cancer survivors is highly prevalent, significant, and costly. Studies show that
nearly half of all breast cancer survivors will experience clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or
anxiety in the first five years after their cancer diagnosis. There is robust evidence that cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for distress in cancer survivors. Unfortunately, access is
significantly limited by a lack of trained clinicians and expense. To overcome these barriers, smartphone
applications (`apps') have emerged as a feasible and effective method to provide low-cost delivery of health
information and treatment. To our knowledge, there are no publicly available mental health apps that have
been rigorously tested with cancer survivors. Members of our research team previously developed and
validated a publicly available, fully automated app-delivered mental health intervention, IntelliCare, which is
based on tenants of CBT. We recently conducted a pilot of the IntelliCare app suite in breast cancer survivors
and found that its use led to a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety, with particularly
robust effects among those with a moderate level of distress or greater upon study enrollment. The positive
result from our single-arm pilot leads us to the next logical step of testing the efficacy of the IntelliCare apps
against a robust control in a randomized study with long-term follow-up. The goals of this project are: (1) to
evaluate the efficacy of the IntelliCare apps in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in breast cancer
survivors, and (2) to test the impact of human coaching as a way to increase engagement with the intervention.
Using an innovative experimental design, called the Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial
(SMART), 313 breast cancer survivors with elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety will be randomized
to initially receive the IntelliCare apps or app-delivered Patient Education. We will test the effects of the
IntelliCare apps on symptoms of depression and anxiety at post intervention, 6 and 12 month follow-up (Aim
1). During the first week of app use, we will identify participants that are low-engagers of the IntelliCare apps.
These low-engagers will be re-randomized to receive coaching in addition to the apps vs. no change (i.e.,
continue using the apps naturally), to test the added value of coaching on engagement (Aim 2). Finally, we will
conduct semi-structured exit interviews with participants who receive the IntelliCare apps. Interviews will
capture survivors' perceptions about the extent to which, and how, tailoring the apps and coaching specifically
for breast cancer survivors may improve intervention outcomes and engagement. (Aim 3). Adaptive
approaches to promoting engagement, such as added coaching for those who struggle to engage, will balance
the competing needs for scalability and individualized attention to address rapidly expanding survivorship care
needs."
10884152,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the success of antiretroviral therapeutics (ARTs), they cannot eradicate HIV from reservoirs within the
body, particularly those in the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, opioids upregulate efflux transporters
further promoting subtherapeutic concentrations of ART in the CNS. We have used biocompatible ionic liquids
(ILs), molten salts comprised of asymmetric cations and anions, that can `tune' the affinity of nanoparticles to
different cell types. Using this strategy, we have developed an IL with a balanced affinity for erythrocytes and
microglia which promotes nanoparticle `hitchhiking' on erythrocytes to deliver them to the brain, and cells-
selective targeting of microglia once delivered to the central compartment. Preliminary data in rats demonstrate
~48% of injected nanoparticles accumulating in the brain within 6 hours, a vast improvement over current
nanoparticle delivery strategies. Preliminary analyses indicated that over 90% of CNS nanoparticles were
associated with microglia. We have further demonstrated the capacity to load ART (abacavir) into nanoparticles
which retained antiviremic efficacy when administered to HIV-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). We hypothesize that we can further improve the tunable profile of our IL formulation to optimize cargo
delivery to the brain and target additional cell types (including astrocytes). We anticipate that this cargo delivery
strategy will be safe and efficacious in spite of CNS cell adhesion/transporter changes promoted by opioid
exposure/dependence. To this end, we will (Aim 1) generate at least 5 novel ILs, in addition to our current lead,
with varied cell-type affinity. We will confirm the preference that ILs confer to simian and human blood
components as potential cargo carriers. (Aim 2) We will assess the safety (subacute, acute, subchronic,
reproductive, mutagenic) and biodistribution of up to 5 novel ILs in rats that are opioid-naïve or opioid-dependent.
ILs will be loaded with a premade scramble Cas9 vector with an eGFP reporter to confirm the capacity to deliver
CRISPR-Cas9 constructs for potential HIV cure strategies. Safe ILs with a CNS-favorable biodistribution will be
loaded with cART (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine) and assessed for efficacy in SIV-infected or HIV-
infected simian or human PBMCs, respectively, or human microglia. All cells will be opioid-naïve or opioid-
exposed. ILs with selectivity for microglia and astrocytes will be prioritized. (Aim 3) IL leads (based on CNS
distribution and microglial/astrocytic selectivity) will be assessed for in vivo safety, biodistribution, and acute
efficacy in a rhesus macaque model of SIV. In macaques, IL-assisted nanoparticles will be loaded with nanogold,
in addition to cART, to confirm the time-course of biodistribution via X-ray. SIV infection will be monitored via
CSF and blood draws. Complete blood count, chemistry, and cytokine profiling will be conducted on plasma
and/or CSF. ART distribution will be confirmed via LC/MS. Gross histopathology will be conducted on organs
and CNS tissues will be additionally assessed for microgliosis, astrogliosis, and sublethal neuronal damage. IL-
assisted nanoparticles may realize the goal of achieving safe, cell-specific, CNS drug/cargo delivery."
10741810,"The Global Burden of Disease estimates that ambient air pollution is responsible for over 4 million deaths per
year, yet regulators in the US, EU, India, and China have been reluctant to tighten standards, which can be
costly. Those costs and the observational nature of the epidemiology studies suggesting a tightening of
existing standards would be protective of the public’s health is a major reason for this reluctance. To date,
separate standards have not been set for particle components, and health impact assessments rarely
examine environmental equity because of the paucity of subgroup-specific concentration-response functions.
Further, studies on the effects of temperature on mortality and morbidity have focused on risk associated with
short-term exposure, and not longer-term effects which may be larger. We propose to address these gaps by
using national data (US Medicare and Medicaid data, and all age Death Certificate data from multiple states
geocoded to a census block group) on mortality and hospital admissions; to use causal modeling techniques
robust to omitted confounders by design; to extend methods for environmental mixtures to large data settings
and use them to assess nonlinear and interactive effects of exposures; to use state of the art models
estimating daily air pollution and temperature exposure for the contiguous US on a 1km grid for 18 years; to
use state of the art methods to estimate exposure error in the contiguous US, to use restriction and spline
methods to address low dose effects, and to develop and use state of the art measurement error correction
methods to account for exposure error when estimating these risks.
Specifically, we will use quasi-experimental designs (difference in differences and self-controlled) that control
for many unmeasured confounders, either by stratifying on subject (controlling for individual level fixed or
slowly varying covariates) or by stratifying on neighborhood (controlling for fixed and slowly varying
neighborhood level covariates), while continuing to control for measured covariates. For acute effects of
exposures, we will use instrumental variables to adjust for unmeasured confounding. We will access large,
ready-to-use datasets we have compiled, including national Medicare and Medicaid mortality and admissions,
and state-level geocoded death certificate data. We will use highly accurate national models we have
developed for daily pollution on a 1km grid, and increase resolution to 500 m. We will use a new mixture
model, fast Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), to address pollution and temperature mixtures,
identify interactions and nonlinearities, and identify which exposures are most important (including which
particle components) for a given health endpoint. We will use state of the art measurement error correction
approaches (SIMEX) to identify biases in the concentration-response relationship due to exposure error. We
will supplement the BKMR approach with analyses restricted to observations below current standards, and
spline methods with propensity scores to determine whether causal effects continue below current standards."
10747392,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In contemporary practice for people with HIV, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become an important
comorbidity. T2DM is 1.5 times more common in people with HIV than the general population. Among those
with T2DM, people with HIV have greater risk for weight gain, lower diet quality, and higher hemoglobin A1c.
All of this puts people with HIV and T2DM at substantial risk for complications, including chronic kidney
disease, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. Food insecurity, “lack of access to enough food for
an active, healthy life”, is a major contributor to this risk. Food insecurity is 2 to 3 times more common among
people with HIV than the general population. Food insecurity is associated with both worse T2DM control and
more T2DM complications.
 Medically tailored meal home delivery programs relieve food insecurity for people with HIV. Medically
tailored meals emerged to treat food insecurity among those with AIDS in the 1990's. Medically tailored meal
programs deliver fully prepared meals, tailored by a registered dietitian to an individual's medical needs.
Although HIV care has changed, medically tailored meal interventions for people with HIV have not kept pace.
Most medically tailored meal programs do not provide the intensive lifestyle intervention needed to counter the
health threats seen in modern HIV care. These threats include the metabolic effects of anti-retroviral
medications, chronic inflammation, aging, and obesogenic environments. For these reasons, it is critical to test
new models of medically tailored meal for people with HIV.
 Our research team has developed a medically tailored meal intervention that combines meal delivery with
an evidence-based lifestyle intervention designed to improve weight loss and diabetes self-management. The
goal for this project is to test whether this medically tailored meal intervention can lead to improvements in
hemoglobin A1c, weight, and in patient-reported outcomes such as food insecurity, quality of life, and diabetes
distress, compared with a standard medically tailored meal intervention.
 Thus, we propose a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to assess a community-based medically
tailored meals intervention (n=200). It will be conducted among diverse participants with HIV and T2DM,
referred for medically tailored meals. Adults with hemoglobin A1c between 7.0% and 12.0%, and BMI ≥ 25
kg/m2 (≥ 23 kg/m2 for those with Asian ancestry) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention or
standard medically tailored meals. The intervention group will receive meal delivery and intensive lifestyle
intervention for 12 months, while the comparison group will receive meal delivery along with standard nutrition
education for 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months. The primary outcome is
hemoglobin A1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include weight, food security, quality of life, and diabetes
distress."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the mechanisms that specify the fate of the germline, a fundamental problem in developmental biology. In all animals, the founder cells of the germline (primordial germ cells) display two conserved characteristics: they possess germ granules, RNA granules specific to the germline, and they express members of the Nanos family of RNA-binding proteins. The goal of this proposal is to understand how germ granules and Nanos function together to specify the fate of primordial germ cells. In preliminary work, we have found that PGCs that lack Nanos activity prematurely activates the expression of ~1000 genes normally expressed in oocytes and somatic cells, a phenotype also seen in mutants that lack the Polycomb Repressive Complex. Specific Aim I will identify the mechanisms used by Nanos to prevent this massive gene mis-regulation. We have already identified one promising candidate Nanos target: LIN-15B, a likely component of the DRM transcription factor complex that activates gene expression in oocytes. Specific Aim II will examine the role of a new group of germ granule proteins we recently characterized. The MEG proteins form stabilizing scaffolds around the central cores of each germ granule. Our genetic analyses indicate that the MEGs, but not the proteins in the core, are essential for PGC fate. We will investigate how the MEGs, predicted to be intrinsically-disordered with no recognizable domain, function with Nanos to specify PGCs. Two technical breakthroughs support this application. First we have worked out methods to isolate PGCs in large enough numbers to determine their transcriptome by RNAseq. We will use this method to define how Nanos and germ granule proteins affect the PGC transcriptome at a genome-wide level. Second we have developed a highly efficient genome editing method, using CRISPR/Cas9, that allows us to mutate, tag, delete and replace any gene of interest in just 4 days. This method gives us unprecedented genetic and biochemical access to the genes and proteins that are the focus of this application."
10689264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with the Group 3 subtype of medulloblastoma experience poor outcomes, with nearly 50% mortality
despite intensive treatment regimens. Thus, new treatment options are desperately needed. While prior efforts
have studied the ~20,000 known protein-coding genes in medulloblastoma, I have investigated >2,000 non-
canonical proteins that were previously excluded. I have discovered that MYC-driven, Group 3 medulloblastoma
cells are dependent on an upstream open reading frame (uORF) encoded within the ASNSD1 5’ untranslated
region. Perturbation of this uORF impacted the MYC cellular program, and it bound to the prefoldin complex,
which is critical for gene regulation. These findings provide a rationale to study ASNSD1 uORF as an oncogenic
driver in medulloblastoma and suggest that non-canonical proteins are a fertile territory for cancer discovery. To
advance ASNSD1 uORF as a potential therapeutic target, this proposal will pursue two specific aims in the
context of Group 3 medulloblastoma: (1) to validate ASNSD1 uORF in advanced cell line and mouse models of
medulloblastoma and (2) to confirm the role of the ASNSD1-prefoldin complex interaction in medulloblastoma. I
am an Instructor in Pediatric Neuro-oncology with at least 80% protected time for research, who is committed to
uncovering medulloblastoma disease mechanisms to advance patient care. My career goal is to become an
independent physician-scientist with research focused on novel medulloblastoma therapeutic targets. The
purpose of this career development award is to enable me to gain specific research training in medulloblastoma
mouse model systems, proteomics techniques and computational analysis. I seek to use these research skills
to advance my work studying non-canonical proteins as novel medulloblastoma vulnerability genes. I have
chosen an outstanding mentorship team of Drs. Todd Golub and Pratiti Bandopadhayay for this proposal. Dr.
Golub is an authority on the discovery of therapeutic targets and brings over 20 years of experience in mentoring
K08-level physician scientists. I have selected Dr. Bandopadhayay as a co-mentor because she is an innovator
in medulloblastoma and deep knowledge of medulloblastoma model systems. My advisory committee includes
experts reflecting key areas of my training plan: Drs. Steve Gygi (proteomics), Scott Pomeroy (medulloblastoma),
Ernest Fraenkel (computational biology) and Kim Stegmaier (pediatric genomics). Both my mentor, co-mentor,
and advisory committee are committed to my research training, career development and growth into an
independent physician-scientist at the conclusion of this award. I will train at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
and the Broad Institute, which are both outstanding institutions with unique research opportunities. This training
environment provides numerous opportunities for me to benefit from didactic coursework relevant to this award,
as well as participate in world-class research conferences. With the mentored research and career development
offered through this K08 award, I will be ideally suited to establish my independent career as a physician-scientist
in pediatric neuro-oncology."
10708917,"CORE B ABSTRACT
Core B [Spatial Transcriptomics/Proteomics & Bioinformatics Core] will serve as a centralized supporting hub to
provide service for i) retrospective collection of NMIBCs and clinical outcome, as well as prospective collection
of NMIBCs, ii) spatial transcriptomics and bioinformatics analysis, to assist the three Projects in achieving their
individual and common goals, i.e., to investigate the stromal microenvironment as a co-organizer for bladder
carcinogenesis and progression, and iii) full commitment to early tissue dissemination and data sharing. The
Core has the following aims: Aim 1: Collection of human NMIBCs and clinical outcome, for centralized
distribution. Aim 2: To generate a comprehensive spatial map of bladder cancer tumor microenvironment (TME).
Aim 3: Dissemination of tissues collected, or data generated from aim 1-3 for the research community. The
centralized operation in Core B is specifically organized and designed to maximize its output by supporting
complementary aims from Project 1, 2, and 3 to provide a comprehensive spatial map of the human bladder
tumor and stromal microenvironment, with emphasis in early lesions. Centralized tissue collection and data
generation, followed by pathologic and bioinformatic analyses will provide a streamlined process to visualize the
bladder TME and its relationship to progressor vs non-progressor MIBC patients."
10866551,"Project Summary: Anti-cancer drug treatments often do not completely eradicate all cancer cells in the body,
leaving behind “drug-tolerant persister” cancer cells (DTPs) that can ultimately develop drug resistance to
cause tumor recurrence. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to identify therapeutically targetable
vulnerabilities in DTPs to drive the development of treatment strategies for human malignancies. In estrogen
receptor alpha-positive (ER+) breast cancer, DTPs can persist for years despite endocrine therapies that
inhibit ER activity directly or via estrogen deprivation, causing tumor recurrences over a >20-year period. The
overall objective of this project is to determine how ER+ breast cancer cells utilize metabolic reprogramming to
tolerate and eventually overcome endocrine therapy. The central hypothesis is that ER+ breast cancer cells
survive endocrine therapy through a reversible metabolic switch that increases fatty acid metabolism,
mitochondrial respiration, and a protective oxidative stress response. The rationale for this project is that
definition of the metabolic vulnerabilities of DTPs in ER+ breast cancer will enable the rational development of
therapeutic strategies to suppress or eradicate DTPs and prevent cancer recurrence. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify vulnerabilities in fatty acid metabolism and respiration
in DTPs surviving endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer; (2) Define the role of the oxidative stress response
in the persistence of DTPs in ER+ breast cancer; (3) Determine the degree of plasticity of metabolic
reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer during disease progression from endocrine tolerance to resistance. In the
first aim, endocrine therapy-induced changes in respiration and fatty acid metabolism will be measured in ER+
breast cancer cells grown in vitro and in vivo as orthotopic cell line- and patient-derived xenografts that yield
spontaneous metastases. Using pharmacological inhibitors of key metabolic signaling nodes, these studies will
determine contributions of fatty acid metabolism and respiration to DTP survival. The second aim will identify
the timing and contributions of oxidative stress and the oxidative stress response to breast cancer cell
persistence during endocrine therapy. In the third aim, we will analyze the role of metabolic adaptation in the
acquisition and maintenance of resistance to estrogen deprivation in human tumor tissues and preclinical
models. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on (a) identifying
vulnerabilities in DTPs to be exploited therapeutically, and (b) determining how adaptations in DTPs enable
drug resistance, which will drive the rational development of drugs to prevent and manage recurrence. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide strong scientific rationale for the development and
future clinical trials of treatment strategies leveraging metabolic vulnerabilities in ER+ breast cancer, and yield
mechanistic insight into the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells."
10745673,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterized by progressive pulmonary scarring. Idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most common forms of ILDs and is a fatal lung disease with an incidence of 60
cases/100,000 individuals in the US annually. IPF has a median five-year survival of only 20%. There is presently
no cure. The pathogenesis of IPF is characterized by alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) senescence and apoptosis,
proliferation and accumulation of activated myofibroblasts and fibrotic lung fibroblasts (fLfs) and extracellular
matrix deposition. These features lead to progressive lung dysfunction. Morphologic changes include spatial and
temporal heterogeneity incorporating areas of normal lung adjacent to diseased areas containing apoptotic
AECs, and fLfs. Recently, pharmacotherapy has been shown to slow progression of IPF, suggest that even more
effective treatment can be developed. We found that increased p53 contributes to AEC apoptosis and fibroblast
activation, and that its decline in fLfs promotes myofibroblast expansion. We also found that caveolin-1 (Cav1)
is increased in injured AECs while its level is markedly reduced in proliferating fLfs from the lungs of IPF patients
and mice with established PF. We identified a 20-mer Cav1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP), and its truncated
7-mer fragment, CSP7, that inhibits p53, TGF-β, CTGF, AEC apoptosis and fLf expansion. These peptides block
PF in mice after single (1X) or multi-hit (8X) bleomycin (BLM), adenoviral TGF-β1 (Ad-TGF-β1)- and silica-
induced lung injury. CSP7 inhibits degradation of p53 due to increased mdm2 expression in fLfs and blocks their
proliferation. CSP7 also inhibits AEC senescence and apoptosis, which are otherwise increased in fibrotic lungs,
including in IPF. CSP7 is well-tolerated in mice and can effectively be delivered via the airways. Our work
validates Cav1 as a therapeutic target in PF. Our publications offer the premise for developing CSP7 for airway
delivery by nebulization (neb) or dry power inhalation (DPI) as a new, safe and more effective therapy for PF. In
Aim I, we will define cell surface binding/mode action of CSP7, optimize the structure of CSP7, identify the range
of dosing for effective airway (neb or DPI) delivery and assess the tolerability and ability of CSP7 to resolve PF
in 4 (1X BLM in young and aged mice, Ad-TGF-β1 and 8X BLM) models of PF. In Aim II, we will select the most
effective, well-tolerated, optimized form CSP7s (CSP7OPs) identified in Aim I, then evaluate non-GLP
pharmacokinetics, toxicology and evaluate systemic biodistribution after airway delivery. In Aim III, we will
elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CSP7OP combined with pirfenidone or nintedanib, affects injured
AECs and fLfs to resolve existing PF. Targeting Cav1 with CSP7 represents a novel and promising approach for
treatment of IPF via the airway. This project has a high probability of success and the data to be generated is a
predicate for IND-enabling work. Our team has all the requisite expertise in cellular/molecular biology, preclinical
modeling, drug discovery, formulation and airway drug delivery. This project will likely define novel and potentially
more effective therapy for patients with IPF or other ILDs, for whom effective treatment options remain limited."
10873833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the developed world. AMD
is characterized by progressive degeneration of photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that
may be accompanied by the development of macular neovascularization (MNV). MNV gets clinically apparent
when these new vessels become ‘exudative’. This exudative stage of ‘neovascular’ AMD can be treated by
application of biologics that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor. Without treatment, exudative MNV typically
results in extensive fibrosis with severe central vision loss.
Interestingly, there is a growing body of evidence that photoreceptor and RPE degeneration is slowed down in
eyes exhibiting ‘non-exudative type 1 MNV’ that is located in the sub-RPE space. However, the proof of a direct
protective effect of this specific MNV sub-type on visual function in AMD is lacking. The proposed project aims
to demonstrate (1) relative preservation of retinal function along with (2) preserved structure in the immediate
vicinity of type 1 MNV, whereas progressive loss of sensitivity and degeneration occurs in the surrounding tissue.
This will be approached by the application of in vivo high-resolution retinal imaging combined with spatially-
resolved testing of retinal sensitivity by fundus-controlled perimetry. Furthermore, given the need to minimize the
burden of laborious functional testing on patients and investigators in future studies in AMD, (3) artificial
intelligence will be applied in order to infer retinal function from high-resolution retinal imaging. Aim is to identify
a minimum set of clinical procedures that still allows estimation of spatially-resolved retinal sensitivity and that
may be implemented in future study protocols.
This research project challenges the current concept of AMD. Substantial evidence for a protective potential of
type 1 MNV would support the view that MNV development is actually an intrinsic ‘rescue mechanism’. This
project will provide essential information to interpret current treatment approaches in AMD and would also
provide a rationale for controlled MNV induction as therapeutic strategy to prevent vision loss in AMD."
10755287,"Abstract:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B cell malignancy that is characterized by the growth of neoplastic
plasma cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Despite progress in the clinical treatment of MM,
including the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, a considerable
proportion of patients develop resistance and become refractory to therapies. Drug resistance in MM is
enabled by evolving genomic alterations as well as by contributions from stromal components in the bone
marrow microenvironment. Specifically, the bone marrow provides a protective niche for slowly cycling/
quiescent stem-like MM cells that are not killed by chemotherapies. We have discovered sub-populations of
MM stem-like cells that preferentially localize to osteoblastic niches of the bone marrow. Gene expression
profiling revealed that a novel tripartite motif factor, TRIM44, is upregulated in MM stem-like cells isolated from
the osteoblastic niche. TRIM family proteins function as autophagy-regulatory receptors and TRIM44 gene
silencing decreases autophagy. In this project, we will investigate roles for TRIM44 and its links to protein
homeostasis control during MM initiation, progression and resistance to therapy. Our working hypothesis is that
TRIM44 plays integral roles in promoting quiescent MM stem cell survival within the bone marrow niche by
regulating pathways involved in proteotoxic stress. Furthermore, we propose that targeting TRIM44 or its
interacting proteins will result in diminished MM survival and improved outcome in response to therapy. To test
this hypothesis, we will (i) analyze signaling pathways regulated by TRIM44 and determine how components of
these pathways promote cell survival under proteotoxic stress; (ii) characterize novel substrates (from a recent
mass spectrometry screen) that selectively bind to TRIM44 and determine the functional significance of these
interactions in primary MM cells; and (iii) delineate the clinical relevance of these TRIM44-dependent pathways
in MM pathogenesis and relapse using xenograft mouse models. Our long-term goal is to selectively inhibit
TRIM44-dependent signaling pathways to benefit patients by reducing MM progression and/or blocking tumor
recurrence after therapy."
10749021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exacerbations (asthma attacks) account for nearly one-third of all asthma deaths. Despite psychiatric illness as
a risk factor for death from asthma, and many connections between asthma exacerbations and anxiety, the brain
region that initiates anxiety, the amygdala, has received limited attention as a driver of asthma exacerbations.
This represents a considerable gap in the field, which, if addressed, may lead to new mechanism-based
approaches to treat asthma exacerbations and reduce patient deaths. Exciting preliminary data from control mice
suggest that acute optogenetic activation of the basolateral amygdala, a key input center essential for anxiety,
reduces airway resistance. In asthmatic mice, which show anxiety, optogenetic activation of the basolateral
amygdala fails to reduce airway resistance, suggesting amygdala dysfunction. Amygdala dysfunction is
mechanistically linked to anxiety and characterized by heightened activity and spinogenesis (e.g., development
of new dendritic spines). Asthmatic mice showed spinogenesis, heightened activity, and elevated expression of
genes important for functional and structural remodeling in the basolateral amygdala. To investigate whether
these changes were mechanistically linked to impaired regulation of airway resistance, we blocked NMDA
glutamate receptors with MK-801, an anxiolytic drug that prevents anxiety-associated basolateral amygdala
spinogenesis and in a class of drugs that reduce airway resistance in asthma. We found that MK-801 mitigated
bronchoconstriction and diminished elevated gene expression in asthmatic mice. Broadly disrupting the cAMP-
responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor downstream of NMDA receptor signaling
necessary for maintenance of amygdala neuroplasticity, also attenuated bronchoconstriction in asthmatic mice.
These data guide our central hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala undergoes NMDA-CREB-dependent
plasticity that disrupts airway regulation and promotes pathologic bronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis,
we propose 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use optogenetic approaches to activate or inhibit excitatory neurons
of the murine basolateral amygdala to test the hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala regulates airway
resistance. In Aim 2, we use pharmacologic approaches, magnetic resonance imaging, RNAscope, and Golgi
staining to test the hypothesis that experimental asthma structurally and functionally remodels the basolateral
amygdala through NMDA receptor signaling. Finally, in Aim 3, we use CRE-lox technology and transgenic mice
to test the hypothesis that ablation or overexpression of CREB in the basolateral amygdala alleviates or
promotes, respectively, bronchoconstriction. Completion of this proposal will establish NMDA-CREB signaling in
the basolateral amygdala as a key driver of asthma exacerbations and highlight NMDA receptor antagonists as
a stand-alone or adjunct relief medications for asthma."
11145538,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (ADRD) is the most expensive medical condition20 in the US
and affects more than 5 million Americans21. Analyses from the ACTIVE study showed that a specific
type of computerized cognitive training (CTa) reduced risk of ADRD among older adults 29% across
10 years22. [Recent follow-up analyses indicate that ACTIVE participants with signs of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) at baseline randomized to CTa were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with ADRD
across 20 years23]. While these results are encouraging, MCI was not clinically diagnosed and thus
evidence is inconclusive to recommend CT for ADRD prevention. Many efficacious CT techniques
now exist but have distinct cognitive effects. Given that cognitive deficits are varied among those with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at higher risk for ADRD, a combination of CT techniques
may be most efficacious. Significant knowledge gaps remain as the best CT exercise(s) for those with
MCI is unclear. We were awarded a clinical trial planning grant to design and establish the feasibility
of the ACTIVE MIND trial (AG062368). We propose phase II of ACTIVE MIND, an adaptive random-
ized trial to identify the most efficacious CT exercises to improve everyday function in MCI. We will
further quantify the effect size of CT to reduce incident ADRD among persons with MCI. In this phase
II trial, our primary objective is to determine which CT arm results in the largest functional improve-
ments and has the best probability to reduce ADRD incidence. Our investigators include international
experts in CT, MCI/ADRD, recruitment and retention, neuropsychological assessment, neuroimaging,
biomarkers, and adaptive trial design. Our approach is to compare different CT arms to a stringent
active control condition with equivalent participant expectations. Measures will include innovative indi-
ces of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), standard cognitive assessments, as well as neu-
roimaging and novel blood-based biomarkers. Potential moderators of CT will be assessed to identify
who benefits. This study is innovative, in the application of adaptive trial methodology to efficiently
identify the most efficacious CT exercises to reduce ADRD incidence in MCI. We further explore neu-
roimaging and blood-based biomarkers as potential moderators of CT outcomes. Our premise is that
targeted CT improves everyday function (i.e., IADL), which subsequently delays ADRD onset. Our
long term goal is to improve older adults' functional trajectories and thereby curb ADRD prevalence.
The contributions will be significant, advancing our understanding of how CT may be successfully im-
plemented to curb ADRD prevalence. Significance is considerable given that an intervention delaying
the onset of Alzheimer's disease by only one year will result in 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease
by 205024."
10812440,"ABSTRACT, OVERVIEW
The Behavior of HIV In Viral Environments (B-HIVE) Center has been formed to further the understanding of
HIV-1 and HIV-1/cellular host factor macromolecular interactions within distinct cellular environments, which
shape the HIV replication cycle. With the limited size of HIV’s RNA genome, it is no surprise that many of the
same gene products end up performing different functions in different cellular environments at different times
during replication. These various HIV-1-cell host factor interactions promote the cellular pathogenesis, and
ultimately disease, characteristic of HIV-1/AIDS. All members have joined the B-HIVE Center with the common
goal to collaboratively investigate the dynamic HIV-1 and HIV-1/cellular host factor macromolecular interactions
within distinct cellular environments that occur during infection. The B-HIVE Center will capitalize on well-
established collaborations between top HIV researchers and scientific accomplishments that provide the
rationale to ask new and challenging questions and will be informed by the former HIVE Center (HIV Interaction
and Viral Evolution), an organizational structure proven to be effective at not only HIV-1 research, but also by
exemplary communication to training, and outreach activities. The B-HIVE team of highly collaborative
investigators includes well-established experts in structural, biophysical, chemical, and computational biology,
virology, and synthetic chemistry. Only as a Center do the researchers have the necessary combined expertise
and critical mass to effectively study the dynamic and mechanistic implications of macromolecular interactions
of HIV and cellular host factors within distinct cellular environments. The overall aims of the B-HIVE are organized
around three complementary Projects that focus on specific stages of the viral replication cycle:
Project 1. Dynamic HIV-1 core interactions with host factors and inhibitors from cytoplasm to nucleus.
 Aim 1. To discover and characterize novel, dynamic interactions between HIV-1 CA and host cell during virus
 ingress. Aim 2. To characterize interactions of novel small molecule inhibitors with distinct sites on HIV-1 CA.
Project 2. Structural dynamics of HIV-1 nuclear trafficking, integration, and transition to transcription.
 Aim1. Elucidate dynamic HIV-1 core-host cell interactions crucial for nuclear trafficking, uncoating, and
 integration. Aim 2. Define the structural and dynamic nuclear events underlying HIV-1 integration site selection.
 Aim 3. Determine the interplay between integration site and transcriptional latency.
Project 3. The dynamics of HIV-1 packaging and assembly.
Aim 1. Study the mechanism of HIV-1 RNA genome packaging and the proteins complexed with HIV-1 RNA.
Aim 2. Probe the cellular dynamics of the interactions between HIV-1 Gag and identified cellular factors that
alter HIV-1 production. Aim 3. Elucidate the dynamics of model Gag assembly and particle formation."
10741807,"Project Summary. Adaptive metabolic responses to hypoxia reflect essential evolutionary survival
strategies in all eukaryotes. We recently identified a unique metabolite that increases in cardiovascular
(CV) cells in response to hypoxia, L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG). This metabolite is derived from α-
ketoglutarate, or 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Once formed
from 2OG and NADH, L2HG has no other metabolic fate except to undergo oxidation back to 2OG by the
stereospecific dehydrogenase, L2HG dehydrogenase (L2HGDH), suggesting that it accommodates
(‘buffers’) the increase in reducing equivalents accompanying hypoxia. L2HG has two other unique
actions: it suppresses glycolysis and, as we show here, it increases pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
activity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that L2HG suppresses glycolysis and enhances PPP
activity in CV cells to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintain cell redox potential, and preserve
cell function in hypoxia. To address this hypothesis, we will focus on three specific aims. First, we will
determine the molecular metabolic mechanisms underlying the effects of L2HG on glycolysis and PPP
activity. In particular, we will focus on the unique role of a specific phosphofructokinase-2 isoform,
PFKFB4, as a key regulatory determinant of increased flux through the PPP in hypoxia. Second, we will
determine the effect of this L2HG-induced increased PPP activity in hypoxia on cellular redox potential
and intra- and extracellular ROS elimination. Here, we will focus on PPP-derived NADPH and GSH as
key cofactors in NADPH oxidase and glutathione peroxidase activities, respectively, in order to enhance
elimination of excess ROS. Third, we will study the effects of L2HG in hypoxia or ischemia on cellular and
cardiac function, respectively, using unique cellular and genetic murine models. Taken together, these
studies should provide insights into the mechanisms by which L2HG promotes metabolic remodeling to
preserve cell and cardiac function in oxygen-limited states."
10745693,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a devastating malignancy associated with severe
morbidity, high mortality and limited treatment options. The main subsite of HNSCC is the oral cavity, where the
disease presents primarily as tobacco- and alcohol-associated HPV(-) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Despite great progress in the understanding of genomic alterations in OSCC, the molecular details underlying
the progression of non-invasive oral lesions to advanced disease with lymph node metastasis remain poorly
understood. To gain insights into the mechanisms that contribute to OSCC progression to metastasis we have
studied the interaction between nuclear β-catenin and cAMP-response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein
(CBP) in OSCC by applying our newly developed computational methodologies coupled with genomic,
epigenetic, molecular, biochemical and functional analyses. Our published and preliminary studies show that
inhibition of β-catenin/CBP activity with small molecule antagonists, ICG-001 and E7386, in a panel of OSCC
cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and mesenchymal phenotype while inducing cellular differentiation. Similarly,
inhibition of β-catenin/CBP signaling in human OSCC cell line-derived tumor xenografts in nude mice inhibits
tumor growth and metastasis and abrogates rapid metastases driven by subpopulations of OSCC stem cell-like
cells, or cancer stem cells (CSCs), in embryonic zebrafish. Our recent global chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing (ChIPseq) studies show that β-catenin/CBP collaborates with the histone
methyltransferase, MLL1, to promote global H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at transcription start sites (TSS) of
numerous CSC genes. This finding is supported by our recent genomic analyses based on RNAseq and
scRNAseq data showing that β-catenin/CBP activity is associated with aggressive cell states, including CSCs.
Preliminary analyses also suggest that β-catenin/CBP complexes include the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and
TAZ (YAP/TAZ), which, like β-catenin, are associated with resistance to both chemotherapy and cetuximab in
HNSCC (19,20). Using well characterized OSCC cell lines, we integrated gene expression signatures associated
with the inhibition of the β-catenin/CBP axis with OSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to show
that β-catenin/CBP activity is associated with progressive disease and reduced patient survival. Building on these
collective findings we hypothesize that aberrant activation of β-catenin/CBP signaling underlies the expansion
CSCs during HNSCC progression to metastatic disease and that its antagonism may inhibit advanced disease.
This hypothesis will be tested in two aims that will: 1) define the role of the β-catenin/CBP axis in HNSCC
progression to advanced disease; and 2) determine the molecular mechanisms underlying β-catenin/CBP activity
in the induction of CSC phenotypes. Our studies will generate a dynamic integrated map aligning β-catenin-CBP-
activity with distinct aggressive cell states and their associated in gene signatures, signaling networks and protein
assemblies and provide a rationale for the development of new treatment strategies to combat this malignancy."
10708892,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common urologic malignancy affecting 573,278 people worldwide in
2020. Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here
we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights
defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress
(“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor
prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms
restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as
candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current
research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor-
restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder
lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors”
often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor
survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is
conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration
of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared
Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with
opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship
to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice
paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling
strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future
precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or
inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2). The overall success of our program is further ensured
by an extraordinary multi-investigator team that integrates three “organ-specific” bladder cancer investigators
within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All have active R01s and individual NCI-funding track record in performing
basic science research, translational bladder cancer research, or leading multi-center clinical trials on the
discovery and validation of biomarkers. Finally, they propose to collect valuable retrospective and prospective
NMIBC cohorts, which are essential to address the clinical questions posed within this proposal and will become
available to the research community as a shared resource to advance the field."

Johns Hopkins and Howard Universities, will accelerate the development of highly promising solutions to improve
neurological health for all. Solutions for all means also for the underserved, often synonymous with minority
groups. Diverse innovators should sit at the table on day one, but very few minority entrepreneurs exist. To
address these inequities, we will build NTH with an Equitech philosophy, which is the belief that diversity of
teams, leadership, and perspectives is a force multiplier to fuel innovation, producing solutions accessible to all
communities. Hopkins & Howard are uniquely positioned to realize this vision. Hopkins brings a foundation of
researchers, prestigious research centers, and programs and has a translation track record ($3B invested in
start-ups in the last 7 years). Howard complements this with a large pipeline of aspiring under-represented
minority (URM) innovators both within and outside the Howard community. Howard has nurtured this community
with early-stage mentorship, a successful incubator program, and recently received a $17M grant to create a
Center for Entrepreneurship aimed at building resources and support for Black business owners across the

 NTH will solicit proposals from innovators nationwide addressing pressing problems. Although the areas
supported will be broad, covering all participating NIH Institutes and Centers, the expertise of NTH will be
inclusive but focusing on Neuroprosthesis (cortical, spinal, peripheral, vision, and auditory), Brain Machine
Interface, Neuro Sensors and Devices, Neuro Informatics, Neuromodulation, and Mental Health. For funded

successful translation to first-in-human prototype. Specialists will be drawn from a diverse Steering Committee,
Advisory Board, and Consultant Network, composed of highly regarded clinicians, scientists, technologists,
commercialization experts, and patient advocates. To expand diversity amongst innovators, NTH has formed
strategic Outreach Partnerships with access to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving

10742927,"Summary
The p53 gene family occupies central positions in stress response networks throughout the animal
kingdom and, as transcription factors, these proteins specify robust adaptive responses. Furthermore,
the human counterpart is broadly implicated in age-related diseases including most cancers. Yet despite
extensive characterization, disease deterrence by p53 is not well understood and conventional
explanations for how p53 prevents oncogenic transformation have been fundamentally challenged.
Since p53 genes are broadly conserved, ancestral properties of these genes offer promising routes
towards understanding functions that become deranged in human diseases. Toward this goal, we built
tools to explore the p53 regulatory network in genetic models, enabling unique opportunities to
interrogate conserved properties that support human pathologies. These resources include in vivo
biosensors that visualize real-time p53 action and complementation platforms that exchange human
alleles for the fly counterpart. Leveraging these tools in flies and in fish, we discovered that p53 is
acutely sensitive to - and normally restrains - retrotransposons, which are mobile elements broadly
implicated in human disease. Likewise, we further showed that human p53 genes could similarly restrain
transposons, but mutated p53 alleles from cancer patients could not. These combined discoveries
suggest that p53 acts through highly conserved mechanisms to restrict transposons. Furthermore, since
human p53 mutants are disabled for this activity, our findings raise the possibility that p53 mitigates
disease, in part, by suppressing the activity of transposons. Consistent with this, we exposed
hyperactive retrotransposons in p53-driven cancers and found co-repression activity that is obligate for
p53 suppression. Initiatives advanced in this proposal build on these discoveries to determine precisely
how p53 restrains mobile elements. Our approach integrates genetic models with molecular systems to
deconstruct this process. Within this framework, we may deliver new opportunities for improved
diagnosis and treatment of conditions fueled by dysfunctional p53."
10741788,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed study is highly relevant to the 2017 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee priorities to
improve transition to adulthood in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It also advances NIMH’s mission to
develop interventions that: 1) assess the mechanisms through which an intervention produces therapeutic
change (Strategy 3.1); and 2) have been tested for effectiveness through pragmatic community-based trials
that examine implementation factors to improve the fit of the intervention (Strategy 3.3). Caring for transition-
age youth with ASD is a significant public health concern and the exit from high school is a period of amplified
risk. Individuals without intellectual disabilities (ID) comprise the fastest-growing subgroup of ASD and account
for two-thirds of the total population. Due to rising prevalence, there will be a 123% increase in the number of
youth with ASD exiting secondary school in the next decade. The educational system is increasingly the
primary service access point for youth with ASD, with as many of 90% served in public school settings. As
such, the transition from high school is often characterized as “falling over a cliff,” as youth with ASD lose these
educational and social supports. As few as 9% of autistic individuals without ID reach full functional
independence as adults, resulting in a loss to society, as well as to the youth and their families.
Impaired executive functions (EF) in ASD occur as a result of abnormalities in neural networks involving
prefrontal cortex, and are related to poor adult outcome. EF problems are pivotal targets for intervention
because they are common, linked to independence, and responsive to treatment. The proposed study will test
the effectiveness of a school-based cognitive behavioral EF intervention, Flexible Futures (FF), for transition-
age youth with ASD (AIM 1) and evaluate mechanisms of treatment change (AIM 2). FF targets flexibility and
planning skills and focuses on key functions needed for adult success: understanding one’s own thinking style
and advocating for accommodations; flexible problem-solving; time management; goal setting; developing
plans; monitoring progress. FF was designed from inception to be embedded in high schools and delivered by
school staff to improve generalization of skills, increase access to mental health care, and fill a gap in a lack of
evidence-based approaches to support postsecondary transition. A small, pilot randomized controlled trial
found students receiving FF made greater gains in planning, flexibility, adaptive, and classroom behavior when
compared to students receiving the usual ASD supports at school. This project capitalizes on the opportunity to
utilize pragmatic community trials to probe mechanisms of treatment change and explore barriers and
facilitators to implementation (AIM 3) to improve sustainable adoption and implementation of effective,
generalizable, evidence-based interventions. If successful, the proposed project will demonstrate the
widespread effectiveness and feasibility of an accessible intervention to improve transition outcomes for youth
with ASD that can be rapidly disseminated and implemented by schools across the nation."
10745674,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and end-stage lung disease of unknown etiology and
no cure. It is likely that genetic changes increase a person's risk of developing IPF, and then exposure to certain
environmental factors and/or aging trigger the onset of the disease. The MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950
is present in ∼50% of individuals with IPF and is recognized as the strongest known risk factor (genetic and
otherwise) for the development of IPF. This variant leads to overexpression of MUC5B mRNA and protein in
both distal airway epithelia and honeycomb cysts in the peripheral lung. These observations raise the question
of why excessive MUC5B expression in distal airways is associated with IPF? Recently, our laboratory identified
for the first time that the ER stress transcription factor XBP1S is highly expressed in the epithelium lining the
distal airways and honeycomb cysts of IPF lung, activates MUC5B gene expression by direct binding to its
promoter. Further, XBP1S differentially regulating the MUC5B promoter variant. These data connected activation
of ER stress with excessive MUC5B expression in a promoter variant-dependent model likely impairs mucociliary
clearance and function of distal airway stem cells that increase susceptibility of development of pulmonary
fibrosis. We hypothesize that activation of XBP1S induces MUC5B expression in the distal airways that
promotes pulmonary fibrosis. To test this central hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) XBP1S-
mediated MUC5B secretion in distal airway epithelium enhances susceptibility to development of
pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. We will assess the role of XBP1S by exposing Xbp1 airway epithelium-specific
overexpression or deletion mice to bleomycin induced respiratory epithelial injury. 2) XBP1S-mediated MUC5B
secretion impairs distal airway stem cell function to repair peripheral lung epithelia after injury. We will
utilize mouse airway epithelium-lineage tracing system and in vitro 2-D and 3-D differentiation assays to evaluate
the role of XBP1S and mucin in maintenance of the airway stem cell homeostasis in response to injury. 3)
Activation of XBP1S and presence of MUC5B promoter variant cause abnormal mucus secretion,
impaired mucociliary clearance and activation of myofibroblast differentiation. We will analyze the
biochemical and biophysical properties of the secreted mucus and electrophysiology of the DAE carrying the
MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 at baseline and after activation of ER stress. We will also test whether
XBP1S-expressing DAE carrying the MUC5B promoter variant and/or hypoxia-induced epithelial injury directly
promotes myofibroblast differentiation. Completing the aims proposed in this application will provide novel
mechanisms underlying ER stress-mediated excessive mucin secretion by DAE promotes pulmonary fibrosis.
These mechanistic studies will likely identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis as well as therapeutic targets
(e.g., suppression of XBP1S activation as a promising approach to resolve MUC5B hypersecretion, even for
those carrying the MUC5B promoter variant) in the distal lung to prevent or reverse fibrotic disease progression."
10915727,"Abstract/Project Summary
Kidney disease is common and deadly with frequent onset in childhood. Kidney and urinary tract congenital
anomalies account for most of the renal failure in children while, in addition, secondary acute kidney injury
(AKI) occurs in up to 60% of neonatal and pediatric intensive care patients, directly correlating with length of
stay, subsequent disability, and with early mortality. Kidney insults in childhood including ischemia, hyperoxia,
infection and nephrotoxic drug/environmental exposures impair kidney maturation and function resulting in
chronic renal disease (CKD) and with stealthier hypertension, renal stones and proteinuria. The development
of effective interventions and methods of early detection and severity measurements of renal disease in
children is lagging in part due to a lack of knowledge of physiological and pathological changes that occur as
the kidney matures. Molecular blueprints would dramatically enhance our ability to design effective
approaches to intervene and prevent kidney dysfunction. This goal cannot be met, however, without having a
source of pediatric kidney tissue to begin molecular interrogations to identify the uniquely human and
developmental, ’omic instructions required to make and maintain healthy kidneys. The objective of the
Washington University Kidney Single Cell Atlas Project (pKidCAP) is to create a highly unique and innovative
Pediatric Center of Excellence that delivers novel concepts, knowledge and resources by providing spatially
resolved single cell molecular maps of pediatric reference and diseased kidneys at several time points across
the pediatric lifespan. The pKidCAP investigators will apply paired snRNAseq, snATACseq technologies for
decoding gene regulation and expression from the same cell and use spatial transcriptomics to resolve the
cellular diversity with morphology using healthy and disease samples from pediatric kidneys procured from the
Biomedical core and in mouse model of glomerular disease. The educational and opportunity pool programs
will promote enthusiasm and progress in pediatric kidney disease research by 1) providing human age-specific
references for fetal and childhood kidney disease tissues, 2) enabling studies aimed to delineate cellular,
morphological, physiological and molecular changes associated with postnatal kidney maturation, 3)
accelerating scientific research aimed at ex vivo human kidney organoids, 4) establishing protocols for isolating
differentiated kidney cell types at stages consistent with those seen in kidney tissue samples, 5) advancing
drug toxicity screening, and by 6) designing validation studies of gene function and kidney engineering. The
availability of the tissue and the outstanding data generated from them will attract new expertise outside kidney
research developing spatial imaging and analytical technologies and research interested in physiological aging
across the lifespan."

Copper is an essential metal nutrient that plays important roles in human health and disease. The potent redox
activity of copper is required for a diverse array of physiological processes including respiration, antioxidant
defense, and hormone and neurotransmitter biosynthesis and metabolism. However, dysregulated copper
homeostasis can contribute to cancer, metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes, and heart and
neurodegenerative disorders, often through aberrant oxidative stress and damage pathways. We are
developing new chemical reagents that enable copper-specific imaging in biological models to help decipher
the contributions of copper to healthy and disease states, spanning the subcellular to cellular to animal level,
along with chemoproteomics approaches to identify and target copper-dependent disease vulnerabilities. The
scientific premise is that building a copper imaging and proteomics toolkit will provide foundational chemical
reagents to both further our understanding of the roles of copper in physiology and pathology and open new
avenues for therapeutic intervention. This competitive renewal application is driven by design innovations
where we invent new generalizable, activity-based sensing platforms for copper detection and activity-based
proteomics for copper-dependent disease targets, as well as scientific rigor in the synthesis and use of multiple
characterization techniques to apply these tools in cell and animal models. Specifically, we will pursue protein -
labeled copper probes to study how copper is stored, trafficked, and utilized at the subcellular and cellular
level, chemiluminescent indicators to enable dynamic and longitudinal copper imaging at the tissue and animal
level, and chemoproteomics approaches to identify copper-dependent druggable sites and covalent fragment
lead compounds against these targets."

In comparison to the highly protective E2 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE), the E4 allele has
been associated with a host of detrimental effects, including, but not limited to, increased
amyloid deposition, more severe tau pathology, heightened neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular
dysfunction, and various metabolic deficits. With its strong risk profile and varied biological
mechanisms, APOE itself has emerged as an attractive candidate for gene therapy. In addition
to providing a much-needed preclinical model for ongoing and future trials, exploration of E4 to
E2 allele ‘switching’ has the potential to help answer several fundamental and longstanding
biological questions in the field. For example, which ApoE-synthesizing cell-type(s) drive AD
pathogenesis in E4 carriers and which are most protective in those with E2? Are E4-associated
deficits set in stone at birth (developmentally), or is later-life APOE editing a feasible approach
to mitigate AD neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction? To this end, we have generated a
series of novel APOE ‘switch’ (4s2) mouse models that allow for temporal and cell-specific allele
switching from E4 to E2. Our preliminary data confirms that these 4s2 mice synthesize a full-
length human ApoE4 at baseline, and importantly, when crossed to various inducible CreERT2
strains, the switch successfully leads to efficient recombination and expression of human ApoE2
in cell types of interest. Given the remarkable protective effects of E2 carriage and the various
roles of ApoE at differing steps of AD pathogenesis, we hypothesize that astrocyte-specific
allelic switching to E2 will simultaneously rescue multiple metabolic, immune, and
neuropathological deficits associated with E4. We propose to leverage these unique mouse
models to determine the therapeutic window for CNS-specific E4 to E2 allele switching to
simultaneously mitigate metabolic deficits, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysfunction,
amyloid pathology, and cognitive dysfunction. If successful, this proposal will provide an
essential preclinical model for ongoing and future clinical trials, and will provide critical new
information regarding ideal cell-, region- and temporally-specific opportunities for therapeutic
ApoE modulation."

The equal segregation of chromosomes during cell division ensures the accurate inheritance of genetic
information. Aberrant chromosome segregation can cause an imbalance in chromosome number, or aneuploidy,
which can result in spontaneous abortion and birth defects and is a major cause of cancer. The locus required
for the equal segregation of chromosomes is the centromere. In humans, centromeres are comprised of
repetitive α-satellite sequences that span several megabases on each chromosome. The repetitive nature of
these regions has challenged efforts to determine their sequence, structure, and variation using short-read
sequencing data. As a result, we have a very limited understanding of the natural variation of centromeres and
the impact of this variation on essential cell biological process critical for life. In this proposal, I aim to address
this gap in knowledge by sequencing and assembling centromeres from diverse humans using a combination of
long-read sequencing technologies and novel computational assembly tools (Aim 1; K99 phase). Additionally,
I propose to assess the natural variation of human centromeres at the genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional
level using innovative computational methods and multiomic sequencing approaches, ultimately building a model
of human centromere variation (Aim 2; K99 phase). Finally, I propose to determine how variation among
centromeres affects the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division using cell-based assays, long-
read sequencing, and multiomic sequencing approaches (Aim 3; R00 phase). Together, this work will provide
the first comprehensive assessment of human centromere variation and reveal how this variation affects
centromere function in cells. The tools, resources, and skills developed in the K99 phase will be applied in the
R00 phase to determine the functional consequences of centromere variation and its role in human health and
disease. My goal is to build an independent research program that spans the gap between genomics and
centromere biology. I will receive the necessary interdisciplinary training from my mentor (Dr. Evan Eichler), co-
mentor (Dr. Sue Biggins), and the rest of my postdoctoral advisory committee (Drs. Deborah Nickerson, Andrew
Stergachis, and Kelley Harris). In addition, I will participate in career development activities offered through the
University of Washington and the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center. Together, my research training,
mentors, advisory committee, and academic environment will prepare me well as I transition to an independent
position as an academic scientist."

The overarching goal of the proposed renewal of the PERU CTU is to continue contributing to the design and
implementation of the NIH HIV/AIDS clinical trial networks research agenda, across the continuum from
prevention to treatment of HIV and tuberculosis (TB). It builds upon 19 years of experience and over $110 million
of NIH investment to establish a comprehensive clinical and laboratorial infrastructure for designing and
implementing network research studies, including those from the HVTN, HPTN, ACTG, MTN and INSIGHT, as
well as several non-network clinical trials. The consortium is led by Asociacion Civil Impacta Salud y Educacion
(IMPACTA) and is also composed by the Centro de Investigaciones Tecnologicas, Biomedicas y
Medioambientales (CITBM), the Asociacion Civil Selva Amazonica (ACSA) and the Asociación Via Libre.
Multiple principal investigators are Dr. Jorge Sanchez (based at CITBM) and Dr. Alberto La Rosa (based at
IMPACTA) and supported by a cadre of experienced researchers and promising junior investigators. A
consolidated three-dimensional (3D) matrix organizational structure integrates organizational functions (CTU
governance and Clinical Research Sites, CRSs), support functions (through four resource units) and production
functions (local teams leading specific trials). This 3D matrix interplay allows for operations that are cohesive,
synergistic, integrated, transparent, flexible, responsive and adaptable. It provides efficient utilization of
infrastructure and resources, avoiding redundancies, providing centralized services, sharing strategies and
optimizing cost containment. Two mature Community Advisory Boards are the cornerstone for successful
community participation in all stages of research. The PERU CTU proposes to continue conducting the networks
research agenda at five CRSs: ACSA (HPTN, HVTN), Barranco (HVTN, ACTG), CITBM (HPTN, HVTN), San
Miguel (ACTG, HPTN), and Via Libre (HVTN, HPTN). The specific areas of research proposed for the next grant
cycle have been chosen considering both the networks research priorities and our CRS strengths. In each area,
there is a track record of significant accomplishments and great potential for future contributions. The CTU aims
to: 1) evaluate individual and combination vaccine and non-vaccine HIV prevention interventions among men
who have sex with men and transgender women; 2) evaluate novel therapeutic interventions targeting HIV and
strategies to address toxicities, drug-drug interactions, and comorbidities; 3) improve the prevention and
treatment of tuberculosis; 4) maintain the highest standards of resource management for efficient and timely
implementation of clinical trials; and 5) continue building relationships and effective communications with the
Peruvian community and stakeholders promoting good participatory practices in clinical trials. These feasible
aims, our increasing capacity to conduct clinical trials and our ability to adapt to challenges, uniquely position
the PERU CTU to continue contributing towards an HIV/AIDS- and TB-free generation."

Genomic stability is very closely linked to diseases associated with aging, like neurodegeneration and cancer.
Interestingly, strong evidence suggests unexpected links between these two diseases, since epidemiological
studies have found that Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients are at an increased risk of developing melanoma.
Furthermore, this relationship is bidirectional; individuals diagnosed with melanoma are at an increased risk of
developing PD. Although these clinical associations are well-established, the cellular and molecular pathways
linking these diseases are poorly understood. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease
associated with a complex combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, which manifests into
devastating movement and coordination deficits. Its hallmark pathological finding is the presence of aggregated
forms of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) in the substantia nigra of patient brains. Recent studies have also found a
previously unrecognized role for αSyn in melanomagenesis and metastasis, highlighting the role of αSyn in
regions outside of the central nervous system. Several studies have shown that melanoma cells overexpress
αSyn and that this is important for promoting cell proliferation and growth; however, the underlying role of αSyn
within melanogenesis is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that αSyn is important in DNA double-
strand break (DSB) repair, and my new studies show an important role for αSyn within the nucleolus.
Furthermore, genomic instability within the nucleolus has been associated with several diseases linked to cellular
aging and has been shown to induce cellular senescence. Therefore, based on my preliminary data and these
published findings, I hypothesize that the upregulation of αSyn plays a critical role in cells to facilitate nucleolar
DSB repair, limit senescence, and thus contribute to overall cell survival. This hypothesis will be tested through
two aims: first, I will determine the role of αSyn in nucleolar DSB repair (Aim 1) and next, determine the role of
αSyn in cellular senescence inhibition and melanoma growth and metastatic potential (Aim 2). I will accomplish
these goals through both in vitro and in vivo methodology. Using a human melanoma cell line that highly
expresses αSyn, SK-Mel28, I will investigate the localization and function of αSyn in the nucleolus using various
imaging and proteomic techniques. I will knockout αSyn to investigate loss-of-function nucleolar phenotypes and
whether cellular senescence inhibition is altered. I will then reintroduce not only wildtype αSyn, but also four
neurodegeneration-associated variants. To test whether αSyn plays a role in melanoma growth and metastasis
through nucleolar DSB and senescence inhibition in vivo, I will breed an αSyn KO spontaneous melanoma
mouse model. Through histological examination I will determine whether αSyn loss-of-function impairs nucleolar
DSB repair and senescence inhibition, delays primary tumor growth, and diminishes metastasis. Achieving these
goals will have a profound impact on the aging field by introducing genomic instability and cellular senescence
concepts to our understanding of the cross-talk between PD and melanoma."

 Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is predominantly deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is a
top contributor to harm in hospitalized children. Critical illness and central venous catheter (CVC) are the most
important risk factors for VTE in children. Among critically ill children, the risk of CVC-associated DVT (CADVT)
is as high as 54% with 72% of cases in infants <1-year old. Given that VTE is generally preventable in adults
with pharmacologic prophylaxis, national initiatives are ongoing to prevent VTE in children. However, the
incidence of pediatric VTE has not decreased in 2 decades. Due to paucity of age-appropriate evidence on its
efficacy against CADVT, pharmacologic prophylaxis is uncommon in children. Extrapolation of evidence from
adults is not appropriate because the coagulation system changes significantly with age. We recently
completed a Bayesian phase 2b randomized clinical trial funded by NICHD. In this trial, we randomized
critically ill children to early administration of prophylactic dose of enoxaparin, the most commonly used
anticoagulant for prophylaxis, or usual care. Prophylaxis with enoxaparin appeared to reduce the risk of
CADVT by half. In post hoc analyses, the reduction was limited to older children ≥1-year old. The goal of the
proposed Catheter-Related Early Thromboprophylaxis with Enoxaparin (CRETE) Studies is to investigate this
newly identified age-dependent heterogeneity in the efficacy of enoxaparin in reducing the risk of CADVT in
critically ill children. To achieve this goal, we aim (1) to confirm the efficacy and safety of early administration of
prophylactic dose of enoxaparin in reducing the risk of CADVT in critically ill older children; (2) to determine the
efficacy and safety of early administration of therapeutic dose of enoxaparin in reducing the risk of CADVT in
critically ill infants; and, (3) to probe the mechanisms that underly the age-dependent heterogeneity in the
efficacy of enoxaparin in reducing the risk of CADVT in critically ill children. We will conduct 2 multicenter
Bayesian explanatory randomized clinical trials in parallel to address Specific Aims 1 and 2. Depending on
age, subjects will be randomized to different doses of enoxaparin vs usual care. Subjects will be systematically
assessed for the development of CADVT using ultrasonography and clinically for bleeding. Using plasma
obtained from subjects in the 2 trials, we will conduct an exploratory mechanistic nested case-control study to
address Specific Aim 3. Biomarkers of the different mechanisms underlying CVC-associated thrombus
formation, particularly thrombin generation, will be compared between subjects with and without CADVT. We
will use Bayesian methods to improve the efficiency in the conduct and analyses of these studies. The
proposed CRETE Studies address NICHD’s research priorities on child development, critical illness,
therapeutics and innovative clinical trial design. They will provide high-quality age-appropriate evidence that
will inform preventive strategies against CADVT and decrease harm in hospitalized children."
10746825,"Obesity prevalence in youth with spina bifida (SB) is reported as high as 74%, dramatically higher than their
typically developing (TD) peers at 16.9%. Obesity is associated with life-long medical, psychological and
economic burdens. In SB, obesity further limits one’s independence and ability to self-manage health as well
as places them at risk for secondary obesity-related comorbidities. Accurate measurement of body fat is critical
as higher levels are associated with increased health risks. Once body fat is established, knowledge of the
individual’s total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is essential to determine an individual’s recommended daily
caloric intake needed to maintain or change body weight. Successful identification, prevention and/or treatment
of obesity is severely compromised by the lack of: 1) a clinically feasible, cost-effective and valid method to
measure body fat, and 2) data on TDEE of youth with SB. Inherent characteristics of SB complicate the ability
to accurately measure height, to identify body fat and are associated with a decreased energy expenditure. In
addition, a Body Mass Index (BMI), commonly used in clinics as a surrogate estimate of body fat to screen for
obesity is inaccurate when used in SB. Proposals for alternative measures or methods to accurately identify
body fat in individuals with SB have been made, but have yet to be tested in a sufficiently large sample. To
address these gaps, we will develop two independent methods and/or algorithms for use in youth with SB, one
to model body fat in a clinic environment and one to predict TDEE in order to determine daily caloric intake
recommendations. This multisite, cross-sectional study will include 232 youth with SB, ages 5-18 (stratified by
age and mobility status). Sites include four pediatric SB programs from different geographical regions.
Participants will have four body composition measures (waist circumference, four-site skinfolds, bioelectrical
impedance analysis, and Doubly Labeled Water [DLW]) and up to five height measures (standing [if able to
stand independently], arm span, recumbent, knee height and ulnar length) performed. DLW analysis and
calculations will provide the criterion body fat%, fat-free mass and TDEE. The body composition and/or height
measures will be used to develop an algorithm that accurately models body fat% and categorizes weight status
of youth with SB. Based on the average TDEE, an algorithm will be developed to predict energy requirements
with a best-fit model based on fat-free mass, sex, age, ambulation status height and/or weight. In addition, a
nutrition and physical activity screener will be employed to describe the dietary intake and patterns of physical
activity in youth with SB. The proposed study aligns with the mission and research goals of NICHD by ensuring
that all children have the opportunity for healthy and productive lives by optimizing independence and
promoting the health of populations at an increased risk for obesity by generating findings to be used in the
creation and testing of weight management interventions."

The development of techniques to generate functional, perfused blood vessel networks is essential for
engineering of viable tissues as well as for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Pro-angiogenic growth factors
have been used, either as a standalone therapy or in combination with cell-based techniques, to promote
vascularization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for delivery of pro-angiogenic growth factors have
yielded disappointing results in clinical, therapeutic trials. This is because optimal growth factor combinations,
concentrations, release kinetics, and spatial presentations are unknown. Thus, there is a need to develop
translatable technologies for precisely controlling these parameters so optimization can be achieved. Our long-
term goal is to develop implantable biomaterials for tissue regeneration that are spatiotemporally manipulated
in a non-invasive, on-demand manner using focused ultrasound. Focused ultrasound is a clinically-used
technology with sub-millimeter precision that penetrates deeply within the body. During the prior funding
period, we developed a paradigm-changing hydrogel, termed an acoustically-responsive scaffold (ARS) that
enables the controlled release of multiple, pro-angiogenic growth factors using ultrasound. An ARS consists of
an ultrasound-sensitive emulsion embedded within a hydrogel matrix. Growth factors encapsulated within the
emulsion are released when an ARS is exposed to focused ultrasound. This non-thermal release mechanism,
termed acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV), is driven by the formation of a bubble within each emulsion
droplet, thereby releasing the encapsulated payload. We developed techniques to sequentially release basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) from an ARS. We also
demonstrated that ADV can release bioactive bFGF with high specificity, thereby leading to the formation of
functional vessels in vivo. The kinetics of bFGF release strikingly impacted the formation of perfused blood
vessels. ADV-generated bubbles also dramatically altered the permissiveness of the ARS to cell migration.
The objective of this proposal is to understand how vascularization is impacted by spatiotemporal variation of
release kinetics of bFGF and PDGF-BB from an ARS as well as permissiveness of the ARS. The central
hypothesis is that optimal blood vessel formation can be achieved by precisely controlling growth factor release
from ARSs using ADV-generated bubble dynamics. Aim 1 will use ADV-generated bubble dynamics to
modulate the kinetics of growth factor release from an ARS. Aim 2 will quantify the impact of bFGF release
kinetics and ARS permissiveness on the development and inosculation of cell-loaded ARSs. Aim 3 will
demonstrate enhanced vascularization in an atherosclerotic model of hind limb ischemia by sequentially
delivering bFGF and PDGF-BB from acellular ARSs. Successful completion of these aims will advance the
translation of pro-angiogenic growth factors in acellular and cell-based therapies for vascularization as well as
propel other biomedical applications of ADV."

Our general strategy is to take advantage of novel tools and methodologies that we have developed
during our first two CTD^2 funding periods– more specifically pioneering and applying CRISPR based
technologies to aid the discovery and characterization of novel cancer targets and their modulators–
using innovative high throughput technologies. Our end goal is to uncover optimal combinations of
targets with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity and
environmental context. This requires us to better understand tumor biogenesis, namely the
combinations of genes that drive oncogenesis, and tumor heterogeneity which complicates effective
therapeutic treatment.
In this proposal we build upon exciting systems allowing us to quantitate genotypic and phenotypic cell
heterogeneity in cell culture and in vivo. The overall goal is to identify synthetic gene combinations
necessary for clinical resistance and related to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We hypothesize
that altered cell states such as inflammatory phenotypes and lineage plasticity fuels therapy tolerance
and resistance. We apply single-cell approaches and cutting-edge lineage tracing tools to investigate
the genesis of pathogenic cellular state changes and use genetic screening, computational and
pharmacologic approaches, and clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumor models to identify
mechanistically calibrated, specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. These approaches will be applied to two
cancer, lung and breast adenocarcinoma.
Tumor biogenesis and evolution is a challenging area of research, largely due to the complexity of cell
types and behaviors and the combinations of genes that drive cancer types and subtypes is poorly
understood. We have developed next generation GEMMs to interrogate gene combinations that
promote cancer. In this aim, mouse models will be generated that contain combinations of genetic
perturbations of the top 30 TCGA recurrent mutations. These studies will associate the combination of
perturbagens with specific cell states, despite their clonal heterogeneity and cell state and lay a solid
foundation for identifying which combinations of recurrent genes respond to which therapy, thus
helping to stratify patients. This part of the research program focuses on lung cancer as it synergizes
with other components of the proposal. We apply an evolved lineage tracing technology with single
cell RNA-seq readout that lets us follow tumor evolution with unprecedented resolution. These studies
will help us understand how tumor plasticity enables cancers to evade therapeutic challenges. And
importantly, how the loss of tumor suppressor genes or gene combinations, alters the preferred
evolutionary paths a single transformed cell takes to reach aggressive and metastatic states."
10745999,"The PIs’ laboratories focus on the pathways leading to lipid uptake by tissues and their metabolic implications. We showed that the FA transporter, CD36, mediates uptake of VLDL- but not chylomicron (CM)-derived FAs and established in vivo that there are at least two pathways for FA uptake into tissues. We recently floxed the CD36 gene and created knockouts in multiple tissues. Most germane to this proposal, we showed that endothelial cell (EC) specific CD36 deletion reproduces many of the in vivo effects of global CD36 deletion including reduced long-chain FA uptake into muscle and adipose tissues. These findings documented importance of the endothelium in regulating tissue lipid uptake and together with novel preliminary data form the basis for the current application, which is focused on understanding how ECs function in uptake of non-esterified FAs and of FAs derived from CMs and VLDL. Our preliminary data show that exogenous FAs in complex with EC-CD36 and in conjunction with Caveolin 1 (Cav1) are internalized into vesicles and are released from ECs within exosome- like small extracellular vesicles or sEVs. In Aim 1 we will dissect the cellular events associated with the FA- CD36-Cav1 interaction and FA transcytosis by ECs and define the processes required for sEV secretion. In addition, we propose that at high FA levels, e.g. during CM lipolysis, a non-CD36 paracellular pathway of FA transfer is activated and we will determine the mechanisms that mediate FA-induced changes in EC junctions and barrier function. Other preliminary data show that ECs internalize and metabolize nascent CMs via a non- lipoprotein lipase and non-CD36 requiring process that appears to involve scavenger receptor-B1. In Aim 2 we will examine how EC delivery of FAs from CMs and VLDL differs. We will determine the molecular requirements for CM interaction with the EC surface, the cellular processes for internalization and whether CM lipids are transcytosed across ECs and released in EVs. The CM uptake pathway will be compared to that for VLDL where we will define the role of CD36. We will also examine how internalization of FAs, CMs, VLDL and EV products changes EC and macrophage biology. These studies will illustrate the pathways by which the body distributes calories between organs and will define basic processes that underlie the physiologic and pathological uptake and storage of lipids in tissues. Such information will suggest novel ways to disrupt the pathological consequences of excess calorie intake that occur with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes."

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising modality for restoring physiological functions
such as mobility, communication, and visual perception. The BRAIN Initiative is a key driver of BCIs, funding
development of prosthetics for movement disorders, communication devices, and cortical visual prosthetics
(CVPs). CVPs aim to restore some degree of sight or a functional analogue for people who are blind. Unlike
other methods of sight restoration, CVPs bypass damaged or dysfunctional ocular anatomy, aiming to provide
potentially life-altering benefits via a distinctive, brain-based approach. But while other brain implants, including
other BCIs, are widely studied and discussed by neuroethicists, CVPs have received little attention and there is
a lack of empirical data on stakeholder perspectives about CVPs. CVPs raise special considerations due to
conceptual questions about the role of blindness in identity, autonomy, quality of life, and other dimensions of
non-clinical risk and benefit. CVPs are a potential tool for empowering blind individuals, but the specialized nature
of the intervention raises issues of access, and it is also crucial that this research avoid unexpected group harms
to the blind community. Furthermore, the visual experience that CVP technology is likely to provide even in a
best-case scenario is quite different from typical vision. Thus, there is uncertainty about how to measure success
in CVP research. Responsible development of CVPs must take into consideration the perspectives of
researchers and participants on the issue of how to define restoration of function and determine degree of
improvement necessary to qualify as success. Aim 1 will determine how members of a CVP research team define
restoration of function and its ethical importance as a research goal by utilizing an embedded neuroethics
approach (ethnographic participant observation) with a lab conducting human subjects research on CVPs. Aim
2 will identify the values that guide and ought to guide current and future practice in the field from the perspective
of CVP researchers using in-depth qualitative interviews. Aim 3 will employ similar interviews to explore the
values that guide and ought to guide current and future practice in the field from the perspective of individuals
with experience as participants in CVP research. This project will help identify and address ethics and policy
dimensions of next-generation CVP systems, helping to maximize the individual and social benefits of the
research while minimizing its risks and providing values-based guidance for development of neurotechnologies
aiming to restore vision and other physiological functions."

Prostate cancer is a major US health concern with over 160,000 new cases and 30,000 deaths per year. More
than 90% of patients with advanced disease have bone metastases with a median survival of a year. Patients
with metastatic bone disease suffer from bone pain, fractures, hypercalcemia, cytopenias, and ultimately death.
The goal of this early phase “feasibility” imaging “biomarker-driven” trial is to investigate novel 3D hyperpolarized
(HP) 13C-pyruvate MRI techniques to quantitatively measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzed pyruvate-
to-lactate (kPL) conversion rates in prostate cancer bone metastases to enable early and rapid metabolic
response monitoring to treatment response and development of therapeutic resistance, as well assess on-target
treatment effects for new targeted drug development, thus addressing current unmet clinical needs. This clinical
trial is required because current imaging modalities for bone metastases are inadequate for quantifying response
to therapeutic interventions. This can result in significant delays in determining treatment effectiveness, and
subjecting patients to prolonged periods of side-effects of ineffective therapies, too often causing excess
morbidity without benefit.
Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C-pyruvate MRI is a safe, non-radioactive, quantitative MR stable-isotope imaging
approach that can provide early, real-time metabolic response monitoring of prostate cancer bone metastases.
Added to conventional mpMRI exams, the rapid 2 minute HP MRI measurement of pyruvate-to-lactate
conversion rate, kPL, a potentially valuable “biomarker”, reflects changes in metabolic reprogramming and early
response to targeted therapies (e.g. AR, MYC inhibitors). While PSMA-PET improves detection of metastatic
disease, PSMA expression is not directly affected by targeted therapies including androgen pathway inhibitors
and novel MYC-targeted therapies in clinical trial evaluation, and therefore is not able to reliably capture bone
metastasis response at early time points. HP 13C-pyruvate MR studies have demonstrated that MYC-mediated
increased HP 13C pyruvate-to-lactate metabolic conversion rate, kPL, is associated with key oncogenomic
alterations that occur with the progression to advanced prostate cancer and decreased in response to treatment.
Initial studies also demonstrated that higher kPL is associated with intrinsic resistance to androgen pathway
inhibitors (e.g. enzalutamide). Our multidisciplinary research team translated these findings into patient feasibility
studies and performed first-ever HP 13C-pyruvate metabolic MR imaging of patients with prostate cancer bone
metastases demonstrating feasibility and supporting the scientific rigor of this approach. This new biomarker-
driven trial is designed to apply new HP 13C-pyruvate MRI technology for monitoring androgen-receptor and MYC
targeted drug therapies with the goal of investigating kPL as a quantitative in vivo marker to measure metabolic
changes with treatment in patients with bone-tropic advanced prostate cancer."

Mutations in gene regulatory elements (REs) are a major cause of human disease. For example, the majority
(>90%) of disease related genome wide association studies (GWAS) found associations with variants in non-
coding and likely regulatory regions in the genome. Despite their importance, the code and grammar of these
regulatory elements remains largely unknown making the understanding of how mutations in these sequences
can lead to disease even more complex. Regulatory elements can be identified in a genome-wide manner
using techniques such as ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. However, these methods are descriptive and do not provide
a functional readout that tests whether these elements are indeed functional. Massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRAs) and CRISPR-based screens have recently been developed to functionally characterized
these elements in a high-throughput manner. However, most of these techniques use cultured cells to measure
activity. As such, the activity and function of these elements and their variants in an organism has not been
tested. Due to this, complex phenotypes, such as spatial-temporal, and tissue/cell type specificity and
interactions cannot be assessed for these elements. In this K99/R00 application, I will develop technologies
that will allow to functionally characterize regulatory elements and variants in a high throughput manner in
mice. One of the biggest barriers that prevent high-throughput assays in mice is the zona pellucida that
surrounds one-cell stage embryos and prevents double-stranded DNA to be inserted. Recent reports and my
own preliminary data show that by utilizing adeno associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) as a delivery tool, DNA
can integrate into one-cell stage embryos. I plan to use AAV6 along with the PiggyBac transposase system,
that allows for genomic integration in all three-germ layers, to develop MPRA in mice (Aim K1). To validate the
effect of single nucleotide variants, I will develop large-scale CRISPR saturation mutagenesis assays in mice.
This will be done by utilizing in vitro electroporation into embryos and base-editor or prime-editor transgenic
mice (Aim K2). Finally, I will apply these technologies to generate a catalog of functional regulatory elements,
including transposable elements, involved in differentiation of the three primary germ layers (Aim R1). The
results from this proposal will provide novel in vivo high-throughput technologies that will enable to study
regulatory elements and disease-associated variants at any developmental time stage in mice. My career goal
is to lead an independent research group developing novel functional genomics tools in mice and studying the
function of gene regulatory elements and their variants in tissue development and disease utilizing these
technologies. To achieve this goal, I will receive experimental and computational training from my mentors Drs.
Nadav Ahituv and Jay Shendure. This rigorous mentored support and results obtained in the K99 phase will
ensure my transition to an independent investigator and future successful independent career."
10679035,"Abstract:
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults. GBM patients'
response to therapies including surgical resection, radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, and tumor treating fields
(TTF) is unsatisfactory, leading to a high recurrence rate, which is considered fatal. Salvage RT is often used to
delay recurrent GBM tumor growth and prolong patient survival. However, due to the diffusive nature of the
GBM cells, a large isotropic treatment margin (~2cm) is added to cover microscopic disease beyond the
radiographically confirmed tumor on magnetic resonance image (MRI). Because of the considerable overlap
between the recurrent and primary planning target volumes (PTV), growth delay from the additional salvage
radiation dose allowed by the normal organ tolerance is modest. A more significant, more effective dose is toxic
to organs at risk (OARs), including the brain stem, chiasm, optic nerves, and involved brain parenchyma, etc. To
safely escalate the dose, the recurrent treatment volume must be significantly reduced. Compared with the
radiologically confirmed tumor with added non-specific margin, the volume of the subclinical recurrence at an
earlier time point is markedly smaller. Our preliminary research based on the role of stem cell niches (SCN's) in
GBM cell migration shows the feasibility of voxel-wise prediction of GBM recurrences 2-3 months before they
become radiographically apparent. The prediction of the GBM recurrence (TIME) algorithm was
developed through training a machine learning classifier on longitudinal multi-parametric follow-up MR
images, quantifying the potential connection between the recurrence and SCN's in the brain. Given the promising
results, it is necessary to further improve the algorithm for more accurate prediction and establish its impact on
radiotherapy treatment planning before an interventional clinical trial. The following aims are proposed to
achieve the goal. Aim 1: Develop a neural network weakly supervised by stem cell niche locations to perform
voxel-level recurrence prediction. Aim 2a: Prospective patient image data acquisition, pre-processing, and
voxel-wise recurrence prediction model validation. Aim 2b: Demonstrate that significant dose escalation can be
achieved for early predicted recurrence. The project's success will further elucidate SCN's involvement in GBM,
provide a way to early predict recurrence, and help improve the targeting accuracy and efficacy of salvage
radiotherapy. The last point will pave a path towards a prospective interventional trial that can be practice-
changing for GBM management."

A major goal of neuroscience research is to understand how experience reweights the flow of information
across brain circuits. This involves plasticity that occurs at across different regions of neurons (i.e., subcellular
compartmentalization). Our preliminary data revealed compartmentalization of signaling within neurons that
encode olfactory memories, and further found that learning drives spatially broad elevations of Ca2+. This
suggests that multiple signals are integrated across different spatial scales during learning events to modulate
compartmentalized plasticity. Here we will test how compartmentalized plasticity drives the ensembles of
changes across multiple spatial scales in the nervous system that leads to coherent action selection.
We will test the mechanisms of compartmentalized presynaptic plasticity down to the subcellular level, using
the genetically powerful, highly tractable nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila
mushroom body (MB) carries olfactory information from olfactory projection neurons to downstream circuits
that mediate fundamental decision-making processes. We will use this system as a testbed to dissect the
mechanisms of compartmentalized plasticity at the molecular levels, examine cellular integration and synaptic
plasticity, and probe how these processes modulate behavioral action selection via actions on discrete circuits
that modulate behavior.
Understanding how memories are encoded in the brain and disrupted in brain disorders is a prerequisite to the
rational design of treatments for memory impairment. Results of the present studies will provide guideposts for
future research into the molecular biology of memory formation across multiple model organisms (including
mammals), as the function of key molecules, cellular mechanisms, cellular compartmentalization and synaptic
function, circuit motifs, and computational primitives are both conserved across species and crucial across
multiple circuits & types of memory. The project will support our long-term goal of understanding of memory
down to the single-cell level, contributing to the knowledge base necessary for the rational development of
novel treatments for memory impairment."
11135098,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Binge-eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are potentially life-threatening eating disorders that
share behavioral and brain similarities, genetic risk factors and higher-than-expected comorbidities with drug
addiction – suggesting a common etiology. However, no mechanistic study has examined this possibility due in
part to the lack of an animal model linking eating disorders and drug addiction. Like drug craving and use in
drug addiction, food craving and eating in BED/BN persist despite adverse consequences (punishment). Our
finding from rats indicates that extensive cocaine and alcohol histories, known to trigger addiction-like brain
changes and punishment-resistant “compulsive” drug intake in rats, trigger punishment-resistant food intake or
“compulsive appetite”. These results provide an animal model for studying the neurobiological mechanisms
manifesting as compulsive behavior across eating disorders and drug addiction. Food motivation is thought to
be regulated by both homeostatic (caloric) and non-homeostatic (hedonic/incentive) systems. The homeostatic
system detects energy shortages and elicits food intake. However, like compulsive drug motivation, our finding
suggests that compulsive appetite is driven by non-homeostatic ‘motivational/habitual’ dysregulation. Like
cocaine and alcohol histories, obesogenic diet histories also led to compulsive appetite via non-homeostatic
dysregulation. Thus, similarly common – rather than history-specific – changes in brain sites that control non-
homeostatic regulation, such as reward circuits, likely cause compulsive appetite. Our collaborator Dr. Jhou’s
group has found that punishments suppress appetitive behavior by recruiting neurons in the rostromedial
tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which in turn inhibits reward circuits. Available evidence indicates that extensive
drug histories [1] degrade excitatory afferents to RMTg, [2] decrease punishment-reactivity of RMTg neurons
and [3] impair inhibitory control of RMTg efferents on reward circuits. Such brain changes would entail “less
brakes” on non-homeostatic regulation, potentially manifesting as compulsive appetite. Accordingly, like
extensive cocaine/alcohol/obesogenic diet histories, [4] RMTg inactivation results in punishment-resistant
compulsive appetite. Based on the rigor of previous research and premise above, this project will test the
central hypothesis that extensive cocaine/alcohol/obesogenic diet histories result in punishment-resistant
compulsive appetite via decreased neural punishment-reactivity in the RMTg circuitry. RMTg contains neurons
selectively reactive to punishments or rewards – likely exerting distinct behavioral functions. Each Aim is thus
designed to selectively profile and interrogate punishment-reactive RMTg neurons/afferents/efferents (as Aims
1/2/3) using neural activity-specific methods based on the activation marker Fos. The results will reveal neural
activity network reorganizations that are functionally linked to compulsive appetite – an overlapping ramification
of extensive drug and obesogenic diet histories. Our hope is that such knowledge will help identify common
therapeutic targets for compulsive behavior across drug addiction and eating disorders."
10932860,"Project Summary/Abstract: The goal of this BAATAAR-UP renewal program application within the NCI ARTNet
is to characterize the mechanisms of, and therapeutically counteract, acquired resistance to molecular therapies
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by delineating the tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) ecosystem and
its plasticity during treatment. Acquired resistance is defined as tumor progression that occurs during therapy
and after an initial tumor response. The overarching hypothesis is that acquired resistance to molecular therapies
can be thwarted by defining and exploiting vulnerabilities in the cellular, signaling, and geographic tumor
ecosystem networks that allow tumors to survive and grow during therapy. In lung cancer and other cancer types,
the use of targeted therapies that inhibit important and common oncogenic driver alterations such as mutant
EGFR and KRAS (G12C) and block immunosuppressive checkpoints such as PD1/PDL1 is improving patient
outcomes. A major challenge to transforming cancers into chronic or curable diseases is acquired resistance,
which enables lethal cancer progression in patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired
resistance is essential to develop counteracting strategies that improve patient survival. During the prior NCI
U54 DRSC funding period, our team uncovered several mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapy
in human NSCLC by studying clinical specimens and innovative patient-derived models including humanized
murine models bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) with an intact
TME. Our expert team proposes to investigate these mechanisms, and identify others, synergistically and
iteratively via 3 Research Projects and optimal interactions with 2 Cores. A Data Science Core will analyze,
harmonize, centralize, and share data obtained across the basic and translational continuum using innovative
methods. An Administrative Core will ensure optimal project integration and internal and external interactions
with the ARTNet Consortium, and scientific and lay communities. Project 1 (Clinical tumor-TME acquired
resistance) is translational and uses clinical specimens and patient-derived models to test the hypothesis that
tumor macrophages and tumor fibroblasts promote acquired resistance via paracrine signaling interactions
including cytokine, CD47, and extracellular matrix (ECM) cues sensed by cancer cells and converging on survival
pathways such as YAP and NF-kB. Project 2 (PDX tumor-TME acquired resistance) is translational and uses
humanized mouse models to test the hypothesis that an immune-suppressive TME and activation of macrophage
and fibroblast signaling circuits that support tumor cell survival via PDK1, YAP, and NF-kB signaling promote
acquired resistance. Project 3 (PDO tumor-TME acquired resistance) is basic and uses synthetic lethal and
proteomic profiling in PDOs with a TME to test the hypothesis that signaling interactions involving the ECM,
TROP2, and CD47 promote acquired resistance. Synergistic, iterative interactions to study these mechanisms
across projects and systems will yield robust, translatable treatment strategies to counteract acquired resistance."
10669241,"Adoptive cellular therapy and therapeutic cancer vaccines have shown promise in solid tumor malignancies but
responses have generally been modest. By combining these two modalities in a rationally designed first-in-
human study, we propose to treat patients with a highly-defined T cell product (comprised of PRAME-specific
memory T cells) in combination with an antigen- specific vaccine (comprised of a curated cocktail of synthetic
long peptides) to augment and sustain the in vivo persistence of transferred PRAME-specific T cells. Addition
of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, (anti-CTLA4), further favorably modulates the tumor environment by
enabling un-fettered CD28 engagement of B7 (to expand the in vivo population of CD28-hi PRAME-specific
memory T cells), lowering the threshold of activation of endogenous tumor-reactive T cells (facilitating antigen-
spreading), and modulating inhibitory activity (by engaging CTLA4+ regulatory cells). This study, as proof of
concept for this triple T cell-based strategy, will be used to address a critical unmet need for patients with
metastatic uveal melanoma, and establish a versatile platform for targeting a broader range of tumor antigens
and tumor types. In this study, all 3 modalities (PRAME vaccine, ETC therapy and anti-CTLA), are reduced to
clinical practice and by using a highly-defined antigen-specific T cell population for adoptive therapy, allows for
rigorous immunologic analysis so that reasons for success or failure can be elucidated.
In an effort to enhance efficacy as well as broaden this approach to benefit a larger pool of patients, PRAME
epitopes presented by additional HLA Class I and II alleles will be identified. The results of the proposed
studies may lead to formal Phase II trials to assess true efficacy, development of a new treatment standard for
refractory metastatic uveal melanoma, and refinement of CD4 T cell and combined CD4 and CD8 T cell
strategies that can be incorporated into future clinical studies.
This proposal leverages the clinically-tested expertise in therapeutic cancer vaccines at ISA Pharma and the
pioneering development of ETC therapy in the Yee Lab to explore an opportunity that is timely and ideally
suited for an academic – industrial partnership."
10748356,"Ensuring that the biomedical research workforce is exceptional requires that the best scientific minds from all parts of society choose to participate. This is especially important for neuroscience, as major challenges remain for developing effective strategies to treat neurological disorders. Most individuals are exposed to neuroscience as a field of study late in the career decision process. This can be problematic as rigorous research experience is necessary to commit to a career investigating neurological disease. The Explorations in Neuroscience Research for High School Students program was initiated to fill this gap. Trained mentors will supervise high school students as they work for seven weeks on substantive research projects in neuroscience, neurological injury, or neurodegeneration. Experienced faculty will provide complementary workshops to promote professional development and prepare individuals for neuroscience research experience in college and beyond. Participants will be selected from the Columbus metropolitan area and include individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in neuroscience research. We will track the impact of the program on cognitive factors known to promote choice and persistence in research activities. We will also track participants’ career trajectories after the program to discern the long-term effects of this seven- week experience and its impact on the biomedical neuroscience research workforce. It is expected that this program will encourage participants to explore degrees in neuroscience, excel in high quality neuroscience research experiences, and promote development of a strong cohort of diverse young investigators dedicated to neurological disease research."
11129097,"Imaging early development of human neural circuits
The overall objective of this research is to create new imaging technology that dramatically improves our
ability to analyze the development of brain function and functional networks before birth. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique capability to study neural circuits and brain
functional connections in-vivo. Fetal fMRI acquisition and analysis, however, has been hampered by
three important challenges: 1) fetal motion disrupts the spatial and temporal continuity of the MRI signal,
2) geometric distortion is exacerbated by the motion of fetal and maternal organs, and 3) the anatomy
and function of the developing fetal brain is distinctly different from those of young children and adults,
thus current processing pipelines and atlases are inadequate for reliable fetal fMRI analysis. To address
these challenges, we pursue three specific aims in this study, that are focused on 1) developing a
prospectively motion navigated fetal fMRI acquisition technology, based on fast real-time image
processing, that compensates for the fetal head motion and geometric distortions during acquisitions; 2)
developing a post-acquisition processing technique that reconstructs an fMRI time series from motion-
corrected fetal fMRI data that are scattered in space and time because of motion and motion correction;
and 3) assessing the utility of fetal fMRI and the developed technologies to evaluate early development
of neural circuits and brain function in fetuses with congenital heart disease compared to healthy fetuses.
This contribution is important because it 1) mitigates a critical barrier to making progress in the field of
developmental neurology and neuroscience by allowing reliable use of fetal fMRI in studying normal vs.
abnormal development of the brain function; 2) improves the efficiency and efficacy of fetal fMRI through
prospectively adjusting scans to compensate for motion and geometric distortions, thus strengthens our
ability to study large cohorts; 3) provides tools and resources, including atlas-based parcellation and a
processing pipeline for the analysis of fetal fMRI; and 4) generates important knowledge about the
origins of disrupted neural development due to hypoxia ischemia in congenital heart disease. The
technology, resources, and knowledge developed in this study have a broad impact and are crucial for
advanced studies in developmental neuroscience and neurology, aiming to elucidate the potentially
devastating effects of adverse early life conditions including congenital disorders of the brain and heart. It
is hoped that these studies lead to improved understanding of the underlying causes of
neurodevelopmental disorders, leading to preventive strategies, therapies, and in some cases, cure."

The “YES Oklahoma” program provides a pathway that sustains an enhanced representation of Oklahoma
American Indian students in cancer research. Our program is supported by the Tribal President of the Wichita
and Affiliated Tribes, the Kiowa Tribe Higher Education, and the Chairman of the Comanche Nation, as well as
superintendents representing our partnering schools. Our institutional support is substantial, including >$70,000
annually and over 20 faculty mentors. Native American (NA) professionals are underrepresented in STEM fields,
particularly those in biomedical research, and near-absent in cancer research. This STEM discrepancy has
realized impacts on community health. There is a substantial NA health disparity in cancer occurrence and
mortality rates of various cancers, and much of these disparities occur with cancer types where regular
screening, early detection, and access to healthcare have a large impact. Compared to the general population,
where there has been considerable advancement over the last 20 years in lowering cancer-associated mortality,
such reductions have not been observed for NA groups. This suggests that a more robust NA healthcare
workforce and infrastructure, one with strong ties to their communities, could reduce these rates. In our aims,
we propose a research training strategy, where NA high school students interested in biomedical careers can
engage in hands on scientific research and professionalization activities, with a strong emphasis in cancer
research. YES Oklahoma Scholars will include a cohort of rising high school NA juniors and seniors engaged in
an 8-week summer course on professional development and cancer research (Aim 1); YES Oklahoma Teachers
(Aim 2) will include a cohort of middle and high school teachers from partner schools who will participate in an
8-week summer training event that includes research and curriculum development. Teachers will recruit future
YES Oklahoma Scholars from their classroom populations. This classroom cohort are the YES Oklahoma
Trainees, who engage is a Teacher’s YES Oklahoma curriculum that includes laboratory research experiences
and local YES Oklahoma outreach activities. Together, the PIs, Scholars, Teachers, and Trainees, along with
community stakeholders and tribes, will form our YES Oklahoma Outreach Team, and they will participate in
events focused on families, communities, and intertribal activities and cancer prevention education (Aim 3). The
YES Oklahoma program will directly impact over 76 participants (72 NA students and 4 teachers) annually, and
the combined outreach events will indirectly impact thousands of underserved students, teachers, families and
community members. The net result is that the program would have established a pathway of NA students
entering the STEM program and ultimately into biomedical sciences."
10747380,"We have identified a role for mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) in central regulation of feeding, energy- and glucose metabolism. We showed that mitochondrial fission is important for proper promotion of feeding and body weight gain by hypothalamic AgRP neurons, while mitochondrial fusion is critical for hypothalamic POMC neurons to support satiety and related adjustment of systemic glucose metabolism. In our preliminary studies we also found that interference with mitochondrial dynamics selectively in adult adipocytes has a robust impact on systemic metabolism, in which knockdown of the mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), resulted in rapid weight gain and elevated feeding of mice with concomitant elevations in hypothalamic transcripts for AgRP. These observations indicate weight gain is supported both centrally and peripherally by mitochondrial fission, and, that mitochondrial dynamics in either of the hypothalamus or adipocytes reciprocally impacts mitochondrial function in these tissues to affect behavior and systemic energy and glucose metabolism. In support of this, we revealed in an in vitro system that elevated fatty acid levels, which are critical for weight gain do promote mitochondrial fission. We observed that different fatty acids species have different effects on mitochondrial dynamics, and that altering dietary fat composition alone results in elevated in food intake and body weight gain. Taken together our observations gave impetus to the central hypothesis of this grant proposal that mitochondrial fission is a key dietary-influenced mechanism both in the hypothalamus and adipocytes that regulates body weight and adiposity. We propose the following Specific Aims to test our hypothesis: Specific aim 1 will assess the role of mitochondrial dynamics in food intake and energy expenditure by assessing the effects of both altered mitochondrial fission and fusion in mature adipocytes and in central feeding circuitry neurons. In addition, aim 1 will explore the afferent signaling from adipocytes that impacts the function of feeding circuitry neurons. Specific Aim 2 will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to establish the role of hypothalamic and adipocyte mitochondrial dynamics on dietary fat-influenced food intake."
10748309,"Metformin is the most prescribed first-line anti-diabetic drug. It has been widely accepted that metformin
lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver, and to a lesser extent by increasing
peripheral glucose uptake. However, exactly how metformin can do so remains controversial and debated.
The brain has (re)emerged as an important regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. The central nervous
system (CNS) is known to regulate glucose output and glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues, thereby
changing whole-body glucose balance. We previously found that the small GTPase Rap1 in the brain or in the
hypothalamus strongly influences glucose balance without affecting energy balance. Remarkably, we
have further revealed that forebrain-specific Rap1 deficient mice are selectively resistant to metformin's
glucose-lowering action, but retain sensitivity to other classes of anti-diabetic drugs. This preliminary
discovery suggests a previously completely unrecognized CNS process potentially accounting for the anti-
diabetic mechanism of metformin. To elucidate the neural mechanisms by which metformin lowers blood
glucose, we will test the hypothesis that metformin acts centrally to lower hyperglycemia via inhibition of Rap1
in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), a well-established site for glycemic control. This hypothesis
is formulated on the basis of our exciting, solid preliminary data through genetic, anatomical, pharmacological
and electrophysiology studies, which are for the first time presented here. The following three Specific Aims
will be addressed to test our hypothesis: 1) using state-of-the-art in vivo methodologies such as euglycemic
clamp and stable-isotope tracer techniques, we will investigate exactly how metformin in the brain
regulates systemic glucose metabolism, 2) using in vivo GCaMP and chemogenetic tools, we will
establish the importance of VMH SF1 neurons for the therapeutic action of metformin; and 3)
experiments in Aim 3 will use loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies to conclusively determine the role
of Rap1 in the VMH for metformin's anti-diabetic action. Together, these Aims will uncover an entirely novel
site(s) and molecular mechanism(s) of action of metformin. This proposal will uncover a long-speculated
mechanism explaining how metformin exerts its anti-diabetic actions by establishing a previously unknown
connection between metformin, the brain (VMH) and the small GTPase Rap1. Lastly, the outcomes are thus
likely to open a new area of pathophysiological and therapeutic discovery of type 2 diabetes."
10877967,"The autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), Graves’ disease (GD) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), are the most common autoimmune diseases. Because their mechanisms are not fully understood, AITD are treated symptomatically (hormone replacement in HT or hormone suppression in GD) and as a result, patients are often difficult to manage. Therefore, new therapies are needed that target the autoimmune mechanisms causing AITD. AITD are complex diseases caused by interactions between susceptibility genes and environmental triggers. We and others have mapped & confirmed several AITD genes, including thyroglobulin (Tg). We have also shown that interferon alpha (IFNα), produced during viral infections, is the key cytokine triggering AITD. The current proposal aims to dissect the genetic and environmental mechanisms causing AITD in order to target them with novel therapies. Our focus is on genetic mechanisms predisposing to AITD (Aim 1), environmental triggers of AITD (Aim 2), and medication triggers of AITD (Aim 3). In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that missense SNPs in Tg that are associated with AITD predispose to AITD by increasing Tg misfolding and enhancing its degradation into immunogenic peptides. We will use a novel muse model of AITD developed by us, in which autoimmune thyroiditis is induced by immunization with human Tg cDNA in a non-replicating Adenovirus vector. This model enables us to test the effects of different Tg SNPs shown to be susceptible or protective for AITD, and to assess in vivo mechanisms by which these Tg variants trigger AITD. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that IFNα triggers AITD by engaging the autophagic degradation of Tg into immunogenic peptides. We will use cell lines and a mouse model with thyroid over-expression of IFNα to define the autophagy-lysosomal pathways of Tg degradation; we will also test the immunogenicity of the generated Tg peptides in mouse models and PBMC’s from AITD patients. This aim will define a new unifying mechanism for triggering autoimmunity by IFNα-mediated autoantigen degradation. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on thyrocytes has intrinsic activity protecting them from intracellular stress during inflammation, and that Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI’s) trigger thyroiditis by blocking these intrinsic protective effects of PD-L1. We will use a new mouse model of ICI-thyroiditis we developed to dissect the mechanisms by which PD-L1 blockade triggers thyroiditis in vivo. This aim will define the mechanisms of ICI-induced thyroiditis as well as the role of thyroidal PD-L1 in AITD. Collectively, the studies in this proposal will help advance our long-term goal, to design targeted mechanism-based therapies for autoimmune thyroid diseases."

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) has evolved substantially from a catalog of rat genetic markers, maps, and
genes to a comprehensive resource with multiple genomic data types, extensive disease and phenotype
annotations, and tools to effectively mine, analyze and visualize the available data. The goal of RGD is to enable
investigators in their hypothesis-driven research. Leveraging its robust and flexible infrastructure, RGD has
added data from human and other important human disease model organisms to enhance its translational
aspect. RGD is also one of the founding members of the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance), a consortium
of the major model organism databases focused on harmonizing and presenting cross-species information.
Since 2019, there has been an exciting reinvigoration in the rat genomics community and research. Through
collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a new and vastly improved rat reference genome (mRatBN7.2)
has been generated and released, and RGD joined the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) to curate it.
Several complementary NIH-funded projects focused on generating whole genome, transcriptome, and
epigenome sequencing datasets are underway in numerous rat strains representing human disease models;
several strains, including key models of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders will have strain-specific, muli-omic
data and de novo genome assemblies. RGD has the unique opportunity to be the center of data integration for
these new, unique datasets, the overall theme of this renewal. To continue increasing the value of RGD and
build on the investments made by the NIH and other international funding bodies in rat research, we will develop
an extensive ecosystem for integration of multi-omics and biological data in the rat as a model of common human
complex disease and create a comprehensive comparative species platform to predict precision preclinical
human disease models for further study by research community."
10833692,"Schizophrenia (Sz) is a debilitating major mental illness with life-long disability that disproportionately burdens the
healthcare system and society. Despite decades of research, the underlying mechanisms of pathophysiology in
Sz are unknown. Attempts for determining brain abnormalities in Sz have gone beyond searching for one to a few
lesion locations to focusing on functional (dys)connectivity between systems-level brain circuits and the associated
neural events that underlie the failure in functional integration of information across distributed circuits. Effective
connectivity refers to the influence of activity in one area on activity in another at a later time, allowing inferences
about directionality. Our overarching hypothesis is that long-range cortical effective connectivity is a fundamental
biological system abnormality in schizophrenia, particularly between prefrontal cortex and sensory areas. This
proposal comprises a systems-level examination of structure, function, and connectivity in a distributed system
known to be impaired in Sz, the temporal lobe auditory cortices and the inferior frontal gyrus auditory-executive
cortex involved in the generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), an index of automatic auditory change detection.
We will examine effective connectivity between nodes of this distributed system, and use computational modeling
to translate neurophysiological information from EEG & MEG to synaptic conductances, indicating possible
molecular mechanisms of the systems-level deficits. Central to our approach is testing of individuals at their first
clinical contact for schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis (first episode schizophrenia-spectrum, FESz), where the
progressive primary and secondary disease effects on brain structure and function are minimized. Pathophysiology
proximal to disease onset very likely reflects processes critical to disease etiology. In FESz, we test 3 auditory
tests of increasing pattern complexity to differentially tax the auditory change detection system, measure brain
activity with combined high-temporal resolution EEG & MEG measures of neurophysiology, and construct
high-spatial resolution measures of brain structure to project sensor activity to cortical sources, compared and
contrasted between FESz and well individuals (AIM 1). Using advanced measures of spectral effective connectivity
(phase transfer entropy) on the source-resolved activity, we will determine dysconnectivity between the frontal and
temporal cortical sources in FESz on these tasks (AIM 2). Next, using computational modeling of a laminar cortical
circuit to replace single equivalent dipoles at each source, we will determine synaptic conductance deficits in
AMPA, GABA, and NMDA activity that may underlie the dysconnectivity in FESz (AIM 3). Finally, to assess
changes in brain structure, function, and connectivity after the onset of psychosis, we will test participants
longitudinally 6 months later to track progressive impairments (AIM 4). We believe studying the interactions
between bottom-up and top-down cortical processes shows great promise for understanding the basic molecular
mechanisms of predictive coding, learning, memory, attention, and other key brain functions that seem to be
compromised by Sz."
10747320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Canonical transient receptor potential-6 (TRPC6) channels drive certain familial forms of focal and segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and there is evidence that they contribute to much more common acquired forms
of FSGS and to renal fibrosis. TRPC6 dysregulation in podocytes occurs in animal models of FSGS, and in
podocytes exposed to serum or plasma from patients with recurrent FSGS, or in cells treated with the soluble
urokinase receptor (suPAR). While it is known that TRPC6 activation is required for Ca2+ influx driven by e.g.
angiotensin II, the Ca2+-permeability of TRPC6 is quite limited, and there are many conditions in which TRPC6
functions primarily as a monovalent cation channel. This fundamental property of TRPC6 suggests that while
it is necessary, it may not be sufficient to drive Ca2+ overload in podocytes or other cells. Specific Aim 1 of
this proposal tests the hypothesis that TRPC6 is part of a multichannel complex that includes KCa1.1
channels, and that coordinated KCa1.1 activation is necessary for TRPC6 to drive significant Ca2+ influx into
podocytes. KCa1.1 is a Ca2+-activated K+ channel that interacts with TRPC6 and other slit diaphragm proteins
including nephrin, Neph1, and podocin. Preliminary data show that KCa1.1 activation in podocytes is coupled
to TRPC6, and that KCa1.1 is dysregulated in an animal model of FSGS and in response to recurrent FSGS
plasma samples or suPAR. Specific Aim 1 will characterize changes in KCa1.1 gating and current density in
glomerular disease models previously shown to alter TRPC6. Quantitative Ca2+ imaging will address if KCa1.1
or its auxiliary β- and γ-subunits facilitate TRPC6-dependent Ca2+ influx into podocytes, which drives normal
cell signaling as well as pathological Ca2+ overload. There is now extensive evidence that suPAR contributes
to progression of multiple kidney diseases, including some cases of primary FSGS, but the mechanisms of
its signaling pathways are not well understood. Preliminary data show that the receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts (RAGE) functions as an essential co-receptor for suPAR on the pathway leading to Rac1,
oxidative stress, c-Src, and dysregulation of podocyte TRPC6. Specific Aim 2 will examine the role of RAGE
in driving albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in a mouse model (suPAR2-Tg) that overexpresses a suPAR
variant in adipocytes and secretes it into the circulation. These mice exhibit albuminuria that later progresses
to glomerulosclerosis in a manner similar to human FSGS. In Specific Aim 2 we will cross suPAR2-Tg mice
with mice homozygous for an inducible knockout of RAGE. We will induce RAGE knockout both prior to and
after the onset of albuminuria. We will also determine if two different small molecule RAGE antagonists reduce
albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in suPAR2-Tg mice. One of these antagonists, azeliragon, is orally
bioavailable in mice and humans, and is currently undergoing a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in a subset of patients
with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, a positive result in Specific Aim 2 could have considerable translational
significance for primary and recurrent FSGS, which in many patients is refractory to current treatments."
10745978,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The mononuclear phagocyte (MP) system plays a fundamental role in both innate and adaptive
immunity. It includes three broad classes of MPs extensively characterized in the mouse: (1) macrophages,
including alveolar macrophages, Langerhans cells, and three distinct subtypes of interstitial macrophages; (2)
tissue-trafficking monocytes; and (3) dendritic cells (DCs), which fall into two main types (DC1 and DC2),
though DC2 can be further subdivided. All these MPs, except AMs and LCs, which are unique to lung and skin,
reside in multiple organs, including the heart, skin, liver, and gut. MP subtypes demonstrate a clear division of
labor during innate and adaptive immunity with little to virtually no functional redundancy, which means that
specific interactions among them are crucial for optimal immune responses against viral, bacterial, and fungal
infections. Currently, however, multiple fundamental gaps for the identification and understanding of how these
MPs function in human organs limit our ability to develop prevention and treatment strategies across diseases.
 This project will investigate cross-species and cross-tissue homologies at the cellular, gene expression
and functional levels. We will obtain fresh human and mouse tissue from multiple organs (lung, skin, and their
draining lymph nodes), and employ three broad approaches. First, we will use both bulk RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify cross-species and cross-tissue homology.
RNA-seq provides sequencing depth (i.e., whole-transcriptome coverage), and scRNA-seq provides the ability
to confirm bulk homologous MP subtypes and examine the heterogeneity within previously defined MP
subtypes. Thus, bioinformatics analyses will identify clusters of homologous MP cell types and align them
across species. Second, for each cluster identified, we will identify genes conserved across species and
tissues, and those that are unique to a given homologous MP subtype, termed marker genes. The results of
these analyses will provide specific genetic markers for human MP subtypes and genetic treatment targets.
Broadly speaking, there are two categories of key marker genes we will functionally investigate: those
conserved in human-mouse MP counterparts that (1) have been well-defined in mice, but not previously
investigated in their human counterparts; and (2) not well-defined or extensively studied in either species.
Third, we will undertake a rigorous functional validation of the key genes identified in human-mouse MP
counterparts. This includes (a) in-vivo murine models with selective depletion of specific genes using
transgenic and conditional knockout (KO) mice; (b) in vitro model systems for human MPs, including assays for
antigen acquisition and processing, cellular interactions, and induction of adaptive immune responses; and (c)
create time-lapse videos with cellular-level microscopy for functional and morphological characterization."
10741815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are activated by extracellular ligands to transduce the bulk of the signals that
control cellular growth, proliferation and survival. The canonical model of RTK activation defines the role of
ligands as dimerizing agents that bring receptors into close proximity to activate the intracellular kinase domains.
However, many RTKs form dimers in the absence of ligands and their activation is dependent on the proper
association of domains on both sides of the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms governing such
allosteric effects remain unknown due to the lack of full-length receptor structures. The main goal of this proposal
is to understand how these mechanisms operate in the family of human epidermal growth factor (EGFR/HER)
receptors by obtaining their high-resolution full-length structures. HERs are unique RTKs because in contrast to
other RTKs, their kinase domains are not activated by trans-phosphorylation but by the formation of an
asymmetric kinase dimer in which one kinase domain becomes an allosteric activator of another. Through
structural work on portions of these receptors, we and others have shown that the asymmetric kinase domain
module of HER kinases is coupled to conformation of the adjacent juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains,
and those in turn are affected by the orientation of the extracellular domain modules. These relative structures
are additionally modulated by different HER receptor ligands which have been shown to elicit different biological
outcomes. How all these elements come together at the cell membrane is unknown. The inability to purify stable
complexes of HER receptors has impeded full-length structural studies. We have now developed a robust system
for expressing and purifying recombinant, nearly full-length HER receptors and routinely collect negative stain
EM (NS-EM) and cryo-EM data sets on these samples. Using this pipeline, we will focus on obtaining high
resolution structures of full length HER receptors in their inactive and ligand-bound active states. We will focus
on three members of the HER receptor family: HER2, HER3 and HER4 which engage in a range of heterodimeric
complexes in response to a spectrum of ligands. We hypothesize that the combinatorial power of receptor
interactions starts at the level of active complex formation. Using cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, enzymatic
measurements and cell-based testing of structurally-derived models, we will focus on answering the following
questions: 1. How do ligand-induced conformational changes propagate in the receptor across the plasma
membrane? 2. What are the differences in mechanism between different receptor heterodimers? 3. How is the
mechanism of activation fine-tuned by different ligands and by disease mutations? While our studies will be
focused on HER receptors, the developed innovative experimental approaches will be applicable to the entire
RTK family and other single-pass proteins, thus paving the way for many future discoveries. The biological
knowledge we will acquire in the process will also contribute to the development of innovative therapeutics that
target selected HER receptor complexes in human diseases."

 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), which is treatment given before surgery, has become a standard-of-care
for breast cancer patients diagnosed with locally advanced disease. NAC offers a unique opportunity for real-
time monitoring of tumor response and evaluation of drug efficacy. Patients who achieve pathologic complete
response (pCR) have an excellent outcome. Thus, the challenge of NAC is to bring each patient to pCR; and,
among non-responders, to identify those with a high probability of recurring for additional therapy in the adjuvant
setting. Biomarkers that accurately predict NAC response and metastatic recurrence are key to achieving these
objectives.
 We hypothesize that a multimodal approach for monitoring of tumor burden during NAC—i.e., by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based functional tumor volume (FTV) and liquid biopsy-based circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) analyses—can yield robust and accurate predictors of response to NAC and metastatic recurrence; and
in turn, aid in therapeutic decisions regarding escalation or de-escalation of treatment to improve patient
outcomes. Here, we propose a correlative study to the neoadjuvant I-SPY 2 TRIAL, a multicenter, adaptive
randomization phase II trial that evaluates the efficacy of novel therapies in combination with standard NAC.
Integrated within I-SPY 2, is an ongoing study that evaluates MRI FTV as predictor of response and outcome,
and an infrastructure for discovery and validation of companion diagnostic markers, including ctDNA.
 The proposed study aims to: (1) perform serial ctDNA profiling in patients receiving NAC; (2) combine serial
ctDNA profiles with available FTV data to develop breast cancer subtype-specific predictors of pCR, and (3) build
prognostic models that combine ctDNA and FTV information to improve on the predictive performance of residual
cancer burden (RCB) assessed at surgery.
 The deliverables of this proposed study include: (1) serial ctDNA profiles in a large cohort of early breast
cancer patients; (2) a prediction tool that will calculate the probability of pCR (or residual cancer burden, RCB
0) at an early time point during treatment, and (3) a prognostic tool that will provide accurate risk assessment
for early metastatic recurrence in patients who have residual disease after NAC (non-pCR or RCB 1/2/3).
 Our ultimate goal is to use the pCR prediction tool in the clinical trial setting to identify good responders who
may be eligible for early surgical treatment to reduce exposure to toxicities from unnecessary additional
therapies; and poor responders who may benefit from a switch in therapy to increase the likelihood of achieving
a pCR. Furthermore, we envision that the prognostic tool developed here will help guide treatment choices in
the adjuvant trial setting by providing aggressive adjuvant therapies to patients who are at high-risk of early
metastatic recurrence, while de-escalating or forgoing further treatment for those who were potentially cured by
NAC and surgical treatment and, therefore, not likely to recur."

Despite the recognition of the contribution of the immune system to cancer response to ionizing radiation,
successful translation to the clinic is lagging. We are proposing to adapt the ROBIN mechanisms of research to
enable a deep dive into the field of radiation (RT) and immunity. Representatives from seven international
academic centers already engaged in RT and immunity research have converged to participate in a small
prospective clinical trial (accrual: 25 patients in US and 25 patients in Europe), to synergize and accelerate
discovery. The setting of preoperative short course radiotherapy (SCRT) in rectal cancer, has emerged as ideal
for the scientific questions posed. SCRT is a standard treatment, preceded and followed by colonoscopies to
respectively assess tumor baseline extent and response (at the end of RT): during each colonoscopy consenting
patients can donate a tumor biopsy, as well as stool and blood (PBMC) samples. The same set of specimens
can be harvested, six weeks later at surgery, where research sampling of lymph nodes will also be possible,
within and outside the RT field. These sequential sets of tissues will enable us to conduct cutting edge multiple
“omics” approaches to study irradiated normal and cancer tissue and the microbiome in the RT field. The PBMC
analysis will allow correlation at a single cell level between RT-induced oxidative stress, changes in
immunophenotype and PBMC biology. Similarly, the ability to analyze lymph nodes harvested inside and outside
the radiation field will allow to pinpoint at the single cell level the RT effects on each immune subpopulation. The
longitudinal analysis on cancer biopsy, collected before and after RT and at surgery, will give a snapshot on the
RT-induced “omics” changes. An orthogonal radiomic study will analyze MR images obtained before SCRT and
before surgery (also standard imaging procedures in rectal cancer) together with images obtained at CT
simulation. Compliance with international regulations for data sharing, standardization of procedures and data
acquisition and harmonization of uploaded data will be essential to this effort. Advanced bioinformatics tools will
be applied through a dedicated Data Sharing and Integrative Analysis Core, capable to deconvolute and interpret
complex biological and imaging data, sorted by utilizing NCI FireCloud workspaces. By converging experienced
clinical investigators, bio-scientists and bio-informaticians to address fundamental radiation biology questions,
this ROBIN will rapidly enable unprecedented discovery that will be shared with the ROBIN network and the
scientific community at large.
Finally, since inception, ROBIN has revealed an optimal environment for cross-training and cross-fertilization of
the scientists and clinicians involved in the grant preparation and has created a robust foundation for the
proposed Cross Training Core, a novel structure to form future leaders in radiation oncology and biology, a task
each of the three P.I.s consider crucial to the future of our discipline."

The overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to use an innovative, translational digital health and
computational approach to address the critical need for more effective autism screening tools, objective outcome
measures, and brain-based biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials with young autistic children. An
Administrative Core, Dissemination and Outreach Core, and Data Management and Analysis Core will support
three Projects. Project 1 will recruit a large population of 16- to 30-month-old toddlers through primary care clinics
to evaluate the accuracy of a remotely administered novel digital phenotyping application (app) for detecting
early signs of autism. The app automatically quantifies observations of children’s behavior using computer vision
analysis and is deployed on widely available devices. The usability of the app for longitudinal outcome monitoring
will be assessed at 16-30, 36, and 48 months of age. The feasibility of using computer vision analysis to measure
patterns of caregiver-child interactions from videos recorded at home will be explored. Project 2 will develop a
complementary autism screening approach by using North Carolina Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield claims
data (N ~ 230,000, autism cases ~6,000) to create a generalizable autism prediction model based on routine
health data collected from birth to 18 months. Then, using Duke University Health System electronic health
records (EHR; N ~ 64,000, autism cases ~ 800), this Project will use natural language processing to assess the
added predictive value of EHR elements not captured in claims data (e.g., clinician notes). Both data sets will be
leveraged to gain insight into the nature and prevalence of medical conditions in infants and toddlers who are
later diagnosed with autism. Projects 1 and 2 will collaboratively engage primary care providers and other
stakeholders to design an automated clinical decision support tool for autism screening that, in the future, could
be integrated into the primary care provider’s clinical workflow. Project 3 will use an innovative machine learning
computational method to develop a multimodal biomarker that combines features of electroencephalographic
(EEG) activity and synchronized measures of children’s behavior (e.g., social attention) automatically coded via
computer vision analysis, with a focus on neural connectivity measured via traditional methods (coherence,
phase-lag index) and novel neural network analysis methods (discriminative cross-spectral factor analysis)
developed by our team. This multimodal approach will be evaluated in 3–6-year-old autistic children without
intellectual disability (ID), age- and sex-matched neurotypical children, and autistic children with ID (IQ <= 70).
Across Projects, our Center’s team will share cutting-edge computational methods to develop new tools that can
address long-standing barriers to optimal care and enhanced quality of life for autistic children and their families."

10897125,"ABSTRACT
 Preclinical studies indicate that the neurobiology of obesity may be related to diet-induced cellular
inflammatory responses in hypothalamic areas that regulate body weight. In rodent models of diet-induced
obesity, overfeeding by high-fat diet rapidly induces inflammation and gliosis in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus. Moreover, these glial cell inflammatory responses are both necessary and sufficient to
induce hyperphagia and weight gain, suggesting that gliosis plays a mechanistic role in the ability of diet to
induce obesity in rodent models. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the investigators discovered the
first evidence of hypothalamic gliosis in humans with obesity. These findings have since been replicated in
adults and children with obesity as well as in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. However, the current
evidence in humans is observational, and the lack of controlled clinical experiments limits our
understanding of whether findings of hypothalamic gliosis are diet-induced in humans. The overall goal of
the proposed research is to determine the feasibility, promise, and safety of an experimental model
in humans to test the effects of hypercaloric, obesogenic diets on hypothalamic gliosis as
measured by MRI. The proposed mechanistic clinical trial is in response to PA-20-160 (Small R01s for
Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK). Using a randomized clinical trial design
and a eucaloric control group, the proposal aims to compare the effect of two overfeeding regimens that
vary in caloric load (but not macronutrient composition) on hypothalamic gliosis as measured by MRI. A
second goal is to determine whether a standardized hypocaloric diet following the overfeeding regimen is a
feasible strategy to mitigate any observed weight gain and/or hypothalamic gliosis due to overfeeding.
Finally, the feasibility, acceptability, and long-term weight effects of study participation will be assessed.
Forty-two participants with overweight will undergo serial MRI scans before, during, and at completion of 7
days of overfeeding or eucaloric diet as well as before, during, and at completion of a 7-day hypocaloric or
eucaloric diet period. Diet composition during overfeeding will be based on preclinical studies of gliosis and
utilize a robust stimulus that is high in dietary fat, saturated fat, and refined carbohydrates and most would
consider obesogenic. Effect sizes, feasibility, and safety data will contribute to the design of future
mechanistic clinical trials. Additional future directions include parsing which diet elements (e.g., caloric
excess, saturated fatty acids) elicit radiologic evidence of inflammation and gliosis in the mediobasal
hypothalamus. The proposed study represents a necessary first step in testing the hypothesis that a
hypercaloric, obesogenic diet induces inflammation and structural changes in body-weight-regulating areas
of the brain in humans—changes that promote the development of obesity and metabolic disease."

10733448,"Project Summary
 In this study we seek to understand how rare genetic variation in all protein coding genes (the exome)
influences the risk of developing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is of major public health
importance owing to its profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about its etiology, and
treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, ADHD), whole exome
sequencing (WES) in large numbers of subjects has begun to deliver fundamental knowledge about genetic
architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize pathways altered in disease. We intend to
realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing the worldwide number of OCD subjects with
WES data, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental biology of this condition.
 Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will produce WES data from 5,100
OCD subjects and 3,000 ancestry-matched controls, all from Sweden and Norway. Sequencing individuals
from these countries provides the substantial advantage of knowing about co-morbid conditions. We will call
rare genetic variation from the sequencing data. Second, we will combine these new data with existing WES
data for ~1,400 OCD cases and ~8,000 controls. This will increase power to identify OCD risk genes, which we
will do using a combination of existing and novel analytical methods. Third, we will further refine our
understanding of the genetic architecture of OCD, focusing on the relationship of OCD risk to risk for other
neurodevelopmental disorders, including tic disorders, autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Combining WES data from multiple large studies will enhance power to identify shared loci and begin to
identify loci with greater specificity for OCD. Overall, we believe this study will improve our understanding of
genetic risk factors for OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and
societal costs."
10926848,"The Vanderbilt TBEL Center assembles a multi-disciplinary team of field-specific experts to collaboratively
investigate the basic and translational pathways of colonic pre-cancer progression. Our foundational work on
two subtypes of colonic pre-cancers, adenomas (ADs) and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), depicts the early
origins of tumorigenesis that are shaped by modulation of the immune microenvironment via neoplastic cells and
the microbiota. We have shown that SSLs originate from gastric metaplasia arising from the mucosal surface in
a cytotoxic immune microenvironment, whereas ADs arise from stem cell-derived WNT activation at the crypt
base. In this center, we will extend our investigation of specific biological mechanisms towards the developmental
trajectories of these pre-malignant lesions into progression or indolence. Basic Project 1 investigates the
contribution of neutrophil-AD crosstalk, largely via dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1) both at the cell surface and released
in small extracellular vesicles, in the course of AD progression. Translational Project 2 investigates, in human
prospective studies, the association of pks+ Escherichia coli that induces genotoxic stress with pre-cancer
progression, as well as colon epithelial cell and mucosa mechanisms that may contribute to a polyp-promoting
microenvironment. Basic Project 3 investigates acquisition of stemness in modulating antigen presentation to
cytotoxic T cells in the context of co-evolution between neoplastic cells and the immune system. Joint analysis
of common colorectal pre-cancer tissues will facilitate an ongoing process of iteration and integration across all
projects. Our TBEL Center offers a complementary blend, from reductionist and systems biology approaches, to
investigate critical factors involved in the progression of pre-cancerous tumors of the colon to CRC. The work
will utilize cutting-edge technologies on human tissues, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, small
extracellular vesicle profiling, multiplex imaging, longitudinal data analysis, and next-generation computational
algorithms. In addition, substantial human polyp resources previously established by the Vanderbilt GI
Specialized Programs of Research Excellence and the NCI Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network will be
leveraged by the same team of investigators in the TBEL Center. In addition, an innovative co-culture system
will be employed by each project, where polarizing pre-cancer organoids can be co-cultured with key
microenvironment elements exposed to neoplastic cells from the luminal or basal side. This work will inform the
modeling of tumor development trajectories and identify mechanisms of progression that will enable
improvements in risk stratification, precision prevention, and interception for individuals with colorectal pre-
cancers."
10771309,"Abstract
One of the oldest and most deeply studied problems in developmental gene expression is the switch from fetal
to adult type hemoglobin in red blood cell precursors. Interest in this question has been fueled by its relevance
to genetic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, and knowledge about regulatory
processes is being translated into gene therapies and other therapeutic approaches. BCL11A is a critical
player in the globin switch, but how it is regulated developmentally is surprisingly still largely unclear. Our
preliminary data show that BCL11A is controlled predominantly at the transcriptional level. Via a CRISPR-Cas9
genetic screen we identified the transcriptional repressor HIC2 as a novel regulator of hemoglobin switching.
HIC2 is expressed highly in fetal erythroid cells and extinguished in adult erythroid cells. Our preliminary data
further suggest that HIC2 represses BCL11A transcription specifically in fetal type cells by directly
decommissioning a fetal stage-specific BCL11A enhancer element. Together, these observations define the
foundational hypothesis of this application: HIC2 expression is extinguished in adult red cells, allowing for the
activation of a BCL11A enhancer to boost BCL11A expression in adult cells and trigger the silencing of fetal
type globin genes. This places HIC2 upstream of BCL11A in the regulatory circuitry that controls hemoglobin
switching. Additional preliminary data suggest that HIC2 promotes a broader fetal transcriptional program. In
Specific Aim 1 we will examine the biology of HIC2 in gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vivo using a
combination of cell culture models and whole animal studies. Specific Aim 2 is focused on mechanistic
experiments, defining the way by which HIC2 regulates chromatin features and transcription factor binding at
target genes, including BCL11A, and what HIC2 co-factors are involved. Specific Aim 3 is dedicated to
defining the developmental control of HIC2 expression. This will be accomplished by characterizing the
regulatory landscape of the HIC2 locus in fetal and adult erythroblasts in combination with developmental
stage specific perturbative experiments.
In sum, the proposed studies aim to understand the role of HIC2 in hemoglobin switching and in the
establishment of a fetal erythroid state at an organismal and molecular level. This proposal is expected to
produce results with ramifications for a broader understanding of developmental hematopoiesis as well as the
treatment of sickle cell disease and thalassemia."
10926874,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall
The long-term goal of this Program is to define mechanisms of acquired drug resistance in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) so that novel drug combinations can be deployed to prevent disease relapse and improve patient
outcomes. The overall five-year survival rate for AML remains 20%, an outcome that has not changed for several
decades. Although seven new regimens have been approved for AML in recent years, the improved initial
remission rates with these therapies do not lead to durable outcomes. Disease relapse is fueled by a complex
cross-talk of tumor cells adapting with support from the bone marrow microenvironment. The investigators of this
proposed ARTNet Center have collaborated for 15+ years, including as a Center in the DRSN consortium – the
predecessor to ARTNet. Our prior work has involved development of the largest-to-date functional genomic
dataset on AML patient samples, genome-wide CRISPR screens, broad studies of AML interactions with stromal
and immune cells, and testing of diverse drug combinations. These studies have led to >150 collaborative
publications, continuous collaborative funding for 15+ years, creation of numerous large datasets deposited into
public repositories, and translation of findings into numerous clinical trials. Our overarching hypothesis is that
the architecture of acquired drug resistance is governed by temporal extrinsic and intrinsic factors and
elucidating this trajectory will allow for the identification of properly timed therapeutic strategies to stave
off acquired resistance and stay ahead of tumor evolution and adaptation. This hypothesis will be tested
through three well integrated Projects addressing the following questions: 1) How does AML tumor cell intrinsic
biology adapt to evade therapeutic pressure? We will use genome-wide CRISPR platforms as well as long-term
progenitor expansion of primary AML patient samples to understand feedback pathways and shifting epigenetic
and cell state landscapes that can drive acquired drug resistance. 2) How does the stromal and immune
microenvironment govern drug resistance? We will use co-culture and advanced bone marrow models to perform
genome-wide screens and test the impact of single-agents on AML-microenvironment cross-talk. Through
computational modeling, we will nominate targeting strategies to mitigate tumor extrinsic resistance signals and
boost immune anti-tumor responses. 3) How can resistance signatures and drug combinations be effectively
clinically translated? We will use high-throughput and advanced, engineered models of human bone marrow to
test and prioritize drug combinations from targets in Projects 1 and 2. We will also study longitudinal specimens
from patients enrolled on ongoing clinical trials. All of these data will inform and refine the work of Projects 1 and
2. Our Center will be supported by an Administrative Core and a Functional Phenotyping Core. Collectively, we
will develop a comprehensive understanding of acquired drug resistance in AML and identify new regimens to
treat patients at the earliest possible stage, prevent relapse, and achieve durable remissions."

Science Institute (TUTSI), developed a critical mass of clinical and translational researchers, and increased
scientific productivity in cardiometabolic diseases at Tulane University. Seven of 12 COBRE Research Project
Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project Leaders (PPLs) have been funded for one or more peer-reviewed research
projects from NIH and NSF. COBRE investigators have published 310 peer-reviewed scientific articles (140
from RPLs and PPLs and 170 from other COBRE investigators and collaborators) supported by the COBRE
Phase 1 grant (GM109036). The overall objective of this COBRE Phase 2 application is to further
develop and strengthen the clinical and translational research infrastructure at Tulane University and
to continuously expand and support a critical mass of investigators with expertise in clinical and
translational research in cardiometabolic diseases. The specific aims of this COBRE Phase 2 application
are: 1) to enhance and sustain TUTSI, a university-wide thematic multidisciplinary Center for clinical and
translational research on cardiometabolic diseases that motivates and facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration
among basic, clinical, and population scientists; 2) to develop and nurture the next generation of investigators
in clinical and translational science focused on cardiometabolic diseases; 3) to achieve the aims of the
innovative Research Projects proposed by our four RPLs, including to elucidate metabolomic mechanisms of
apolipoprotein L1 risk alleles associated with kidney disease progression in Black patients, to identify
biomarkers of type 2 diabetes in adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles, to investigate the interrelations
among amylase gene copy number variants, carbohydrate intake, and incident hyperglycemia and type 2
diabetes, and to test the intake-response effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure in a
randomized controlled trial; and 4) to establish and strengthen a Clinical Research and Community
Engagement Core, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core, and Molecular Detection and Diagnostics Core and
expand innovative technical and methodologic support to RPLs, PPLs, other COBRE investigators, and
collaborators at Tulane University. Our COBRE program is unique because it addresses a significant public
health problem in Louisiana and the nation and focuses on novel clinical and translational research. If funded,
this COBRE Phase 2 program will play a central role in expanding and strengthening clinical and translational
research infrastructure and in recruiting, nurturing, and advancing a cadre of well-trained interdisciplinary
investigators in cardiometabolic disease research. The COBRE investigators will generate and apply new
knowledge to patient care and disease prevention and ultimately contribute to reducing the burden of
cardiometabolic diseases and improving the health of individuals and the public in Louisiana and beyond."

increase vulnerability for developing depression and depression-related behaviors in clinical populations and
preclinical animal models, respectively. One area of the brain that has gained attention as of late is the lateral
habenula (LHb), in part because of its ability to tightly constrain dopamine activity. Notably, the LHb is
hyperactive in individuals suffering from major depression, while restoring normal activity in this area has
emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy in treatment-resistant patients. Although we still do not know how
chronic stress leads to LHb dysfunction, one intriguing possibility is through stress-induced alterations in the
endogenous cannabinoid (ECB) system. The primary role of the ECB system in the brain is to provide activity-
dependent, on-demand negative feedback, which helps to maintain synaptic homeostasis. Our data indicate
that chronic stress augments ECB signaling in the LHb, while local activation of this system elicits a passive-
despair-like coping strategy, impairs behavioral flexibility in an attentional set-shifting task, and decreases the
firing rate of dopamine neurons located in the ventral tegmental area. However, the precise role of the ECB
system in the LHb and the mechanisms by which this system modulates stress-related behaviors has yet to be
formally evaluated. In the current proposal, we will fill this important gap in knowledge by systematically
examining how the ECB system modulates LHb function and identifying whether chronic stress-induced
alterations in this system are necessary to produce deficits in dopamine cell firing and the expression of
depression-related behaviors. In Aim 1, we will perform site-specific pharmacological manipulations of the
ECB system in tandem with in vivo electrophysiology recordings of dopamine cell activity in freely behaving
rats to uncover how stress-induced alterations in LHb ECB signaling may contribute to deficits in behavioral
flexibility. In Aim 2, we will use ex vivo electrophysiology combined with retrograde labeling of LHb projections
to identify the role of the ECB system in modulating excitatory and inhibitory LHb inputs and examine how
chronic stress alters ECB control of synaptic strength at projectionally defined LHb synapses. In Aim 3, we will
use a combinatorial viral approach to determine effects of acute, circuit-specific activation of LHb neurons on
stress coping and behavioral flexibility, and test whether chronic, long-term LHb activation recapitulates the
behavioral effects of chronic stress in an ECB-dependent manner. Broadly stated, the proposed research will
fill a significant gap in the field by identifying how the ECB system regulates the activity of a key circuit that has
been implicated in various domains of mental health, and the neurophysiological and behavioral consequences
of stress-induced alterations in this system. Moreover, this work will pave the way for future studies exploring
the involvement of this system in brain function and disease."
10741818,"The proposed Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Toxicology (SURE Tox) program at the
University of Illinois will provide high quality research experiences for under-represented minority
undergraduate students during the summer academic break. The SURE Tox program will have its own
identity, but it will also complement existing funded programs for undergraduate and medical students at the
University of Illinois such as the Environmental Interdisciplinary Toxicology Program, the Summer Research
Opportunities Program, the Toxicology Scholars Program, and the Summer Research Program for Veterinary
Medical Students. The program will involve active participation by faculty members from several departments
and colleges at the University of Illinois, all of whom have expertise in environmental health/toxicology and
experience training undergraduate students.
The proposed training program will enroll 7 junior and senior undergraduate students who will spend 10 weeks
over the summer in the program. The specific goals of the program are to: 1) match participants with faculty
mentors who will direct the student to complete a hypothesis-driven project in the field of environmental
health/toxicology, 2) help each student learn laboratory techniques and research skills, 3) provide didactic
training on animal use in research, the responsible conduct of research, and use of the electronic library, 4)
train students to prepare scientific talks and posters and to present their work at scientific meetings, 5) provide
networking opportunities for students to meet other students and faculty members in research, 6) provide
students with information on academic vs. industry careers in toxicology, and 7) provide each participant the
opportunity to participate in GRE Institute workshops to prepare for the Graduate Record Exam. At the
conclusion of the program, the students will present their work at the Illinois Summer Research Symposium
held on campus. This training program will provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students,
specifically minority students, to obtain training and research experience in the field of environmental health/
toxicology at a research intensive university with outstanding toxicology programs."
10745317,"Project Summary
Metastatic lesions encompass approximately 80% of all CNS tumors. Of that, breast cancer brain metastasis
comprises a third of all brain metastases. Treatment options are few and often only offer palliative support, but
include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Ionizing radiation is observed to disrupt the BTB,
however the mechanism and time course of molecular events following radiation exposure remains poorly
understood. Gap: There is currently no consensus on the sequence of events following radiation therapy for
patients with brain metastases, and whether or not chemotherapy can be effectively timed with windows of
greatest disruption of the BTB. My goal during the F99 phase is to elucidate the time line, at a range of
clinically relevant doses, of radiation-induced BTB openings and determine if two approved therapeutics, when
given at windows of greatest disruption, lead to increased cytotoxicity when timed competently rather than at
random. The training plan set forth in this application employs a wide variety of experimental techniques
including animal modeling of metastatic brain cancer, multiple imaging modalities, use of radiation in small
animals, design of clinically translatable experiments, and conducting science with integrity in a rigorous and
competitive field. This project uses an innovative approach combining our novel brain tropic breast cancer cell
lines with small animal radiation techniques. Herein, we will use our unique multimodal fluorescence and
phosphorescent imaging techniques to monitor changes in BTB permeability. I will complete this research
under the mentorship of Dr. Paul R. Lockman, whose lab boasts a strong publication record with excellent
funding in the field of brain metastases of breast cancer. The F99 phase of this award aligns with the remaining
2 years I have of my time in the Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences graduate program at West
Virginia University. Our institutional environment is more than adequately positioned to conduct the research
and training described in this proposal, which more than demonstrates the quality and strength offered by the
faculty at our university. In the K00 phase of this award, I will identify a postdoctoral mentor at an institution
with a strong cancer center allowing me to pursue further the cellular and molecular foundation of BBB/BTB
regulation in brain metastases from a different, but complementary avenue. Combined together, the two
phases of this award will provide me with the means to establish myself as a successful cancer researcher
and enable me to lay the foundation for my own independent cancer research laboratory predicated on
the study of the molecular interworking of the BTB in CNS metastatic lesions and novel treatment strategies."
10902123,"Center Overview Abstract
The University of Pittsburgh Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) directly addresses the Interagency Autism
Coordinating Committee’s call for research on adult mental health to improve safety and quality of life, and to
reduce premature mortality. We do so by generating the measures and mechanistic targets needed to improve
mental health and reduce suicide risk in autistic adults. We address this understudied and critical topic in
authentic partnership with autistic adults and their allies. We emphasize mechanistic translation, bring new
researchers to work on autism, and provide an academic home for junior researchers getting started in this
area. We will assemble a Pittsburgh ACE cohort of 200 autistic and 100 non-autistic 18- to 65-year-old adults
(≥ 50 with recent suicidality in each group) who will complete three projects that are focused on different units
of analysis (self-report, behavior and ambulatory physiology, and neural circuits), time scales, and primary
outcomes, all related to adult mental health. Project 1 will provide the first dimensional self-report questionnaire
of suicidality developed for ASD and the first longitudinal characterization of suicidality in autistic adults. Project
2’s innovative physiologically-triggered ecological momentary design will characterize proximal risk processes
for suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, and impulsive aggression in a temporally sensitive manner to
allow for future interventions prior to escalation of emotion dysregulation and harmful outcomes. Project 3 tests
a neural mechanistic model of early neural hyper-reactivity to stimuli followed by decreased recruitment of
regulatory resources and consequent physiological, subjective, and behavioral hypo-reactivity. Our Clinical
Core provides data to all of the projects to characterize the sample, including novel phenotypic measures (e.g.,
a biomarker of aging based on structural brain images). Our Center structure enables us to integrate data from
all sources to enhance the impact of individual projects. For example, we will speed translation by connecting a
biological causal mechanism to lived experience and longitudinal outcomes. We will pool all data to identify the
most salient predictors of suicidality trajectories, providing a significant advance over approaches that consider
small sets of predictors and enabling determination of relative contributions to risk. We will shed light on
heterogeneity in outcomes by connecting subgroups based on daily dynamics of emotion and physiological
reactivity and regulation to neural reactivity and suicidality. Our age range and transdiagnostic, suicidal
comparison group allows us to determine what is unique about mental health in ASD and how aging may play
a role. We will employ novel means to disseminate this critical information to the community with the help of
our team of autistic partners from diverse backgrounds. This process will ensure that our Center will not only
engage individuals from groups that have been marginalized, but will also create and maintain mutually
beneficial and rewarding relationships that will enhance and enrich our research sample, outcomes, and
overall impact."
10764193,"SUMMARY STATEMENT
Aggression is an innate social behavior seen across vertebrate species. Although an essential
means to compete for resources and defend oneself, aggression is also a costly behavior with
potentially deadly consequences. Hence, it is important for animals to direct aggression toward
the correct targets to maximize benefits and minimize risk associated with fighting. In humans,
misdirected aggression is particularly destructive as it often targets the most important people in
one’s life—spouse, children, caregivers, or even oneself. Such misdirected aggression can strain
relationship and cause tremendous physical and mental stress. For example, individuals with
certain psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are
more likely to express misdirected aggression, jeopardizing their own and others' lives. The goal
of the current project is to elucidate the neural mechanisms that allow an animal to
generate properly directed aggression. Doing so involves multiple behavioral processes. In
mice, for example, individuals in a social group first learn the social status of each member
through repeated agonistic interactions. Then, in subsequent encounters, they recognize the
social status of an opponent and use this information to determine whether to initiate attack. Here,
we will investigate the neural mechanisms supporting each of these behavioral processes that
ultimately allow mice to selectively initiate aggression. Given the well-known role of dopamine in
reinforcement learning, Aim 1 will address whether dopamine from the ventral tegmental area
(VTA) plays an important role in fighting-outcome-based social learning and aggression
expression. We will use a systematic approach to identify the key site(s) of dopamine action in
modulating aggression. Aim 2 will examine the neural representation of social status information,
with particular focus on the posterior part of the medial preoptic nucleus (pMPOA), a key upstream
region of multiple nodes in the aggression circuit. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional role of
pMPOA projections in directing aggression via pathway-specific optogenetic manipulation. In
summary, this study will reveal how social status information is represented in the brain and used
to direct aggression toward the right social targets. It further promises to provide new
understanding of dopamine's role in aggression and associated social learning. If successful, our
proposed investigations will provide new insight into the fine neural control of aggression, and
may yield new therapeutic targets for suppressing the exaggerated and mistargeted aggression
accompanying some psychiatric conditions."
10728332,"Background: Prevalence of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 70% higher in veterans than
the general population. Annual cost for non-dialysis dependent CKD population care increased to $18 billion in
FY 2016 for Veterans Administration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered standard of care for CKD patients as they improve cardiovascular
outcomes and retard progression to end stage kidney disease. Among veterans with diabetes and CKD, only
66% are on ACEI or ARB with significant variation across facilities. Among the ~34% not receiving ACEI or
ARB, it is unclear whether they were started on these agents, started but stopped due to an adverse event or
never started on ACEI or ARBs for e.g. due to clinical inertia. ACEI/ARB discontinuation is associated with an
increased need for dialysis and a higher risk of mortality. In this proposal, we plan to understand the proportion
of underuse of ACEI/ARB attributed to side effects versus clinical inertia using structured datasets and
unstructured provider text notes, and barriers to initiation and re-initiation (after being discontinued) of
ACEI/ARB. Based on these learnings, we propose to pilot test a communication aid in patient aligned care
teams (PACTs), which will assist clinicians to initiate or reinitiate ACEI/ARB therapy in CKD patients.
Significance: Successful implementation of the proposed study will help us (a) understand the reasons for
lack of initiation of ACEI or ARB and their discontinuation (b) successfully develop, refine and pilot test a
communication aid to optimize ACEI/ARB use among CKD population. These could reduce kidney disease
progression, an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes and potential cost savings for the VA system.
Innovation: The project utilizes both structured and unstructured data using natural language processing
(NLP) to understand the full context for underutilization of ACEI or ARBS. Furthermore, we utilize innovative
qualitative techniques and human factors bests practices to study and address this important gap in care.
Aim 1: To examine reasons for lack of initiation and discontinuation of ACEI or ARBs among CKD patients
based on structured data and automated information extraction using NLP. Aim 2: To conduct semi-structured
interviews with PACT providers and patients at two tertiary care facilities and their community-based outpatient
clinics (CBOCs) to further understand the reasons for lack of initiation or discontinuation of ACEI or ARBs
among veterans with CKD. Based on these interviews, we will refine a succinct communication aid targeted
towards PACT providers which will allow them to effectively initiate and/or reinitiate ACEI/ARB in CKD patients
(including those with prior side effects). Aim3: To pilot test a communication aid for clinicians to improve
initiation of ACEI or ARB or re-initiation of ACEI or ARB after being discontinued due to an adverse event.
Methodology: For Aim 1, we will identify CKD patients using VA structured datasets and will randomly
partition them into training and a test set. We will then train our NLP system to achieve a target sensitivity and
specificity of >90% compared with manual chart review to assess reasons for lack of initiation/reinitiation of
ACEI/ARB. For Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured patient and provider interviews to understand barriers
towards lack of initiation or reinitiation of ACEI or ARBs in CKD patients. We will then refine the content of a
communication aid (using a human factors expert) for use during the pilot trial in Aim 3. For Aim 3, we will
conduct a pilot trial. All PACT providers at the intervention sites will receive the communication aid to improve
initiation of ACEI/ARB or reinitiation of ACEI/ARB after being discontinued due to an adverse event. At the
usual care sites, PACT providers will only receive a quarterly report of the proportion of their CKD patients not
on an ACEI/ARB. Our primary outcome is the change in the proportion of CKD patients receiving ACEI/ARBs.
Next Steps: If our pilot study in Aim 3 is successful, then we will aim towards a system-wide implementation of
our communication aid throughout our VISN to improve ACEI or ARB use in veterans with CKD."
10728333,"No systematic, automated process for providing feedback to acute care providers exists in the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), despite there being 432,000 acute care visits annually by Veterans seeking acute
care via the emergency department (ED), urgent care clinics, or primary care clinics in the VHA. More
than 144 million prescriptions are written in these VHA acute care settings each year, many for antibiotics or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). More than 30% of acute care prescriptions for antibiotics
or NSAIDs are inappropriate and carry associated increased risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) due to lack
of patient or comorbidity familiarity, drug-drug interactions, and patient pressure to prescribe. Currently, acute
outpatient care providers operate without knowledge of their own prescribing quality or patient outcomes. This
absence of feedback creates a vacuum through which providers may falsely assume a positive outcome.
Inadequate outcomes feedback and understanding of indications and contraindications to prescribing
antibiotics and NSAIDs have hindered improvement in the quality and safety of prescriptions for Veteran in
acute care settings. We will use user-centered design to develop a scalable prescribing feedback system that
includes audit and feedback, academic detailing, and non-financial incentives, will be implemented to examine
how this multifaceted intervention impacts potentially inappropriate prescribing and ADEs in acute outpatient
care settings in the VHA.
This project describes a mixed-methods proposal that addresses major HSR&D priorities to improve Veteran
health and advance the VHA as a learning healthcare system. The Specific Aims are: 1) Evaluate
determinants of potentially inappropriate prescribing to design intervention implementation in acute outpatient
care settings.; 2) Develop and evaluate a risk-adjusted provider profiling surveillance system; 3) Refine the
visual representation of the feedback system with user-centered design; and 4) Examine the impact of
implementation of a multifaceted intervention on potentially inappropriate prescriptions and ADEs.
The team is uniquely qualified to accomplish these aims, with expertise in healthcare operations research,
informatics, human factors engineering and user-centered design, implementation science, qualitative
methods, and practicing clinicians in acute care settings (emergency department and primary care). The
institutional environment at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System and Vanderbilt University Medical
Center is outstanding, including the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), a site for VA
Quality Scholars, an innovative qualitative research center; nationally ranked graduate programs in the
relevant fields of study; and the national CTSA coordinating center.
This application will develop an automated feedback system for acute care providers using antibiotic and
NSAID prescribing as two exemplars of the need for acute care provider feedback in the VHA. Taking a user-
centered approach by placing the provider at the center of the design process will substantially advance the
ability to enhance provider activities through the delivery of scalable feedback using Veteran, provider, and
stakeholder input. Advancing the delivery of acute outpatient provider feedback creates a mechanism to
improve provider quality and safety, and ultimately to enhance Veteran health."

Transgender, and gender diverse adults (TGDAs) experience severe inequities rooted in and reflective of
historical stigmatization due to their gender status and resulting in significant health disparities. In
accordance with minority stress theory, systematic oppression, discrimination, and stigma are distal
stressors that manifest through experiences of interpersonal violence and microaggressions. These
experiences can lead to increased levels of stress and, in turn, alcohol abuse and drug use. Consequently,
TGDAs experience high prevalence of adverse mental health and physical health outcomes in comparison
to their cisgender counterparts. These risk factors and experiences of stress may increase the likelihood of
TGDAs’ experiencing and/or perpetrating interpersonal violence. Unfortunately, few efficacious,
comprehensive strategies for prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse, drug use, interpersonal violence,
mental health and physical health have been specifically designed for TGDAs. The primary goal of this
proposal is to use minority stress model and intersectionality to examine a host of stressors that contribute
to inequities in alcohol abuse and drug use, cross-reciprocal interpersonal violence, and subsequent
physical and mental health outcomes among TGDAs. The goal will be achieved by conducting a 12-month
prospective cohort study with a racially and gender diverse sample of 400 TGDAs, ages 18-55. The
following aims will be fulfilled: Aim 1:Identify the structural/community factors and proximal/distal minority
stressors most strongly predictive of alcohol abuse and drug use as intermediary outcomes to mental health
outcomes (i.e., depression, PTSD, etc.) and physical health outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, sleep,
etc.) for TGDAs; Aim 2: Evaluate if differences in Aim 1 direct and indirect effects are evident by TGD
subgroup (i.e., gender diverse, transfeminine, transmasculine) and across intersecting identities of
race/ethnicity; Aim 3: Examine whether Aim 1 associations are moderated by resilience factors (i.e.,
healthcare utilization, social support), and Aim 4: Explore the mechanistic roles of acute and chronic daily
stresses (assessed by biomarkers), controlling for sex hormones, in associations examined for Aim 1.
Another subaim will be to examine the intraindividual variability in the momentary cross-reciprocal
relationship between interpersonal violence and alcohol abuse. Multiple forms of data will be collected to
assess these goals: 1) self- reported survey data collected at baseline, 6- and 12-months, 2) ecological
momentary assessments administered, and 3) saliva, hair clippings, and cheek swabs, in addition to BMI,
blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio. Our expected outcomes are to provide evidence regarding modifiable
factors associated with alcohol use and drug use as well as the pathways by which interpersonal violence
and physical and mental health outcomes occur,and to identify priorities in treatment and prevention
designed for TGDAs."
10517430,"Intimate partner violence (IPV), the physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression, or stalking by
a current or former intimate partner, is a significant public health concern affecting approximately 10 million
people in the United States annually. Approximately 33% of women exposed to IPV report physical trauma
resulting in heighted risk of head injury in this population. Recent work suggests that anywhere from 40-90% of
women experience head trauma due to IPV. IPV-related head trauma is caused by blunt force trauma, being
pushed or violently shaken, and/or strangulation, which can result in focal trauma or contusions, acceleration
and deceleration injuries, as well as hypoxia and anoxia due to strangulation, respectively. Limited research
has shown that women exposed to IPV with head trauma report higher depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder symptomatology, as well as impaired cognitive function relative to women with IPV and no
exposure to head trauma. Although the clinical features of repeated exposure to head trauma identified in IPV
are similar to the effects observed in military traumatic brain injury (TBI) and sports-related concussion, limited
work has been done to understand IPV-related head trauma, in particular its chronic cognitive and
psychological effects as well as associated brain changes. Through a multi-site research collaboration
consisting of members of the Enhancing NeuroImaging and Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) IPV
Working Group, the proposed study will characterize the cognitive, psychological, and neural profiles of IPV-
related head trauma, as well as determine whether specific symptoms clusters are associated with discernable
IPV subgroups. Furthermore, this proposal initiates the process of creating an IPV study cohort that will be re-
assessed every 5 years to chronically assess brain and behavioral changes associated with IPV-related head
trauma over the lifespan. Semi-structured interviews will be used to obtain IPV specific information such as
abuse and head trauma history and frequency. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery will be used to
determine cognitive and psychological status, while sophisticated neuroimaging techniques will be used to
characterize neural structure, function, and brain metabolites in IPV with exposure to head trauma relative to
IPV without exposure to head trauma. Finally, we will use a data-driven approach to determine whether
symptom clusters differentiate subgroups of IPV. In aim 1, we will identify the cognitive and psychological
profiles of subgroups of IPV. Aim 2 will examine the neuroimaging signatures in subgroups of IPV. In aim 3, we
will determine whether symptom clusters are associated with discernible subgroups of IPV. The results from
this study will provide critical information about the role of IPV-related head trauma in cognitive and
psychological outcomes, as well as the underlying neural changes. This is important not only for understanding
the chronic effects of repetitive brain trauma, but also the identification of distinct subgroups of IPV has direct
implications for development of patient-centered care approaches for IPV."
10791738,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Generation of adaptive immune responses to vaccines and infections necessitates highly coordinated
crosstalk between cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Using advanced imaging approaches, which
we developed, we have recently established that lymph nodes are organized into discrete micro-environments
(MEs) composed of different innate immune cell populations. In the past award cycle, we developed additional
3D quantitative imaging tools and described novel features of innate cell organization in lymph nodes. Moreover,
we used these approaches to study how innate cell MEs change during distinct types of inflammation (Type-I
vs. Type-II), and which MEs are associated with distinct types of T cell effector programming. We found that the
generation of highly divergent innate MEs is involved in programing of Type-I vs. Type-II T cell responses. We
also demonstrated that activation of T cells within distinct innate MEs leads to very rapid early heterogeneity in
the developing adaptive immune response. These findings raise the central hypothesis of the current follow-up
proposal, that lymphoid tissues are composed of a mosaic of innate MEs, which dynamically respond to
specific inflammatory stimuli, and which are directly involved in the generation of distinct programs of
T cell immunity. The Objectives and corresponding Specific Aims of this renewal proposal are: 1) to continue
characterizing the cellular and molecular signaling events involved in the generation of innate cell MEs during
Type-I inflammation; 2) to elucidate the roles of lymphatic drainage mediated antigen and agonist dispersal
across lymphoid tissues in the establishment of diverse innate MEs and the generation of downstream adaptive
response heterogeneity, and 3) to determine the impact of paracrine cell-cell signaling in driving the formation of
Type-II MEs and Th2 cell differentiation (Aim 3). Our rationale is that a better understanding of how lymphoid
tissue microanatomy impacts innate and adaptive cell crosstalk during distinct types of inflammation, will help
reveal the underlying principles of immune response generation to vaccines and infections. A long-term goal of
our studies is to use this information to develop novel approaches to manipulate immune responses directly in
vivo. This would have major ramifications and clinical significance in improving human health."
10758214,"Project Summary/Abstract
Around birth, mammals undergo the most complex and profound physiologic and metabolic changes for
adaptations to the extrauterine life. Intriguingly, this process is accompanied with loss of tissue regenerative
potential in many organs including the heart, skin and brain. The upstream signals that drive the perinatal loss
of organ regenerative capacity are largely unknown. Our study of heart regeneration suggests that activation of
thermogenic pathways such as the perinatal increase of circulating thyroid hormone levels and adrenergic
receptor activity during the ectotherm-to-endotherm transition inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferative potential and
heart regeneration in ontogeny and phylogeny (Hirose et al., Science 2019; Payumo et al., Circulation 2021).
Following this direction, we recently made preliminary yet intriguing observations that another thermogenic
pathway also regulates mammalian cardiomyocyte renewal potential. In this proposal, we will investigate
whether thermogenic tissues control mammalian cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest after birth. Their impact on
cardiomyocyte regeneration and heart repair after myocardial infarction will also be determined in adult mice.
Furthermore, the signaling molecules mediating the thermogenic organ-heart crosstalk will be examined.
Collectively, our proposed experiments will shed lights into the molecule mechanism and fundamental principle
governing the loss of organ regenerative capacity after the acquisition of endothermy."
10763808,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity/type 2 diabetes.
Strict glycemic control in recent large-scale clinical trials failed to demonstrate cardiovascular mortality benefit in
type 2 diabetic patients. Novel strategies capable of protecting the heart against diabetes-exacerbated post-
myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling are urgently needed. Research in the past decade has increased
understanding of the roles adipocytes (ADp) play in health and disease. Functional ADp are critical in maintaining
systemic metabolic hemostasis, whereas ADp dysfunction is one of the most recognized pathogenic factors
leading to obesity/type 2 diabetes. The cardiomyocyte (CM) is the most important cell type maintaining heart
function. Its failure is the direct cause of diabetic cardiac death. Complete understanding of the molecular
mechanisms mediating the adverse communication between diabetic ADp (the culprit of obesity-induced
diabetes) and diabetic CM (the victim in which injury most significantly contributes to diabetic cardiovascular
death) will certainly help development of effective therapies against diabetic cardiovascular death. Extracellular
vesicles, particularly exosomes (Exo), are critical agents in remote organ communication. Our most recently
published study demonstrates for the first time that diabetes causes significant ADp Exo dysfunction, switching
ADp-Exo from cargo-carrying cardioprotective molecules to vehicles delivering cardiotoxic molecules from ADp
to CM, critically contributing to diabetic cardiac injury. Our preliminary data further demonstrate that diabetic CM
lose protective response to non-diabetic ADp-Exo, while uptake of diabetic ADp-Exo significantly increases.
Several in vivo and in vitro experiments strongly suggest that diabetes-induced CM adiponectin receptor-1
(AdipoR1) phosphorylation is a central mechanism switching Exo-mediated ADp-CM communication from a
receptor/intracellular salvage kinase activation system to a vehicle delivering toxic ADp-Exo into diabetic CM,
enhancing post-MI remodeling and accelerating heart failure. This novel hypothesis will be rigorously
investigated by utilizing multiple tissue-specific genetically manipulated animals and pharmacological
interventions. Specific Aim 1 will clarify the critical role of diabetes-induced CM AdipoR1 phosphorylation in
blocking ADp-Exo mediated cardioprotection. Specific Aim 2 will test a hypothesis that diabetes-induced CM
AdipoR1 phosphorylation promotes toxic ADp-Exo endocytosis. Specific Aim 3 will prove a concept that diabetes-
induced CM AdipoR1 phosphorylation plays a causative role in diabetic ADp-Exo mediated cardiac injury.
Successful completion of these studies will reveal a novel molecular mechanism responsible for diabetic
exacerbation of cardiac injury, and potentially identify novel therapy against post-MI remodeling in diabetic
patients. Moreover, successful completion of the proposed studies may have broader implications in the
development of other diseases involving Exo, as our work will help to fill a knowledge gap concerning cell/tissue
selective recognition of circulating Exo."

Direct cardiac reprogramming holds great promise as a novel therapy for heart failure, a common and morbid
disease that is usually caused by irreversible loss of massive functional cardiomyocytes. By leveraging the
knowledge in developmental and stem cell biology gained during my PhD and postdoc training, in 2012 I
demonstrated that in a murine acute myocardial infarction model, delivery of three transcription factors, Gata4,
Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT) converted cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into functional induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) that
integrated electrically and mechanically with surrounding myocardium, resulting in functional improvement and
scar size reduction. These findings suggest that iCM reprogramming is an effective means of regenerating heart
tissue in vivo for human patients with heart disease. However, because relatively little was known about the
factors that allow CFs to be reprogrammed, the applicability of cardiac reprogramming was limited to the context
in which it had been attempted at that time. Since my independence, my own laboratory has established robust
murine and human iCM reprogramming systems. By using these systems, we obtained novel insights into the
transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of both murine iCM (supported by R01HL128331
as ESI) and human iCM reprogramming (supported by R01HL144551), and concomitantly improved the quality
and yield of iCMs. This R35 EIA application is an extension to these two currently funded NHLBI R01 grants to
further unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying iCM conversion, to test in vivo iCM reprogramming in non-
acutely injured hearts and to exploit the latest single cell multi-omics and mathematical modeling for optimized
and individualized reprogramming. Successful completion of this proposal will help to move direct cardiac
reprogramming closer to its clinical application, provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiac cell fate determination, and open new opportunities for the field to leverage the models and platforms
we will develop here to study other cardiovascular physiological and pathological processes."
10766701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes
(T2DM). Evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program indicates that lifestyle change and metformin use in
this population are clinically equivalent, each reducing the incidence of T2DM by approximately 50% among
women with a GDM history. These women face a preference-sensitive decision between the evidence-based
alternatives. Shared decision making (SDM) is an attractive approach in this situation, using a decision aid to
make the decision explicit, describe the available options with equipoise, elicit patient preferences, and help
patients make an informed decision that is right for them. To our knowledge, there are no existing studies
evaluating SDM for diabetes prevention among women with a history of GDM.
Our team has extensive experience with a team-based SDM approach for diabetes prevention, and our prior
work showed that this approach leads to increased uptake of an evidence-based diabetes prevention strategy
(lifestyle change, metformin or both) as well as sustained weight loss at 12-month follow-up in a broader
population with prediabetes. We have also completed a pilot test of SDM among 33 women with a GDM
history, demonstrating feasibility and acceptability. In this proposal, we aim to evaluate SDM for diabetes
prevention among women with a history of GDM and prediabetes within two health systems (UCLA and
Intermountain). Pharmacists will implement the intervention at UCLA, and clinic care managers will implement
the intervention at Intermountain. Our Specific Aims are as follows: To test the effectiveness of an RCT
evaluating SDM for diabetes prevention on 1) weight loss among overweight/obese women with a history of
GDM and hemoglobin A1c between 5.7-6.4%, 2) uptake of lifestyle change and/or metformin use, patient-
reported outcomes (physical activity, eating patterns, patient activation, health-related quality of life), annual
follow-up screening for progression to T2DM, and rates of GDM in a subsequent pregnancy (exploratory

Metastasis remains a major obstacle in the treatment of breast cancer. A key contributor to metastasis is the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. During EMT, cancer cells gain mesenchymal, migratory,
invasive, and stem cell properties. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles in metastatic progression, cancer
recurrence, and chemoresistance. There is an urgent need for CSC-targeting therapies to combat recurrence
and prevent metastasis. The premiere strategy to exploit the vulnerabilities of CSCs is to identify essential factors
that support the stemness phenotype. Recent research has shown that the EMT process does not move cells
between the binary “epithelial” and “mesenchymal” states. Instead, it is a continuum, and the cells can maintain
both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics (hybrid E/M) and possess high cellular plasticity and stemness.
During EMT, changes in intermediate filaments, particularly upregulation of the mesenchymal-associated
filament protein vimentin, have been documented. However, the role of vimentin in EMT and stemness and the
consequence of co-expression of vimentin and cytokeratin (CK) in hybrid E/M cells with high stemness are not
known. Besides, the function of vimentin is regulated through dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
on critical sites, also known as “vimentin phospho-malleability. Preliminary data show that inhibiting phospho-
malleability of vimentin serine-56 (S56) inhibits stemness and induces multinucleation in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells. It does not affect cancer cells with epithelial phenotypes, which do not express vimentin,
or fibroblasts, which only express vimentin. Among the various phosphorylation sites, the phospho-malleability
of S56 alone can induce multinucleation and inhibit stemness. Therefore, we hypothesize that vimentin S56
phospho-malleability is critical for maintaining the stemness of carcinoma cells expressing vimentin,
and it is a driver of metastasis. Interfering with vimentin S56 phosphorylation will result in selective
elimination of CSCs, inhibition of metastasis, and increased chemo-sensitivity. We propose the following
aims to test this hypothesis: (1) Characterize how vimentin S56 phospho-malleability influences EMT and stem
cell properties. (2) Define how the interaction between phospho-malleable vimentin and CK affects stemness in
hybrid E/M cells with plasticity. (3) Determine the importance of vimentin S56 phospho-malleability on
metastasis. Through innovative experiments using hybrid E/M cell lines, we will identify signaling pathways and
vimentin-interacting proteins in the context of vimentin S56 phospho-malleability. Using patient TNBC samples,
syngeneic tumor xenografts, and human patient-derived xenografts, we will demonstrate the biological
importance of vimentin S56 phospho-malleability for stemness in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Understanding the
importance of vimentin S56 phospho-malleability and the impact of impairing this will aid in developing novel
EMT and CSC-targeting therapies to treat metastasis-prone TNBCs."
10728331,"Background: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to kill over 23,000 Americans yearly. Overuse of antibiotics is a leading cause, and
reducing unnecessary antibiotic use is a national priority. A major factor in antibiotic overuse is
inappropriate or unnecessary culturing, particularly unnecessary urine culturing that identifies
colonization and leads to overdiagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI).
Significance/ Impact: Diagnostic stewardship is a novel approach to limiting antibiotic use by modifying the
ordering, processing, or reporting of a “positive” culture that generally should not be treated. In preliminary
work, we found significant reductions in unnecessary urine cultures and associated antibiotic use through
diagnostic stewardship. Diagnostic stewardship is synergistic with antimicrobial stewardship by improving the
value and accuracy of urine testing before treatment. This proposal addresses gaps including: Defining best
UTI diagnostic stewardship methods, informed by experts and clinicians; developing implementation
methods for UTI diagnostic stewardship; and, assessing the impact of real life UTI diagnostic stewardship—
both benefits and any harms across acute-care, long-term care, and ambulatory care. This meets HSR&D
Research priorities of quality/safety, health care value, cross-cutting HSR methods priorities of
implementation science/provider behavior and ORD-wide priority of real-world impact of VA research in
addition to national priorities from CDC, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the
President’s National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB).
Innovation: Modifying how tests are ordered, processed, and reported can help improve patient care by
using existing technology more effectively. This is a ‘nudge’ approach, developed from psychology and
behavioral economics. This work uses the electronic medical record (EMR) in an innovative, mostly behind
the scenes fashion to improve appropriateness of ordering and reporting of tests. A pragmatic proof-of-
concept study within an existing network of VA health care systems, using automated outcomes from the VA
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is efficient and consistent with the VA goal of being a Learning Health
System.
Our aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Define best UTI diagnostic stewardship criteria, based on literature and Delphi method expert panel.
Aim 2: Use iterative user-centered design process to develop EMR interface and lab protocols, with
clinicians and other stakeholders (nurses, doctors, technicians, and IT representatives).
Aim 3: Conduct a pragmatic proof-of-concept hybrid effectiveness implementation study of the UTI
diagnostic stewardship interventions in 3 CDC-CREATE Network Healthcare Systems evaluating benefits
and any adverse events.
Project Methods: Aims 1 and 2 will use expert panels for developing consensus criteria and a user-centered
design process, including end-user interviews and focus groups, for creating and refining implementation
tools. Aim 3 will conduct a quasi-experimental before-after study in the existing VA CDC-CREATE Network.
Next Steps/Implementation: Systematic application of diagnostic stewardship has the potential to limit
inappropriate urine culturing; and thereby, reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for over-diagnosed UTI at a
minimal cost and without adverse consequences. If successful, the approaches from this proposal could be
readily implemented to reduce antimicrobial resistance across the VA healthcare system and other hospitals;
reducing catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) and C. difficile rates; and improving the care and safety of
Veterans."
10754513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with, ultimately, irreversible axonal injury
leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Preventing disease progression or treating progressive MS
remains a major unmet clinical need. We have previously developed a novel data-driven model-selection
diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to accurately image inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury,
as well as quantifying axonal loss in the presence of vasogenic edema in experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) and spinal cord injury mice, and brain WM pathologies in MS.
MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, reflecting a weighted-average of signals
between the two compartments. However, our recent observation that DBSI derived axial diffusivity (DBSI-λǁ)
was slightly elevated in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in people with MS (pwMS). This elevated
DBSI-λǁ added uncertainty in assessing whether axonal injury (against the notion that ↓DBSI-λǁ ≈ axonal injury)
is present in NAWM of these pwMS. In this proposed study, we will refine DBSI to further improve its sensitivity
and specificity to axonal injury/loss, demyelination, and inflammation for accurately assessing disease
progression and therapeutic efficacy in pwMS.
Since MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, it reflects a weighted-average between
inter- and intra-axonal signals. In the presence of inflammation-associated edema or minor axonal loss in
pwMS, the longer diffusion time for human scanners coupled with the increased inter-axonal space will lead to
increased DBSI-λǁ masking the detectability of axonal injury. Thus, through separating inter- and intra-axonal
water compartment signals, the sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury of DBSI-derived intra-axonal λ||
(DBSI-IA-λ||) may be improved. This new model will still preserve the isotropic diffusion specificity to
inflammation and tissue loss.
We propose three specific aims to prove or disprove this hypothesis: Aim 1. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA
analyses on autopsy specimens from pwMS followed by conventional histology and immunohistochemical
staining. Aim 2. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA modeling on perfused frog sciatic nerve with and without
contrast agent to separate inter-/intra-axonal space water signal. Aim 3a. To develop a Diffusion Histology
Imaging (DHI) approach combining DBSI/DBSI-IA metrics and machine/deep learning algorithms to
recapitulate histology specificity to MS pathology. Aim 3b. To translate DBSI-IA model to analyze existing DWI
data from the cohort of pwMS previously imaged in an expired program project."
10731743,"Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious
consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that
contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is
suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge
public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other
interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as
they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental
chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk
factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of
commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed
information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art
methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances
[PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and
metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal
growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy
outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that
oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more
depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative
statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional
mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study
sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction
strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude,
sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination,
among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing
health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given
widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely
impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and
beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in
adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute
new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes."

Pancreatic cancer patients show an extremely poor prognosis, which is at least in part due to poor response to
the current standard-of-care chemotherapies. While pancreatic tumors present an inadequate response to
chemotherapy, exposure to chemotherapy leads to development of acquired resistance. The response and
resistance to chemotherapies are modulated by signaling and metabolic alterations in tumor cells and companion
changes in the immune and non-immune stroma. Major advances in (a) understanding signaling responses of
cancer cells and stroma to therapy, (b) understanding metabolic adaptations to signaling and environmental

Pancreatic Cancer (ACPC) intends to achieve these objectives through an integrated research theme that
combined investigations into the metabolic and signaling mediators of acquired resistance in tumor cells and

 During pregnancy, alcohol abuse produces persistent changes in the fetal brain, causing behavioral
impairments throughout life. These conditions are defined as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Most
concerningly, regular binge drinking during pregnancy causes cognitive and socio-behavioral deficits in offspring.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying persistent alcohol-induced neurobehavioral impairments are not
fully understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that alcohol exposure results in CB1 signaling defects in
neonatal mice (P7) that cause neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in adults. Other data also implicate CB1
in the teratogenic effects of alcohol. However, whether synaptic and behavioral deficits are due to alcohol-induced
changes in CB1 and its signaling events within the adult hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions
remains largely unknown. CB1s are mainly expressed in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. They can elicit
cell-type-specific signaling depending on where they are activated and contribute to neuronal and behavior
outcomes. CB1 activity also regulates gene expression via epigenetics; however, the mechanisms are unknown.
Our recent pilot findings suggested that human third-trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure in neonatal mice caused
persistent cognitive and social behavior deficits. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased CB1
expression, histone methylation, and reduced expression of genes essential for synaptic structure and function in
specific neuronal types. These findings suggest that alcohol alters the transcriptional control of gene expression
and synaptic function in a given cell type in the PFC and HP. This proposal will test the hypothesis that a mechanism
underlying synaptic dysfunction in the PFC and HP contributing to behavioral deficits is enhanced CB1 activity and
histone methylation by postnatal alcohol leading to aberrant synaptic gene expression. This proposal will test these
hypotheses in PFC and HP using cell-type-specific (Cre or CreERT2) RiboTag (TRAP) technology to study CB1 and
histone methylation events altered by postnatal alcohol exposure (PAE). We will pay special attention to evidence
of aberrant regulation of histone methylation responsive genes related to spine and synaptic vesicle function.
Additionally, we will investigate the role of histone methylation on synaptic structure and function by conditional
deletion (cKO) of the CB1 gene or a gene encoding a histone-methylation-related enzyme (FloxP lines) in the
specific neuronal type (CreERT2) in the adult PFC and HP. Finally, we will mechanistically test the effects of
modulating histone methylation levels using cKO of CB1 or histone methylation enzyme function in specific neuronal
types to rescue adult cognitive and social behaviors. These studies will use sex-dependent models to perform a
combined epigenetic, synaptic, and behavioral analysis of the response to PAE. Our goals in this proposal are to
identify the mechanisms underlying the long-lasting changes in CB1 and histone-methylation-related transcriptional
and synaptic changes in the PFC and HP and determine their contributions to the persistent cognitive and socio-
behavioral deficits resulting from PAE. The findings will elucidate pathways and provide possible novel targets for
therapeutic intervention in PAE-related neurological disease."

Although mechanical overloading of joints has been implicated in the comorbid association between obesity
and osteoarthritis (OA) [1, 2], we and others have established a pathogenic role for obesity-associated
inflammation [3-6]. Our work to further study inflammation in this context has led to new data implicating
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome as a root cause of inflammation in the colon, circulation, and synovium that
culminates in accelerated OA degeneration in joints [7]. Changes include colonic, serum, and synovial
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, which parallel the expansion of Peptococcaceae and
Peptostreptococcaceae family members in the obese gut. Correction of this dysbiosis via dietary
supplementation with the indigestible prebiotic fiber oligofructose ablates these proinflammatory communities
while restoring an Actinobacteria taxa that is lost in obesity, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B.
pseudolongum). This correction leads to reduced inflammation in niches spanning from the colon to the joint,
reduced numbers of macrophages and B cells in the synovium, and protection against the development of OA
in the knee [7]. Moreover, we have discovered that oral delivery of a B. pseudolongum probiotic is joint
protective and the B. pseudolongum metabolome itself contains molecules that directly inhibit inflammation.
Based on these findings, we propose that 1) the OA of obesity is caused by a gut microbiome dysbiosis that
triggers an inflammatory cascade starting in the intestine and radiating to the joint, and 2) obesity-related OA
can be mitigated either by correcting the obese gut dysbiosis using methods to expand B. pseudolongum or by
commandeering its metabolites to reduce inflammation in the colonic epithelium where the obesity-related
inflammatory signature initiates. To investigate these concepts, we propose to address the following two
Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to establish that gut microbiome dysbiosis is causal in the OA of obesity, with the
hypothesis that the obese dysbiotic gut microbiome is the initiator of a systemic inflammatory cascade that
initiates in the colon, radiates to joints, and accelerates OA. Aim 2 is to study how B. pseudolongum protects
against joint degeneration in obesity, with experiments designed to test the hypothesis that B. pseudolongum
mitigates inflammation and is joint protective in the context of obesity and its metabolome contains
inflammation-suppressing agents. Completion of these aims will establish that the OA of obesity is an
inflammatory process driven by gut microbiome dysbiosis. Expansion of B. pseudolongum or delivery of its
metabolites could represent novel therapeutic approaches to address a disease of global scope that is
currently only treated palliatively."

 Ischemic diseases, including critical limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, afflict millions of people in the
United States. Currently, these diseases are predominately treated by surgical interventions. However, the
inability to regenerate microvascular beds in ischemic tissues remains a challenge. Alternatively, the
development of therapies based on transplanting endothelial cells (ECs) continues to be a priority in vascular
medicine. Unfortunately, engrafting ECs is not trivial. Studies have repeatedly shown that in order to achieve
significant engraftment resulting in functional new blood vessels, ECs require co-transplantation with supporting
cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, this paradigm is problematic because it increases
the complexity of clinical trials exponentially. Previously, we have published extensively on all aspects of human
EC+MSC engraftment. However, the underlying mechanisms by which MSCs facilitate EC engraftment remain
incompletely understood. Recently, we found that upon implantation, MSCs transfer mitochondria to ECs via
tunneling nanotubes and that when this transfer was genetically abrogated, EC engraftment was drastically
impaired. Based on this insight, we propose a new concept: artificially transplanting mitochondria into human
ECs as a means to preemptively enhance their ability to engraft without a secondary cell type. Indeed, our
preliminary data show that transplanting exogenous mitochondria into ECs renders the cells (termed mitoT-ECs)
capable of forming functional vessels in vivo in ischemic tissues, without the support of MSCs. We also found
that transplanted mitochondria co-localized with LC3B-marked autophagosomes and that genetic ablation of
PINK1 and Parkin (both central players in mitophagy) eliminated the enhanced engraftment ability of mitoT-ECs.
Together, our overarching hypothesis is that transplanting exogenous mitochondria into ECs renders transient
cytoprotection via mitophagy; this, in turn, enhances the engraftment ability of the cells. To test this hypothesis
and to determine the efficacy of mitoT-ECs to treat ischemic diseases, we propose two specific aims. In Aim-1,
we will determine conditions (e.g., concentration and timing) for optimal EC engraftment in immunodeficient mice.
We will dissect the role of mitophagy and will examine the fate and persistence of the transplanted mitochondria.
We will also determine if selective drugs with mitophagy-enhancing properties could also enhance EC
engraftment. In Aim-2, we will determine the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation-enabled EC therapy in two
well-established models of ischemic diseases: critical hind limb ischemia (in mice) and myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury (in rats). In summary, we propose studies to develop a novel approach to engraft
ECs more successfully. We envision this research could become the basis for a new strategy in vascular cell
therapies."

Understanding how endogenously-generated adult-born neurons functionally integrate into neural circuits may
inform strategies employing stem cell-derived neurons to repair damaged brain areas. Olfactory sensory neurons
(OSNs), which are generated throughout life in all mammals, provide an ideal model to study functional
integration in both the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. Our long-term goal is to determine how
circuit function and regeneration can be enhanced by functional integration of newborn neurons. The overall
objective of this application is to determine how evoked activity during an immature developmental window
influences OSN survival and integration in the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. Our central
hypothesis is that odor selective input to immature OSNs is required for their survival and functional integration
in both the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific
aims. First, we will define the odor selectivity of immature OSN sensory input to the OB, using in vivo 2-photon
calcium imaging. Second, we will determine the role of evoked activity in immature adult-born OSNs in their
survival and functional integration. We will up- and down-regulate evoked activity in OSNs during the immature
developmental stage, and use immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, optogenetics and in vivo 2-photon
structural and functional imaging to assay their survival, synaptogenesis and functional integration. Finally, we
will determine the role of immature OSN activity in regeneration of OSN input to the OB. For this aim, we will
chemically ablate OSNs, which regenerate from olfactory epithelium stem cells, manipulate activity using naris
occlusion and chemogenetic silencing during regeneration, and use in vivo 2-photon time-lapse imaging to track
structural and functional regeneration of OSN input to glomeruli. We expect to find that evoked activity during
immaturity plays a key role in the survival and integration of that OSN. Hence, our proposed work will have an
important impact by defining how functional integration of an endogenous population of stem cell-derived
neurons is regulated to maintain and regenerate brain function. This study will be highly significant in elucidating
the role of activity in an endogenously-generated population of newborn neurons in regulating their functional
integration, thereby providing important insight relevant to the development of stem cell-based therapeutic
strategies to repair damaged neural circuits. Our proposed research is conceptually innovative in proposing that
sensory input during the immature phase of development is crucial to successful functional integration of OSNs
in the healthy and regenerating OB and will employ a technically innovative array of experimental approaches."

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of life-threatening coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral
arterial disease in the United States. Notably, dyslipidemia remains a major risk factor despite effective lipid-
lowering therapies and prevention programs. This is, in part, due to overwhelming arterial inflammation that
drives the transition from a stable to vulnerable and rupture-prone atheroma. The lack of effective therapies to
lower circulating cholesterol while forcefully curbing arterial inflammation during atheroma progression
presents an opportunity to develop innovative, new medicines for this devastating disease. Understanding the
causative molecular mechanisms responsible for dyslipidemia and arterial inflammation should provide for the
rapid development of more potent therapeutic approaches. Our long-term goal is to uncover molecular
mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and unearth fresh potential therapeutic targets. Much of our
earlier research has centered on examining the role of epsin endocytic adaptor proteins in endothelial cells and
macrophages to regulate progression of atherogenesis. We have demonstrated that epsins 1 and 2 are
upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques in mouse models of atherosclerosis and human atherosclerotic lesions.
Consequently, deletion of epsins in the endothelium and macrophages resulted in marked attenuation of
atherogenesis. Mechanistically, we showed that epsins escalate arterial inflammation by expressing adhesion
molecules, enhancing monocyte recruitment, and hindering efferocytosis. More recently, we created a liver-
specific deficiency of epsins in an atherosclerotic mouse model and found that atherogenesis was greatly
inhibited and accompanied with diminished blood cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels. Therefore, targeting
epsins, their binding partners, and downstream targets represents an attractive therapeutic approach to
resolve both chronic vascular inflammation and dyslipidemia associated with atheroma development. In this
new application, our proposal builds on compelling evidence that epsins contribute to hyperlipidemia by
enhancing sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activity to promote cholesterol
synthesis as well as increasing low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation to perturb oxidized lipid
clearance in the liver. By targeting liver epsins using nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNAs, we hope to design a
novel therapeutic strategy to impede dyslipidemia in atherosclerosis. We will investigate the following Specific
Aims using unique mutant mice, in vitro models, and novel reagents: 1) to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which liver epsins regulate SREBPs in atherosclerosis, 2) to determine the molecular
mechanisms of liver epsin-mediated downregulation of LDLR in atherosclerosis, and 3) to determine the
therapeutic potential of targeting liver epsins for atheroma resolution. If fruitful, our findings will uncover original
roles for liver epsins in fueling hyperlipidemia in atherosclerosis, offer a new class of therapeutic strategies for
treating this disease, and inaugurate a paradigm shift in research relevant to fighting cardiovascular disease."

 We propose to advance our understanding of the key factors involved in the distribution of blood within the
brain. Our focus begins with the relation of flow dynamics to the topology of the underlying angioachitecture. In
cortex, a highly interconnected network of surface vessels and a network of subsurface vasculature were
shown to be effective in distributing blood and in providing a robust immunity to occlusions. In contrast, the
penetrating arterioles that shuttle blood from the cortical surface to the underlying microvessels were shown to
be a bottleneck to the supply of blood within the brain and a locus for cognitive decline after a microstroke. We
will determine if other brain areas follow the same vascular plan or rather have a different set of design rules.
Our initial emphasis is on hippocampus, given the great sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to ischemia.
 While the topology of the vasculature is fixed, the diameter and thus the resistance to flow of individual can
change. First, the diameter of brain blood vessels changes with vasomotion at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. It is not
known if this slow signal phase-locks to vasomotion in a distant region or in the contralateral hemisphere that is
also activated by a common stimulus. We will determine the effects of awake sensory stimulation on
vasomotion along pathways over large regions of cortex. The finding of activity induced correlation of
vasomotion should have implications as a basis for the functional connectivity derived by bold oxygenation
level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonant imaging (fMRI). A second aspect of neurovascular
signaling concerns changes in diameter in arterioles and potentially microvascular capillaries in response to
modulators released by stimulus-induced neural activity. The mechanism by which neural activity leads to both
vasoconstriction and to vasodilation is a puzzle. We will determine the competitive nature of vasoactive
signaling by concomitant measure of extrasynaptic modulator concentration and activation of specific neuronal
subtypes in terms of their affects on changing blood flow through vasoconstriction or vasodilation.
 We note that all of the proposed experiments make use of a broad range of technologies, ranging from
behavior to physiology to probes to imaging, and thus provide a fertile test bed for scientific discovery as well
as a means to train the next generation of neuroscientists as generalists."
10815694,"NE-CAT operates two mature, state-of-the-art beamlines optimized for macromolecular crystallography at
the APS. The goal of the Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) Core is to provide user access to these
facilities, to maintain the facilities, and to make improvements so that NE-CAT remains state-of-the-art. The
most important component for providing access is user support and training. User support requires about
four FTEs, made up by contributions from eight staff scientists. About two FTEs are devoted to user training
and outreach, and about two FTEs, to beamline hardware and software maintenance and development. The
MX Core provides access 24/7, either on-site or on-call, for both on-site and remote users. It maintains
hardware and software for accurate, high speed data collection, including crystal screening, SAD/MAD
phasing, molecular replacement phasing, high resolution data acquisition, and methods for obtaining data
from challenging (""pathological"") crystals. NE-CAT provides stable, small X-ray beams for a variety of
microbeam applications. Special scanning techniques allow the user to ameliorate crystal damage, locate
crystals in opaque media, and assess the quality of localized regions within larger, inhomogeneous crystals.
The MX Core also provides full access to RAPD, NE-CAT’s automated data collection and analysis
software. The MX Core will maintain existing beamline hardware and software at peak performance,
through a well-defined, long-term plan for providing routine maintenance of motion control systems, critical
vacuum and ultrahigh vacuum pumps, and monochromator cryopumps. The MX Core will also maintain
computer clusters, beamline and data analysis computers, disk storage systems, and network
infrastructure. Certain improvements will be essential for keeping NE-CAT facilities at state-of-the-art.
These fall into three areas: (1) beamline optics and instrumentation, (2) computing infrastructure, and (3)
RAPD software. Plans for beamline optics include installation of a ganged channel-cut monochromator on
24-ID-C and installation of new MD3 goniometers on both beamlines. These modifications and
improvements are compatible with the APS upgrade, scheduled to begin 2023. The upgrade program
includes 12 months without X-rays, which presents a superb opportunity for rebuilding our nearly 20-year-
old beamlines for another 20 years of operation. Computing upgrades include addition of faster nodes to the
compute clusters and additional disk storage for data collection, and upgrades. We will implement new
externally developed data processing and analysis routines in RAPD, to maintain state-of-the-art

Approximately 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy (RT), but local recurrence can still occur
even with the use of advanced RT techniques. This local recurrence, which commonly develops in 30-50% of
cancer cases, is exacerbated by the acquisition of RT resistance. This RT resistance is especially true for
patients with locally advanced thoracic cancers, such as lung and esophageal cancers. RT can lead to an iron-
dependent cell death modality, called ferroptosis, but whether ferroptosis resistance occurs within tumors giving
rise to acquired RT resistance is not known and is the central theme of the proposed Acquired Resistance to
Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. The overarching goals of the ARTI Center are: 1) to bridge the basic science
mechanisms of ferroptosis in acquired resistance with translational research in preclinical models and human
patient samples; 2) to identify cohorts of patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired RT resistance;
and 3) to investigate the ability of novel therapeutic agents to re-sensitize lung and esophageal cancer cells to
radiation by inducing ferroptosis. The ARTI Center comprises two basic/mechanistic projects (Project 1 and
Project 2), one preclinical/translational project (Project 3), and one shared resource core (Molecular Imaging
Core [MIC]). Project 1 will focus on elucidating whether ferroptosis evasion is a key driver in acquired RT
resistance using radioresistant lung cancer and esophageal cancer cell lines and xenograft models that will be
used in Project 2. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that hypoxia, a long-recognized driver of tumor
radioresistance, suppresses ferroptosis induction during RT and contributes to RT-induced acquired resistance
to ferroptosis. Furthermore, expression of hypoxia-related genes and other targets of acquired RT resistance will
be analyzed by single-cell sequencing in Project 3. Project 3 investigates changes in immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment of humanized tumor models derived from chemoradiation therapy-responsive or -non-
responsive esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. These ferroptosis-mediated immunologic changes in the
tumor microenvironment may serve as prognostic biomarkers for identifying tumors that may acquire RT
resistance and predicting cancer patient outcomes, which could, in the future, be modulated by the ferroptosis-
inducing agents tested in Projects 1 and 2. Projects 1, 2, and 3 will be supported by the MIC that utilizes
bioluminescence imaging to monitor tumor growth, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to monitor
cystine transporter activity and to identify hypoxic regions within tumors, as well as novel, redox-tuned PET
tracers for identifying activated innate immune cells. The ARTI Center will develop an Administrative Core for
effective communication and collaboration between the ARTI Center Project and Core Leaders and Co-Leaders
with National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet) program staff as well
as other ARTNet centers to synergize ARTI Center-related activities."

10733432,"This proposal is designed to provide circuit-dynamics understanding of anhedonia, a psychiatric symptom
domain of enormous clinical significance that is well-suited for study in laboratory animals. This work,
alongside our recently-developed methods for obtaining brainwide cellular-resolution activity readout and
control, has created a powerful and fortuitous alignment enabling us to bridge local and global neuronal
dynamics, and to identify brain-spanning circuitry mediating behavioral drives, conflicts, and resolutions.
 In Aim 1, we identify single-cell-resolved orbitofrontal (OFC) dynamics underlying distinct consummatory
behaviors. We have developed a temporally-precise alternative-choice mouse-behavioral paradigm, crucially
designed for compatibility with our wide-field cellular-resolution imaging/recording methods, in which mice
select among multiple motivational drives, and adjust action planning in light of internal or external context.
We apply this paradigm along with our cellular-resolution readouts and analyses, beginning with addressing
both hunger and thirst in OFC. We identify dynamics of motivational drive resolution both in the presence or
absence of controlled internal states, and in the presence or absence of external (social) context, using our new
methods; we hypothesize from prior work (Jennings et al., Nature 2019) that resolution of these conflicts will
depend upon not only the motivational (internal) state of the animal but also the external context.
 In Aim 2, we map causal global dynamics of motivational drive conflict and resolution, quantifying the
high-speed cellular-resolution brainwide circuit dynamics underlying these motivational drive interactions
(drives naturally-occurring; or, to leverage our fast electrophysiological readout, instead induced in temporally-
precise fashion by optogenetically driving AGRP neurons in the case of hunger, and/or SFO inputs to the
MnPO in the case of thirst, using our established models and methods; Allen et al., Science 2019; Jennings et
al., Nature 2019; Marshel et al., Science 2019). Identification of novel region-specific dynamics in conditions of
varying motivational drive and social context will feed back to inform Aim 1 imaging workflow, already with a
firm foundation from our prior work imaging OFC states corresponding to social and thirst drive interaction.
 In Aim 3, we define cells underlying inter-drive competition and corresponding brainwide dynamics.
Multiple single cells identified by natural activity will be optogenetically targeted with our unique wide-field
and high-resolution spatial light-guidance technology. We register cellular ensembles observed to be naturally
and causally involved, to detailed 3D intact-tissue (STARmap) transcriptomic information from the same cells
in the same organism. Alignment with wiring-based anatomy and deep molecular datastreams allow cell-type-
resolved and single cell-level insight into, and targeting of, survival drive competition and resolution processes,
with both basic significance and relevance to brain disease. Together, the approaches proposed here will
integrate novel technology to probe causal underpinnings of key symptom domains in freely-moving mammals."
10843878,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mammalian tissue development requires a series of tightly regulated and dynamic fluctuations
in metabolic pathways, growth factor signaling, gene expression, and cofactor availability. An
important cofactor is copper (Cu), an essential but toxic trace nutrient that is required for oxidative
phosphorylation, removal of reactive oxygen species, iron homeostasis, and pro-survival
signaling pathways. Cu is important for normal tissue development, and we and others have
shown that Cu is required for differentiation of skeletal muscle and neuronal cells. This need for
Cu is highlighted by the severe postnatal developmental impairment in cases of Cu deficiency
including profound hypotonia and neurodegeneration. Menkes is a fatal genetic Cu deficiency
disease caused by mutations in ATP7A, which encodes a trans-Golgi Cu transporting ATPase.
Several open questions remain about the critical Cu targets during tissue differentiation and how
regulated gene expression contributes to prioritized Cu distribution to those targets. These
questions create a gap in knowledge of Cu handling that limit the development of therapies to
treat Cu diseases including Menkes. Our preliminary data indicate that ATP7A is required for
skeletal muscle cell differentiation and that Cu and ATP7A may contribute to regulated inhibition
of TGF- signaling pathways that prevent differentiation. We also discovered that post-
transcriptional regulation of the Atp7a RNA contributes to differentiation-dependent tuning of
ATP7A expression. The proposed research program includes two projects to understand
prioritization of Cu during skeletal muscle differentiation by first focusing on function and
regulation of ATP7A. The first project will study the role of Cu and ATP7A in modulating TGF-
signaling to promote differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The second will focus on uncovering the
mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of Atp7a RNA and how they control ATP7A
expression. These projects will identify new signaling pathways regulated by Cu and new
mechanisms of Cu regulation. This work will open the possibility of modulating Cu availability by
targeting post-transcriptional regulatory pathways and raise the possibility of controlling TGF-
signaling by manipulating Cu availability to treat Cu-related and developmental disease."

10750942,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Touch contributes powerfully to parent-infant interactions that are fundamental for early social development.
Among the most developed sensory modalities when infants are born, touch continues to play a critical role in
communication and social interaction throughout development and adult life. Abnormalities in tactile perception
are prevalent features in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), exacerbating the core social deficits.
While the relationship between tactile sensory processing and social behaviors have been studied extensively
using psychophysical paradigms from clinical perspectives, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying their link, and how they facilitate the development of one another. Understanding how social features
are encoded alongside early tactile sensory inputs will provide valuable insights into the emergence of circuits
integrating primary sensory processing and higher-order cognitive features.
 Through three distinct aims, we propose to leverage longitudinal two-photon imaging, genetic tools and behavioral
assays to determine how oxytocin, a neuropeptide critical in a wide range of social behaviors, modulates superficial
interneuronal circuits to facilitate the development of social touch. We choose to focus on the circuits involving L1
reelin-expressing (L1 Re) interneurons due to their unique connectivity and function in restricting pyramidal neuron
activation during sensory input in early postnatal days. In Aim 1, we will survey the neuronal types that express
oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) in the superficial layers of the barrel cortex, and determine the function of oxytocin in
modulating circuits involving L1 Re interneurons. In Aim 2, we will examine the in vivo neuronal activity in neonatal
mouse pups during dam induced social touch, and determine how disruption in oxytocin signaling in L1 Re
interneurons affects this activity. In Aim 3, we will extend our investigation on the role of oxytocin in the emergence of
social touch to cover the entire developmental time period from neonatal stage to adulthood by performing longitudinal
two-photon imaging, completed with long-term behavioral assessment of social interaction over this time span.
Together, these aims will reveal how interneurons shape social interaction, providing a framework that can help
refine therapeutic directions for treating symptoms of ASD as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders.
 By addressing these questions and carrying out the proposed work, the candidate will build both technical and
professional skills that will provide a solid foundation for a future career as an independent researcher. The co-mentors,
Drs. De Marco García and Froemke, will supervise the candidate in formal aspects of conceptual design and
experimental methods through regular meetings (see Training Plan) and also advise and support the candidate in the
process of securing a faculty position, setting up an independent lab, and securing initial funding. The Advisory
Committee, which consists of Drs. Liston, Lee and Rajadhyaksha, who have extensive experience with the methods
outlines in the Research Strategy, will provide consultation on both the conduct and interpretation of the research and

10749869,"Project Summary
Cancer pain is complex, prevalent and has serious consequences for patients, family caregivers and
healthcare systems. Inadequately managed cancer pain can be particularly problematic for patients coping
with advanced, metastatic disease. Most symptom management occurs in the home setting, and family
caregivers often play a key role in helping to manage cancer pain, but often find this task daunting and
stressful. Complicating cancer pain management is the reality that opioids, a main-stay class of medications
used to control serious cancer pain, are subject to increased scrutiny given well-publicized concerns about the
national `opioid epidemic.' Now more than ever, it is imperative we understand how patients and family
caregivers attempt to manage cancer pain at home so we can offer them personalized support to effectively
and safely alleviate pain. Mobile and wireless technology (`smart health') can help support symptom
management in the home setting, but must be carefully designed to account for the realities of patients and
family caregivers coping with advanced disease. We hypothesize that individuals, and patient-family caregiver
dyads, will display a unique `digital fingerprint' (or phenotype) of the advanced cancer pain experience – that if
better understood can be utilized to inform and deliver personalized, timely interventions. The purpose of this
study, which builds upon preliminary pilot work, is to deploy an unobtrusive smart health system, the
Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Cancer (BESI-C), to monitor and describe – and
ultimately to predict and help manage – the experience of advanced cancer pain in the home setting. BESI-C is
comprised of wearable (smart watch) and environmental sensors that collect physiological, behavioral, and
contextual data at the individual, dyad and home level that can be integrated to provide a comprehensive
picture of a health related phenomenon. A unique feature of the BESI-C system is the ability of patients and
caregivers to record and characterize cancer pain events from their own perspective using a custom
application on their respective smart watch. Specifically, this observational research will analyze data collected
via BESI-C from patient-family caregiver dyads recruited from an outpatient oncology palliative care clinic and
a home hospice program, to develop comprehensive `digital phenotypes' of advanced cancer pain in the home
setting. These digital phenotypes will characterize the frequency, intensity and impact on quality of life of pain
events; monitor the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies and self-reported
effectiveness; correlate environmental, contextual, behavioral and physiological sensor data with reported pain
events; and evaluate concordance of patient and caregiver data. This research will also explore preferences
for communicating collected data with patients, family caregivers and healthcare providers by creating and
sharing data visualizations. Additionally, we will explore which sensing data are most predictive of
breakthrough pain events to build parsimonious pain prediction algorithms."
10857176,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Overview:
 The overarching goal of the UTSW NORC is to enhance research efforts in nutrition and obesity by
facilitating interdisciplinary interactions to speed translation of basic scientific discoveries into clinically relevant
interventions in humans that improve public health. We have assembled a highly interactive and collaborative
interdisciplinary team of investigators at UT Southwestern that harnesses expertise from diverse disciplines,
with a goal of defining the behavioral, metabolic, genetic, and molecular mechanisms contributing to obesity
and obesity-induced disease.
 The UTSW NORC research base consists of 158 investigators from 27 different Departments. These
investigators have 230 extramurally funded nutrition/obesity-related research grants that total more than $74
million/yr in direct costs. To facilitate interdisciplinary research and the exchange of ideas, our NORC has
created the following thematically related Teams: Team 1: Central Regulation of Energy Metabolism; Team 2:
Adipocyte Biology and Energy Metabolism; Team 3: Obesity-induced Peripheral Organ Disease; and Team 4:
Nutrition, Obesity, and Cancer. Within each team, we have integrated scientists from a wide spectrum of
disciplines to comprehensively address the biochemical, metabolic, and clinical consequences of obesity and
related diseases. Each Team has a mixture of senior, mid-level, and junior scientists, which will enhance the
development of junior scientists and increase the likelihood of successful collaborations. The P&F program will
support four new investigators/year who will also be assigned to one of the four research Teams.
 To support our research efforts, we have established four cores and a Clinical Element to provide state-of-
the art services that exceed the capabilities, availability and/or budgets of individual NORC investigators. The
Animal Phenotyping/Metabolism Core provides an extensive array of blood metabolites and hormones, 50+
metabolic cages, telemetry measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, core body temperature, and activity,
multiple imaging modalities to characterize fat distribution, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and
primary cell isolation. The Lipid Mass Spectrometry Core provides comprehensive quantification of lipids in
cells, tissues, and blood. The Quantitative Metabolism and Imaging Core provides sophisticated flux
measurements of metabolic pathways in vivo and 1H imaging and spectroscopy to characterize skeletal muscle
and liver lipid content in humans. The Genetics, Single Cell Sequencing & RNA seq core provides exome
sequencing and gene expression and analysis. All cores provide services for animal and human research,
supporting the ability to translate findings more rapidly from animal models into testable hypothesis in humans.
 The UTSW NORC provides an important mechanism for a large group of diverse investigators to coalesce
and focus their research efforts related to nutrition and obesity to accelerate translation of basic scientific
discoveries into clinically relevant interventions in humans to improve public health."
10876237,"Aging is the primary risk factor for debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Can manipulation of neurons in the brain alter the body’s physiological state to extend lifespan and prevent neurodegenerative disease? Neuropeptides are signaling molecules released by neurons that act through modulatory receptors expressed throughout the brain and body to regulate homeostasis. Whether neuropeptides could control long-term phenotypes such as the rate of aging, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline remains largely unknown. Neuropeptides have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease in humans. For example, the neuropeptide Galanin (GAL) is overexpressed in degenerating brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease, low levels of the neuropeptide Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) are correlated with higher amyloid burden and memory decline, and the number of neurons expressing the neuropeptide Hypocretin are significantly reduced in postmortem hypothalamus of Alzheimer's disease patients. However, a systematic characterization of the role and mode of action of neuropeptides in regulating vertebrate lifespan and their impact on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline is missing. This is largely because aging and lifespan experiments in transgenic vertebrates are slow (3+ years in mice) and low throughput. I will take advantage of a short-lived vertebrate model the African killifish to (1) determine if deletion of key neuropeptides can alter lifespan, healthspan, and cognitive decline, (2) investigate the mode of action of one neuropeptide that I have already found to extend lifespan when knocked out, and (3) test if neuropeptides can act as pro-longevity factors when delivered later in life to counter age-associated cognitive decline. To achieve this, I will use interdisciplinary technologies at the nexus of genetics, aging, and neuroscience. I already have exciting tools and data that support my goal. I built a library of neuropeptide knockout killifish targeting 22 human-conserved neuropeptides using CRISPR/Cas9 and I optimized the protocol for lifespan and healthspan assessment in the killifish. In tantalizing preliminary data, I found that knockout of the AD-associated neuropeptide GAL in killifish results in progressive cognitive decline suggesting that neuropeptides could be key modulators of neurodegeneration in disease such as Alzheimer’s disease. By focusing on diverse neuropeptides that interact with specific druggable receptors, I hope the long-term impact of this work will translate to clinical solutions to age-associated Alzheimer’s disease and others. For the mentored part of my training at Stanford University, I will receive training from my mentor Dr. Karl Deisseroth, co-mentor Dr. Anne Brunet, and an exceptional scientific advisory team with expertise in neuroscience, neuropeptides, aging, neurodegeneration, genetic screening, and CRISPR methods. This work, my technical training, and my career development at Stanford University will provide me with the skills and foundations required to be a leader of a laboratory at a top academic institution, discovering genes critical for longevity and for countering cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease."
10725165,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans, and metastatic disease is overwhelmingly
the predominant cause of death. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that exosomes derived from
highly motile premalignant cells can transfer metastatic phenotypes to neighboring normal cells via paracrine
signaling. In the current Veteran Affairs (VA) Merit Review funding period, we identified and selected a
subpopulation of highly migratory premalignant airway epithelial cells that were observed to migrate through
microscale constrictions at up to 100-fold the rate of the control unselected cells. These highly migratory cells
demonstrate enhanced metastatic behavior in vivo. We isolated and characterized exosomes from these highly
migratory premalignant human airway epithelial cells, as well as, malignant pleural effusion (MPE)-derived
metastatic cancer cells. In both settings of premalignancy and metastatic disease, exosomes containing unique
omic signatures transferred the metastatic phenotype to non-motile cells. From these signatures, we have
identified potential candidates mediating the transfer of metastatic behavior and immunosuppression. To
facilitate the study of metastatic disease, we will utilize our MPE-biobank for exosome isolation and
characterization from individual patient's MPE-derived metastatic lung cancer cells. While exosomes are known
to serve as functional mediators in cell interaction leading to cancer metastasis, this will be the first
comprehensive study to fully characterize the mechanisms underlying these events in the context of pulmonary
premalignant migration, as well as, in the context of metastatic cells from MPEs. In order to characterize and
understand the mechanisms of this process in regulating the promotion of migratory capacity and
immunosuppression in premalignant and metastatic lung cancer cells we will: 1) Determine the capacity of
exosomes to drive disease progression across the spectrum of disease in NSCLC by characterizing the
exosomal cargo derived from premalignant and metastatic cancer cells, 2) Determine the mechanisms of
exosome-dependent promotion of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migratory capacity of epithelial
and lung cancer cells and, 3) determine the mechanisms of exosome-dependent immune suppression. While
exosomes have been reported to serve as functional mediators in cellular interaction leading to cancer
metastasis, this will be the first comprehensive study to fully characterize the mechanisms underlying the full
spectrum of disease, both in the context of pulmonary premalignant migration as well as metastatic lung cancer.
This study of exosome mediated metastatic-modulation in the context of premalignancy and metastasis is unique
and will help define the biology of occult metastasis, provide insights into the phenomenon of parallel
progression, increase the possibility of biomarker discovery and provide targets for lung cancer interception."
10841474,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cis-regulatory long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have the unique capability to regulate the expression of
neighboring genes. Historically studied in the context of dosage compensation, there is mounting evidence that
cis-regulatory lncRNAs may also play widespread roles in normal physiology and disease development.
However, their functions and mechanisms of action have remained poorly characterized. The study proposed
herein aims to understand the role of cis-regulation in cancer biology by focusing on two lncRNAs, lncRNA-
Gadd45 and an alternative isoform of Pvt1, Pvt1b. In preliminary studies, we established that these lncRNAs
are directly regulated by the central tumor suppressor factor p53, that they act in cis to regulate their
neighboring genes, namely the tumor suppressor Gadd45 and the oncogene Myc, and that Pvt1b is involved
in suppressing clonal growth. Based on these exciting data, we have hypothesized that cis-regulatory lncRNAs
provide an unappreciated layer of regulation in the p53 network and may mediate p53-dependent stress
responses and tumor suppressive functions. To address this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we propose to perform a
comprehensive series of experiments at the cellular level, which will test whether genetic inhibition of lncRNA-
Gadd45 and Pvt1b in primary and transformed cell lines affects p53-dependent transcriptional and cellular
responses to stress. In parallel, we will examine whether genetic inhibition of the two lncRNAs in developing
tumors in a mouse model of lung cancer promotes tumor development, as shown for p53. Together, this set of
experiments will establish the physiological relevance of cis-regulatory lncRNAs in the context of the p53
network in vitro and in vivo. In Aims 2 and 3, we will elucidate the mechanism of action of lncRNA-Gadd45
and Pvt1b. Aim 2 applies an innovative genetic approach for transcript-specific degradation, developed by us,
in order to determine the functional element of cis-regulation by dissociating the accumulation of the lncRNA
transcript from the act of its transcription and from the underlying DNA elements in the locus. Findings from this
set of studies will advance the field by clarifying a controversy about the central player in local gene expression
control and may elucidate how cis-regulatory relationships become disrupted in disease states, including
cancer. Finally, in an effort to define universal principles as well as locus-specific features of cis regulation, in
Aim 3, we will determine whether cis-acting lncRNAs impact local transcriptional and epigenetic events by
examining the kinetics of transcription, the epigenetic state, and the chromatin architecture in their respective
loci. In summary, the studies proposed here take advantage of rigorous genetic approaches, elegant functional
assays, and state-of-the art molecular tools to address the contribution of cis-regulatory lncRNAs to the p53
tumor suppressor pathway. The broad significance of this work lies in its potential to expand our understanding
of the transcriptional, epigenetic, and chromatin re-organization events that take place during the physiological
response to stress and become frequently perturbed in cancer."
11127083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Physical activity and weight management are key components of ideal cardiovascular health but many young
adults are insufficiently active and gaining weight rapidly (0.5-1.0 kg/year on average). Physical activity is a
proven strategy for attenuating weight gain so there is a pressing need for effective interventions that reduce
cardiovascular risk by motivating people to move more, sit less, and reduce weight gain. Mobile and wearable
technologies are nearly ubiquitous among young adults and provide access to dense digital data about the
person and their environment. This technology also provides a means of delivering interventions on a just-in-
time basis so each person can receive the right intervention content at the right time. Inspired by the vision of
precision behavioral interventions, we have applied system identification tools from control systems
engineering to develop computational models and algorithms that optimize person-specific dosing of text
messages to promote physical activity. In a series of preliminary studies, we (a) identified weather indices
consistently linked with physical activity, (b) demonstrated the feasibility of long-term activity tracker wear and
the acceptability of text messages among young adults, (c) enriched our computational model of physical
activity using momentary weather data to characterize weather-graded responses to messages, and (d)
designed a controller that uses person-specific parameters from the computational model and data on recent
behavior and forecasted weather conditions to optimize the selection and timing of text message delivery. This
controller is the basis for the Precision Adaptive Intervention Messaging (Precision AIM) intervention. In this
application, we propose a single-site clinical trial to answer question, “Does Precision AIM increase
insufficiently-active young adults’ physical activity and reduce weight gain more than randomly-assigned
intervention messages (Random AIM) from the same message library or an activity tracker with no assigned
intervention messages (No AIM)?” The specific aims of this project are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of Precision
AIM compared to Random AIM and No AIM for increasing physical activity and reducing weight gain in
insufficiently-active young adults, and (2) to identify characteristics of participants who respond more to
Precision AIM than Random AIM or No AIM. We propose a three-arm randomized controlled trial to achieve
these aims. Insufficiently-active young adults will receive a consumer activity tracker and be randomly
assigned to one of three groups: Precision AIM, Random AIM, or No AIM. The intervention period will last for
12 months with a maintenance assessment at 18 months. The primary outcome is average daily step counts
based on accumulating evidence that increasing this readily-interpretable and widely-available metric reduces
cardiovascular risk in adulthood (assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months). If successful, the underlying
algorithmic analyses informed by dense data from wearable devices will provide a new and scalable approach
for using consumer wearables in primordial and primary prevention of cardiovascular risk in young adults."

with ~500,000 cases/year. Cisplatin is the gold standard systemic agent for HNSCC. Cisplatin resistance, both
intrinsic and acquired, has been described in preclinical models and is frequently encountered in clinical practice;
when it occurs it is deadly. The overarching goal of H-CARR is to develop a robust biological understanding
of the key drivers of cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and develop the means of detecting it early in development
and overcoming it once it arises. We previously showed that: 1) cellular processing of cisplatin generated
metabolic stress is a critical driver of sensitivity and/or resistance and 2) coordinated genomic (TP53 mutation)
and transcriptomic (Nrf-2 activation) reprogramming is essential to organizing the metabolic response to cisplatin
generated stress. H-CARR brings together our biological and metabolic models of cisplatin resistance and our
translational capabilities to image tumor metabolism non-invasively and detect biological shifts using circulating
tumor cells (CTCs), to provide a comprehensive window into acquisition of cisplatin resistance as outlined in the
Projects listed below, supported by a robust administrative and analytical infrastructure organized into 3 Cores.
Project 1 will use state of the art metabolomic studies to identify the critical metabolic dependencies of
cisplatin resistant HNSCC, identify opportunities for effective metabolic inhibition and improve our understanding
of the cross-talk between the acquisition of cisplatin resistance and modulation of the tumor immune
microenvironment. Project 2 will explore the genomic and transcriptomic reprogramming required to sustain the
metabolic shifts which accompany development of resistance and interrogate how Nrf-2 dependent and
independent signaling drives resistance and enhanced distant metastasis through intrinsic cellular mechanisms
and paracrine signaling between tumor cells and adrenergic neurons. Project 3 will test whether the metabolic
reprogramming outlined in Project 1 is detectable via non-invasive imaging (hyperpolarized magnetic resonance
imaging) and whether the biological shifts outlined in Project 2 due to clonal extinction and expansion can be
detected using CTC analysis in patients undergoing cisplatin-based treatment.
 H-CARR has the potential to realize the full clinical utility of cisplatin by identifying acquisition of
resistance early during treatment and developing the means to overcome this and associated phenotypes such
as enhanced distant metastasis. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will generate the new
clinical standard for precision oncology approaches to clinical utilization of cisplatin in HNSCC and related upper-
aerodigestive tract cancers of the lung and esophagus and therefore have a major impact on cancer survival
worldwide."

Despite increasing knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of autism risk, the specific pathogenic mechanisms
underlying the emergence of motor and cognitive deficits in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remain unclear.
Recent imaging and genetic studies have pointed to corticostriatal dysfunction has a prevalent pathophysiology
in ASD. In particular, hypertrophy and abnormal functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) have been reported in multiple autistic individuals, providing a potential
neuropathological substrate for the repetitive behaviors and social deficits associated with autism. Our
laboratory has shown that mice with loss of function deletions in SHANK3 (Shank3B-/-), a highly penetrant
monogenic cause of autism, exhibit hyperactivity and abnormal patterns of connectivity in corticostriatal circuits
during postnatal development. Behavioral deficits in these animals also emerge during these early
developmental periods, suggesting that early corticostriatal dysfunction might be an important pathogenic
mechanism in SHANK3 associated disorders. Here we propose to further characterize how striatal circuit
development is impaired by loss of Shank3 and identify the specific corticostriatal pathways affected in these
conditions (Aim1). In addition, using recently developed conditional transgenic mice that allow cell-specific
manipulation of Shank3 expression we will dissect the specific mechanisms leading to corticostriatal
connectivity abnormalities (Aim 2). In addition, using new molecular strategies that normalize early excitatory
drive in striatal neurons, we will determine the pathogenic role of early striatal circuit dysfunction in the
emergence of maladaptive behaviors in Shank3B-/- mice (Aim 3). This work will advance our understanding of
the basic mechanisms and developmental rules regulating the maturation of corticostriatal circuits and provide
important insights into the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders with early activity
imbalances in corticostriatal circuits."

High out-of-pocket costs (OOPC) of cancer treatment and lost income result in financial hardship. There is
compelling evidence that OOPC communication complemented by financial navigation and counseling will
decrease financial hardship by enabling cancer patients to anticipate and accommodate treatment costs and
proactively seek financial assistance. Importantly, this intervention aligns with the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) price transparency mandate. We will evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative
personalized intervention designed to improve cost-related cancer care non-adherence by conducting a
randomized controlled trial of OOP cost communication and financial navigation (CostCOM) vs.
enhanced usual care (EUC) at NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practices. Our
multidisciplinary team has experience with all facets of the proposed intervention including conducting clinical
trials at NCORP practices. CostCOM comprises four 1-hour counseling sessions to impart: (1) OOPC
communication, individualized, patient-specific education of the anticipated OOPC using a price estimator tool;
(2) Financial navigation, real-time professional guidance to identify financial assistance programs that will
alleviate costs of care and discuss information to improve insurance coverage; and (3) Financial counseling to
address the range of patients’ financial concerns and enroll patients in financial assistance programs. We will
recruit 720 patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors (1:1 non-metastatic vs. metastatic) who plan to receive
anticancer therapy at one of the participating NCORP practices. CostCOM arm patients will participate in four
phone or video sessions with a remote financial counselor at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, with all three
components of CostCOM delivered at each session. At enrollment, EUC arm patients will receive usual care
enhanced by providing an educational brochure describing services and contact information of the Patient
Advocate Foundation (PAF), a national non-profit financial navigation organization. Patients will complete
surveys at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Our goals are to (1) compare the effectiveness of
CostCOM vs. EUC at 12 months on patient-reported cost-related cancer care nonadherence, defined as any
self-reported incident of delay, forgo, stop or change in cancer care due to cost concerns, as well as (2)
patient-reported material financial hardship, financial worry, and quality of life; and (3) conduct a process
evaluation to examine practice providers and CostCOM arm patients’ satisfaction with the intervention and
their perceptions of barriers and facilitators to CostCOM delivery (for providers) or receipt (for patients). A
successful CostCOM is a scalable and financially sustainable program that can be disseminated across
systems, conditions, and populations and improve cancer care delivery, patients’ experience, and health
outcomes."
10746410,"Chronic Glucocorticoids (GC) exposure has long been associated with metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance. GC convey their signals through an intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor that binds to genomic glucocorticoid response elements and recruits specific transcriptional coregulators to modulate the transcription of its target genes. Ehmt2 (a.k.a. G9a) is a GR coregulator that acts as a coactivator or corepressor. Our preliminary studies found that reducing Ehmt2 in liver exacerbated GC-induced insulin resistance. Intriguingly, this is caused by the coactivation but corepression function of Ehmt2, because mice carrying a mutation at the lysine 182 automethylation site of Ehmt2 (Ehmt2K182R/K182R mice) which abolishes the coactivation but not corepression function of Ehmt2, also had exacerbated GC-induced insulin resistance. RNA
sequencing experiment identified Dusp4 (a.k.a. MKP-2) as an Ehmt2 coactivation dependent GR-activated gene, which when overexpressed in liver, attenuated GC-induced insulin resistance. Thus, we hypothesize a novel GR-Ehmt2-Dusp4 axis that counteracts GR-induced insulin resistant genes to control the extent of insulin resistance. In Aim 1, we will examine the effect of losing the Ehmt2 coactivation on the ability of GC to modulate insulin signaling. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp will be used to examine Ehmt2’s role in regulating hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose utilization. We will also test whether increasing Ehmt2 coactivation capacity by elevating its automethylation reverses GC-induced insulin resistance. In Aim 2, we will reduce hepatic Dusp4 expression to further validate its role in GC-induced insulin resistance. We found that MAP kinase
ERK1/2 activity was increased in GC-treated Ehmt2K182R/K182R mouse liver. As Dusp4 is a MAP Kinase phosphatase, we will test whether Dusp4 is responsible for GC-induced ERK1/2 in Ehmt2K182R/K182R mouse liver and whether ERK1/2 is a target of Dusp4 in the regulation of GC-induced insulin resistance. Notably, Ehmt2 forms a heterodimer with Ehmt1 (a.k.a. GLP) and automethylation of Ehmt2 and Ehmt1 create a docking site for a transcriptional coactivator Cbx3 (a.k.a. HP1g). Our preliminary study found that reducing Ehmt1 expression had worsened GC-induced insulin resistance (similar to hepatic Ehmt2 knockdown and Ehmt2K182R/K182R mice). In Aim 3, we will examine whether automethylation of Ehmt1 results in similar phenotypes with  hmt2K182R/K182R
mice. We will also investigate whether hepatic Cbx3 knockdown exacerbates GC-induced insulin resistance. Finally, we will analyze the mechanism underlying Dusp4 gene transcription by GR and Ehmt2-Ehmt1-Cbx3 coactivator complex. The dogma for GC-induced insulin resistance is: GR activates genes promoting insulin resistance and represses genes promoting insulin sensitivity. In this proposal, we provide a revolutionary concept in which the extent of GC-induced insulin resistance is controlled by the balance of GR-activated genes that promoting insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance. Exploring the mechanism underlying this novel GR-Ehmt2-Dusp4 axis shall significantly impact on our understanding of the metabolic functions of GC."
10741806,"Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) experience severe and persistent difficulties with executive functions, such
as inhibitory control. Inhibitory control difficulties in BD could be related to inflammation via its effects on brain
functioning. However, direct measurement of brain inflammation markers (i.e. glial activation) in BD is limited
and further understanding of how glial activation contributes to inhibitory brain dysfunction in BD is needed. The
goal of this proposal is to study the neuroinflammatory basis of inhibitory control and identify novel neuroimmune
treatment targets for executive dysfunction in mood disorders. To this end, the candidate proposes: (1) training
objectives to establish expertise in the use of simultaneous PET-MRI as a research tool, an interdisciplinary
knowledge base in psychoneuroimmunology, and full independence with fMRI methodology, which together will
further career development into an expert clinical translational researcher in bipolar disorder; (2) a research
objective to examine glial activation as a mechanism of inhibitory control brain dysfunction and cognitive
performance in BD; (3) a team of mentors and advisors to ensure the candidate’s success, with expertise in
bipolar disorder (Dr. Andrew Nierenberg), multi-modal psychiatric neuroimaging (Dr. Darin Dougherty), molecular
imaging and simultaneous PET-fMRI (Dr. Jacob Hooker), psychiatric neuroimmunology (Dr. Beth Stevens), fMRI
inhibitory control paradigms (Dr. Scott Langenecker), and neuroimaging statistics (Dr. Mark Vangel). The
rationale for the proposed project is that despite evidence for inflammatory alterations in BD, interrogation of
brain inflammatory markers in-vivo and their role in executive functioning is limited. Human imaging with novel
radiopharmaceuticals to visualize glial activation and its role in inhibitory brain function is needed. The central
hypothesis of the proposal is that glial activation adversely impacts frontostriatal brain circuitry and, in turn,
inhibitory control in BD. The proposed specific aims are to determine the: (1) difference in glial activation
between BD (n = 20) and healthy controls (HC; n = 20); (2) association between glial activation and inhibitory
control neural circuitry in BD; (3) association between glial activation and inhibitory control performance on
cognitive testing in BD. This proposed research is innovative for examining markers of brain inflammation as a
novel mechanism of the understudied burden of executive function in BD using cutting edge simultaneous PET-
fMRI technology. The proposed research is significant because it could yield novel neuroimmune treatment
targets and crucial pilot data towards the use of PET-fMRI for understanding the unmet clinical problem of
inhibitory dysfunction in BD. Overall, this project and training plan will promote the candidate’s career
development by facilitating an independent program of program of research at the interface of psychiatric
neuroimaging and neuroimmunology. This is a critical first step in furthering the candidate’s career goals to
study the neuroinflammatory basis of cognition and to identify novel neuroimmune targets for future experimental
therapeutics in mood disorders."

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date.
Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are
recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is
small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within
the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast
MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have
omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was
made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with
the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning
“from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as
follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful
curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic
and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical
efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to
analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent
of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on
mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive
models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To
reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant
tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient
information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary
outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval
without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly
released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two
years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at
MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology
that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable
in particular to cancers with more limited datasets."
10747291,"Project Summary/Abstract Section
Neonatal brain injury is an important cause of death and disability, with pathways of oxidant stress,
inflammation, and excitotoxicity leading to damage that progress over a long period of time. Therapies have
classically targeted individual pathways during early phases of injury, but targeting pathways later in the
injury response may be additionally effective. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), while being standard of care
for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), provides protection only in 60% of babies. The overarching
hypothesis is that the metabolic state of the brain immediately after TH differs markedly between
hypothermia responders and non-responders. We will identify the metabolic state after TH using proton and
hyperpolarized carbon 13 spectroscopy and then study cellular pathways to identify more precise and
individualized treatment approaches. We will use postnatal day 9 mice and follow them through injury
evolution. The studies outlined in this proposal reflect an innovative and systematic approach to the study of
HI brain injury in the newborn because they combine advanced metabolic imaging techniques (proton and
carbon spectroscopy) and cell-signaling studies, focusing on HIF signaling, that will both inform and be
informed by human clinical studies. Utilizing genetic cellular approaches in which components of the injury
response are specifically deleted/disrupted in the specific cell compartments will allow us to evaluate the
benefits of the neurovascular niche in vivo. We will broadly interrogate HIF-dependent signaling pathways
following injury using ChIP-Seq. Together, these genetic tools will allow us to explore the molecular
regulation of HI both in vitro and in vivo to better identify more appropriate molecular targets for therapy for
the individual needing them the most. By investigating responses to HI at a cellular level using traditional
biochemical assays and global level in the brain using MR spectroscopy, we aim to make a link between
specific cellular changes and metabolic changes that can be detected non-invasively. This approach would
eventually allow the findings to be translated into the clinic and potentially change the management of
patients.
We will use in vitro techniques such as CRISPr/Cas9 and Chip-seq to dissect important signaling pathways
like hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). We will also use an invitro approach when we identify appropriate targets
and design therapies to counteract deficient repair. Thus, defining the cerebral metabolic signature of non-
responders will identify subsequent novel pathways to target, and will lead to improved outcomes that could
never be achieved by only targeting pathways through hypothermia alone. Understanding how the cascade
of injury responses occur and the key modulators during each phase will lead to more rationale therapies."
10748371,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The purpose of this project is to identify a novel pathway of neuroprotection in the chronic progressive
phases of the immune-mediated disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic progressive MS is largely
neurodegenerative as opposed to inflammatory; thus, it is not surprising that approved treatments, all of which
are immunomodulatory, have limited efficacy in treating progressive MS patients. Therefore, a paramount
necessity in MS research is to understand the mechanisms underlying progression in order to identify novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of progressive MS.
 Our previous studies revealed that immune cytokines act on regionally heterogenous astrocytes to yield
beneficial effects during protection and repair of the adult central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Since
astrocytes are abundant in MS lesions and have a critical regulatory role in CNS function and homeostasis during
inflammation, we hypothesized that astrocytes act as a pivotal regulator of immune-mediated processes during
chronic neuroinflammation. Towards this hypothesis, we identified a novel, interferon (IFN)γ-regulated pathway
active in chronic white-matter lesion astrocytes within progressive, postmortem MS patient tissue. We went on
to discover that IFNγ preferentially mediates upregulation of the immunoproteasome (iP) in primary astrocytes,
which leads to a reduction in damaging oxidative stress and protection from exacerbated chronic disease in an
in vivo murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Guided by strong preliminary
data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to elucidate how IFNγ mediates CNS protection via the astrocyte
iP during chronic neuroinflammation:
 1) Determine the expression kinetics of the IFNγ-iP axis in astrocytes during MS and EAE.
 2) Identify the mechanisms responsible for IFNγ-mediated survival and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
 clearance in astrocytes.
 3) Examine the role of astrocytic iP in modulating neurodegeneration.
 Collectively, our proposed research strategy will broadly impact the field by dissecting previously
unknown kinetics and mechanisms underlying an undescribed pathway that is active in astrocytes during
neuroinflammation and it will reveal a paradigm-shifting protective role for immune cytokines and the iP during
chronic MS. Long-term, these studies may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for progressive MS patients and
have the potential to be extrapolated to other neurodegenerative diseases with known iP dysfunction."

Challenges exist in bioremediation of halogenated contaminants, including low donor utilization efficiency and
slow dehalogenation, low dehalogenation activity and degree for the emerging per- and polyfluorinated
substances, as well as the difficulty in simultaneously treating co-contaminants. To address those challenges,
this project integrates advances in materials sciences and microbial reductive dehalogenation and proposes a
synergistic materials-microbe interface that can achieve faster, deeper, and air-tolerant reductive
dehalogenation. Charge transfer mechanisms in the proposed electricity-driven materials-microbe hybrid will be
investigated, which will guide the design and optimization of novel nano- and micro-scale materials to enhance
the mass-transport efficiency and accelerate dehalogenation. The local electron donor levels can be stably
maintained at low levels, favoring dehalorespiring microorganisms over methanogens and homoacetogens,
leading to enhanced electron donor utilization. A systems-level understanding of microorganisms enriched in the
bioelectrochemical system and genes/enzymes responsible for deeper defluorination will be obtained with omics
techniques. Novel reductive defluorination products/pathways and synergistic interactions between microbial
and electrochemical defluorination will be elucidated using advanced analytical tools such as high-resolution
mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an air-tolerant materials-microbe framework for reductive dehalogenation will
be developed using a recently designed microwire array electrodes and implemented to achieve concurrent
oxidation of the co-contaminant 1,4-dioxane in an open system. This project will significantly advance the
mechanistic understanding of the accelerated and deeper reductive dehalogenation at the synergistic materials-
microbe interface. This hybrid framework is powered by electricity that can be generated from sustainable solar
energy and may lower the cost by reducing the requirement of fermentable organics and by combining the
anaerobic and aerobic remediation processes. The successful demonstration of this new paradigm of
bioremediation will potentially lead to future applications for cleaning up the halogenated contaminants and co-
contaminants in subsurface environments. The developed materials-microbe framework is also highly
transformable to the bioremediation processes of other environmental contaminants."
11194032,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Read aligners first build an index from one or more reference genome(s) and subsequently use it to find and
extend matched subsequences between sequence reads and the reference(s). The bottleneck of using these
read aligners to index thousands of human reference genomes is the space and time needed for construct
and store the index. Hence, in the case of the human genome, it is common to restrict interest to alignment of
the standard reference genome, i.e., GChr38. Yet, the absence of diversity in this single reference genome
can cause substandard results in downstream analysis, impacting the ability to identify and study genetic
variation.
 To address the shortcomings associated with using a single reference genome, the concept of a pange-
nomics reference genome has been introduced and adopted. For example, Giraffe, VG, and Moni all aim
to index a population of genomes in a manner that enables read alignment. Although, these pangenomics
aligners have been shown to improve on the accuracy over standard read aligners (e.g., BWA and Bowtie)
there exists several challenges that prevent these methods from being used in practice for downstream anal-
ysis, such as variant calling. The goal of this proposal is to develop algorithms to address these challenges
and fully enable pangenomics alignment. In particular, we will create methods for selecting (from a large
population) a subset genomes that will achieve the most accurate alignment results, develop a pangenomics
scoring scheme that will enable the alignments from a pangenome to be attained, and disseminate our
methods in a user-friendly manner that enables automated updates."
10728876,"CD8 T cells mediate adaptive immune responses against malignant tumors and intracellular
pathogens. In order to exert their protective effector functions, they must engage in physical
contacts with their targets. Thus, T cells migrate actively within the body in search of cognate
antigens. Following encounter of viral antigens, anti-viral T cells make a series of fate decisions
that determine their differentiation into phenotypically diverse effector (Teff) and memory cell
(Tmem) subsets that possess specialized properties. The rules that govern the magnitude,
functional differentiation, migratory properties and life-span of virus-specific T cell subsets are
incompletely understood. Recent work has shown that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1
identifies three distinct CD8+ Teff and Tmem subsets that are induced by systemic viral infections.
The largest subset expresses high levels of CX3CR1 and is permanently devoid of lymph node
homing receptors. Consequently, CX3CR1hi Teff and Tmem (referred to as effector memory cells,
or Tem) are abundant in blood and spleen, but absent from other lymphoid tissues. Contrary to
the prevailing paradigm, preliminary experiments indicate that CX3CR1hi Teff and Tem are also
excluded from the extravascular compartment in non-lymphoid tissues. Instead, multi-photon
intravital microscopy observations indicate that large numbers of CX3CR1hi T cells marginate
and arrest within venules and then crawl against the blood stream across the capillary bed into
arterioles where the CX3CR1hi T cells are found at high density. The present project will explore
the hypothesis that crawling Teff and Tem employ unique molecular mechanisms to adhere and
migrate within the microvasculature to survey microvascular endothelial cells for antigens and to
receive signals that shape the Tmem repertoire. This hypothesis will be addressed in two specific
aims: (1.) to characterize the migratory properties of intravascular anti-viral Teff and Tmem; and
(2.) to assess the impact of intravascular T cell crawling on Teff and Tmem differentiation and
function."

Worldwide, colorectal cancer is responsible for approximately 0.4 million deaths annually, which represent
approximately 10% of all cancer deaths. The main cause of death in colorectal cancer patients is hepatic
metastasis. Although regional treatment options, including hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) and
percutaneous IHP, offer the benefits of both aggressive local treatment and limited systemic toxicity, the
management of unresectable hepatic colorectal metastases remains a major unsolved issue and more
effective novel regimens are needed. During the grant period, we propose developing a novel treatment
strategy for hepatic colorectal metastases. Considering our previous studies, the combined treatment of
hyperthermia, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and ferroptotic agent
synergistically induces cytotoxicity and effectively enhances the tumoricidal efficacy of subcutaneous
xenografts. In this grant application, we hypothesize that a combinatorial treatment of mild
hyperthermia, the biologic agent TRAIL, and the ferroptotic agent artesunate (ART) is effective in
treating unresectable hepatic colorectal metastases (HCM). The specific aims of this project are to (1)
elucidate the mechanism of synergistic anti-tumor efficacy caused by hyperthermia in combination with TRAIL
and ART treatment (HTA: hyperthermia + TRAIL + ART) in tumoroid models, and (2) investigate the preclinical
efficacy of this HTA treatment in humanized rat isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) models. The proposed studies
for the first aim will establish tumoroid models with tumor tissues from patients with HCM and employ
biochemical and molecular techniques to investigate the cell death mechanism induced by synergistic effects
of the HTA treatment. For the second aim, we will develop humanized rat IHP models with tumor tissues from
patients with HCM and then evaluate the therapeutic advantage of the HTA treatment. We believe that the
successful outcome of this study will support the application of this multimodal approach to HCM."

Radiation therapy is utilized to treat approximately half of all cancer patients. For some patients,
radiation therapy can achieve local tumor control and cure. For other patients, radiation therapy
palliates symptoms and alleviates suffering. However, radiation therapy can also cause acute toxicity
and late effects that diminish quality of life. The goal of our research program is to widen the
therapeutic window of radiation therapy by dissecting mechanisms of normal tissue radiation injury and
tumor response to radiotherapy. As I am a sarcoma radiation oncologist, my research group not only
studies sarcoma response to radiation therapy, but also sarcoma development and metastasis. During
the prior funding period, we adapted CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop novel genetically engineered
mouse models of sarcoma that facilitated lineage tracing of sarcoma clones during tumor progression.
This approach identified novel regulators of metastasis, which are potential targets for new cancer
therapies. We also used new mouse and in vitro models to discover a novel mechanism for the
exquisite radiosensitivity of myxoid liposarcoma: DNA-damage induced phosphorylation of a prion-like
domain in the FUS-CHOP fusion protein disrupts interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes
that are required for tumor maintenance. We initiated new projects with a novel sarcoma model with
high tumor mutation burden that revealed tumor-intrinsic and immune-mediated mechanisms of
response and resistance to radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Our findings provided the rationale for a
randomized clinical trial in sarcoma patients testing radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition.
We also used our genetically engineered mice to uncover mechanisms regulating acute toxicity and
late effects of radiation, such as radiation carcinogenesis. Our proposed research will build on the
success of our recent work. We will use innovative model systems and sophisticated approaches to
make discoveries in three broad areas:
1. Response of sarcomas to radiotherapy
2. Response and resistance of sarcomas to radiation and immunotherapy
3. Normal tissue injury from radiation
The knowledge gained from the proposed studies will not only deepen our understanding of radiation
and sarcoma biology, but will also inform the design of future clinical trials that aim to widen the
therapeutic ratio of radiation therapy to improve the outcome for patients with sarcomas and other
cancers."

Immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment. The outcome of therapy directly
results from changes imposed on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by checkpoint blockade. However, only a
subset of patients respond. What controls this disparity is poorly understood. We propose to develop and apply
tools that can help differentiate responders from non-responders in different pre-clinical tumor models soon after
the start of treatment. We have shown that immuno-positron emission tomography (Immuno-PET) can be used
to monitor infiltration status of specific subsets of immune cells, namely T cells and myeloid cells. We use small
(~15 kDa) camelid-derived single domain antibodies (nanobodies) that have nM to pM affinity for their targets to
perform immuno-PET imaging. Our unique chemical approaches provide imaging agents of unprecedented
quality and sensitivity. Even cells that display proteins of relatively low abundance such as CTLA-4 can be clealrly
imaged. We have shown in several (syngeneic) tumor models that monitoring the dynamics of cytotoxic T cells
in the TME can be used to distinguish early responders from non-responders. This observation has allowed us
to stratify animals into responders and non-responders, then excise their tumors, isolate the immune infiltrating
cells, and subject these to single-cell RNA sequencing. These data show that the myeloid compartment and the
cytokines and chemokines it produces, plays a major role in determining the outcome of anti PD-1 treatment.
We propose to expand these initial findings to additional mouse tumor models, given the distinct cells of origin
that give rise to them and their differences in susceptibility to immune intervention. This project is aimed at
bringing to light key changes that take place in the TME early on, using immuno-PET. Our complementary
molecular analyses will help design more effective therapies. Macrophages and DCs in the TME of responders
produce CXCL9, a chemoattractant for cytotoxic T cells that helps maintain their activated state. This chemokine
is therefore a key player in the outcome of anti-PD-1 therapy. We thus propose to re-engineer the TME by using
chemistry to make novel CXCL9-fusion proteins and deliver them to the TME. Single-domain antibodies are
perfect candidates for such fusions. Their small size allows excellent tissue penetration and their high affinity
ensures efficient delivery to, and retention in, the TME. Imaging the distribution of CXCL9 or its receptor will shed
further light on the anti-tumor immune status. We will therefore generate nanobodies as imaging agents specific
for such cytokines and their receptors."
11009477,"Peripheral Nerve Injury (PNI) occurs in 3% of all trauma cases and 30% of combat injuries to
the extremities, resulting in a loss of five million working days each year and costs of $150
billion annually in the U.S. The standard of care in the clinic is a nerve autograft from the
patients’ leg. The NeuroSpan Bridge is a unique, biomimetic, multi-channel scaffold that
maintains linearity throughout the structure, thus accelerating and guiding regenerating axons
precisely to their targets on the distal end of the transected nerve. It has been extensively tested
in gaps up to 3cm-long and demonstrated superiority to existing devices in a short-gap animal
model, and superiority to nerve autograft in a long-gap animal model. This project will put in
place a program to finalize pre-clinical studies, submit an IDE application to the FDA and carry
out a feasibility clinical study followed by 510(k) application. The proposed project brings
together experts in peripheral nerve injury, axonal regeneration, neurology, neurosurgery and
bioengineering to develop a practical, cost-effective, consistent, and transnationally relevant
medical device for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury."
10744734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adaptation of living organisms to constantly changing environments depends on the plasticity of the
nervous system. Neuronal plasticity often requires activity-dependent translation to rapidly supply selected
proteins, for example, through activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs). Gp1
mGluRs, including mGluR1 and mGluR5, mediate translation-dependent synaptic plasticity, including long-term
synaptic depression (LTD). Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling is observed with various neurological and mental
disorders, including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although
pharmacological correction of Gp1 mGluR activity reverses many of the phenotypes in animal models of those
diseases, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Gp1 mGluR-mediated synaptic plasticity have been
elusive. Our published and preliminary data introduce the ubiquitin E3 ligase Murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) as
a novel translational repressor and a “switch” that permits Gp1 mGluR-induced protein translation (Liu et al.,
Hum Mol Genet., 2017). In our proposed research, we aim to characterize the role of Mdm2 in Gp1 mGluR-
dependent synaptic plasticity (Aim 1) and determine the mechanism by which Mdm2 mediates activity-dependent
protein translation (Aim 2). Our new data also show that Mdm2 is molecularly altered and unresponsive to Gp1
mGluR activation in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, the commonly used animal model for studying FXS (Tsai
et al., Hum Mol Genet., 2017). In Aim 3 we will characterize the mechanism by which Fmr1 interconnects Gp1
mGluR signaling to permit translational activation through de-repressing Mdm2. Successful completion of this
proposal will greatly facilitate the understanding of Gp1 mGluR-mediated synaptic plasticity through a novel
mechanism of translational control. Building on the deep knowledge of Mdm2 in cancer biology, our research
will also open a new avenue for the study of neurological disorders associated with abnormal Gp1 mGluR
signaling."
10766357,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The thalamus is associated with critical neurological functions like regulation of consciousness, sleep, arousal,
and alertness in addition to relaying signals to the cortex. It is divided into multiple functionally specialized units
called thalamic nuclei which have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases such
as essential tremor, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia.
Automated segmentation of thalamic nuclei from MRI data is not commonplace, due to their poor visibility in
conventional MRI. Segmentation methods based on functional MRI (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
have been limited by the spatial resolution of the echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition and poor diffusion
anisotropy in the grey-matter dominated thalamus. As a result, most neuroimaging studies treat the thalamus
as a single entity, characterizing whole volume changes and using the whole thalamus as a seed for
connectivity analyses, significantly reducing sensitivity to nuclei-specific changes in pathology. We have
developed automated multi-atlas as well as deep-learning based thalamic nuclei segmentation techniques
based on a novel white-matter-nulled contrast scheme. The purpose of this grant is to develop the next-
generation methods for thalamic visualization and segmentation using multi-contrast imaging and cutting-edge
image processing techniques and testing it on data from healthy controls, and patients with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This will be achieved using the following aims:
a) Development of a novel fast motion-robust multi-contrast imaging sequence which will provide co-registered
susceptibility weighted and MPRAGE images with different contrasts (e.g., white-matter and CSF-nulled)
b) Acquisition and creation of age-stratified atlases from subjects in the 18-80 age range
c) Development of a multi-contrast deep-learning based automatic segmentation scheme
d) Development of a contrast-synthesis strategy to segment conventional MPRAGE
e) Documenting changes in volumes, and structural/functional connectivity in healthy aging and across the AD
continuum using data from the OASIS database using the proposed segmentation methods.
The segmentation methods developed here can be used characterize thalamic atrophy in normal aging and in
disease populations with high sensitivity. The project is expected to yield new MR imaging biomarkers which
could be used in future studies for the identification and evaluation of novel therapeutic targets."

Host-adapted strains of Salmonella enterica cause systemic infections and have the ability to persist systemically
within granulomas for long periods of time. Persistently infected hosts are often asymptomatic and transmit
disease to naïve hosts, thereby serving as a critical reservoir for disease. From the bacterial perspective,
persistent infection is essential for microbial survival in nature. However, very little is known about the molecular
mechanisms involved in persistent Salmonella infections and transmission between mammalian hosts.
Increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Salmonella persistence may lead to the ability to eradicate
the Salmonella carrier state pharmacologically. Our long-term goal is to understand how Salmonella
persists within tissues of mammalian hosts for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective of this
proposal, which is our next step in pursuit of this goal, is to identify host pathways involved in granuloma
dynamics and to determine how Salmonella manipulates host cells for long-term survival. The premise that will
be tested in this application is that Salmonella injects virulence factors into granuloma macrophages that both
promote an anti-inflammatory state and block specific proinflammatory responses in order to persist in
mammalian hosts. We propose to study the molecular mechanisms of persistent Salmonella infections in
granulomas of mammalian hosts. Aim 1 will characterize the cellular organization and molecular regulation of
granulomas during persistent Salmonella mouse infection, with a particular focus on visualization and analysis
of gene expression of granuloma macrophages in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics. In Aim 2, we will
identify mechanisms of Salmonella-dependent manipulation of granuloma macrophages. Aim 3 will characterize
the role of the Type 6 secretion system during persistent Salmonella infection. The proposed research is
innovative because we investigate the spatial transcriptomics of granuloma macrophages, a heretofore-
unexamined pathogen niche. Insight into host-pathogen interactions during persistent infection of a mammalian
host is impactful as novel biomarkers and treatments of asymptomatic carriers are needed for eradication of this
disease reservoir."
10516739,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain a significant risk to human health, and a primary target of concern is
the developing brain. Research on PCB developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) has focused almost exclusively on
the higher chlorinated (HC)-PCBs; in contrast, our understanding of the potential for LC-PCBs to interfere with
neurodevelopment is extremely limited. This is a troubling data gap in light of our discovery during the previous
project period that the LC-PCBs 11 and 28 comprise >70% of the PCBs in the serum of pregnant women at
increased risk for having a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). We found that PCB 11 and its
metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation promote dendritic and axonal growth in
vitro. These effects are observed at PCB 11 concentrations relevant to the human gestational environment,
and the potency of the metabolites varied from that of the parent. Our preliminary data suggest that PCB 11
causes DNT via activation of CREB-dependent signaling pathways. Whether the metabolites alter
neurodevelopment via the same molecular mechanism is not known. These findings, which were the first to
identify the DNT potential of LC-PCBs, raise several critical questions that must be addressed to define the risk
that LC-PCBs pose to the developing human brain: (1) Do LC-PCBs found in the gestational environment alter
neurodevelopment in the intact brain? (2) What are the molecular mechanism(s) by which LC-PCBs alter
neuronal morphogenesis? (3) Does human CYP-mediated metabolism activate LC-PCBs to developmental
neurotoxicants? To address these questions, we will test the central hypothesis that CYP-mediated
metabolism influences the in vivo effects of LC-PCBs on CREB-dependent neurodevelopmental processes. To
test this novel hypothesis, we will leverage state-of-the-art mouse models engineered to express human
CYP2A6 or CYP2B6 but not mouse Cyp2a, 2b, 2f2, 2g1, and 2s1 proteins (Cyp2abfgs-null mice). Focusing on
LC-PCBs documented in the human gestational environment and developing brain, we will (a) identify the LC-
PCB metabolites formed via human CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, and test their effects on CREB-dependent
neurodevelopmental processes in primary neuron-glia co-cultures; and (b) determine how modulation of LC-
PCB metabolism influences the dose-response relationship of LC-PCB DNT in vivo. The anticipated outcomes
of these studies include the identification of LC-PCBs as a new class of environmental contaminants that
interfere with neurodevelopment and novel mechanistic data regarding the role of CREB signaling and CYP-
mediated bioactivation in PCB DNT. This research will impact public health not only by generating data
critically needed to assess the risk LC-PCBs pose to the developing brain, but also by providing critical
mechanistic insights regarding the plausibility of dietary and/or pharmacological manipulation of CYP activity to
mitigate DNT risk in vulnerable subpopulations."

 In this study we seek to understand how rare genetic variation in all protein coding genes (the exome)
influences the risk of developing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is of major public health
importance owing to its profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about its etiology, and
treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, ADHD), whole exome
sequencing (WES) in large numbers of subjects has begun to deliver fundamental knowledge about genetic
architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize pathways altered in disease. We intend to
realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing the worldwide number of OCD subjects with
WES data, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental biology of this condition.
 Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will produce WES data from 5,100
OCD subjects and 3,000 ancestry-matched controls, all from Sweden and Norway. Sequencing individuals
from these countries provides the substantial advantage of knowing about co-morbid conditions. We will call
rare genetic variation from the sequencing data. Second, we will combine these new data with existing WES
data for ~1,400 OCD cases and ~8,000 controls. This will increase power to identify OCD risk genes, which we
will do using a combination of existing and novel analytical methods. Third, we will further refine our
understanding of the genetic architecture of OCD, focusing on the relationship of OCD risk to risk for other
neurodevelopmental disorders, including tic disorders, autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Combining WES data from multiple large studies will enhance power to identify shared loci and begin to
identify loci with greater specificity for OCD. Overall, we believe this study will improve our understanding of
genetic risk factors for OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and
societal costs."
10735869,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The goal of this proposal is to identify early life predictors of symptoms of ADHD and associated behavioral and
emotional problems. To do so children are followed from before birth to 4.5 years of age—on the cusp of school entry and
well into the preschool period. ADHD and related problems with behavioral and emotional dysregulation are often not
clinically identified until school age. By that point they are difficult to reverse. This proposal answers calls in the literature
for earlier identification of risk and for discovery of early life mechanisms that can be targets for low-risk yet effective
early life intervention to prevent the full onset of these problems. To do so we expand the study of an existing maternal-
infant cohort by adding measures, time points, and an older outcome. We extend the cohort from the toddler years into the
preschool period when psychopathology has begun to take shape and be able to be relatively reliably characterized. Key
mechanisms to be examined are (a) biological signals in early life, focused on maternal inflammation and serotonergic
metabolites during pregnancy and the trajectory of change in those signals in the first three years of life; (b) brain
development as indexed by EEG measures from birth to age 3 years (lower cost and more readily clinically applicable
than MRI at this stage); and (c) behavioral dynamics in early caregiving, about which little is known regarding ADHD
risk in the first 24 months of life. The inflammation hypothesis builds on striking preliminary data uncovered by the PI's
in their prior work. The EEG metrics likewise are supported by preliminary evidence. The behavioral data also have
strong preliminary data and build on multiple theorists' proposals about the role of early emotional regulation in
subsequent risk for dysregulatory psychopathology and ADHD. Both baseline (intercept) and change (trajectory)
measures will be examined to help evaluate when in development a particular domain or level of analysis is most
informative to subsequent outcome. Each of these hypotheses is examined in stand-alone fashion, and then with those
findings in hand, an integrative developmental model will be tested. If successful the study will open new directions for
low-risk yet potentially effective early intervention by identifying specific, measurable, and reversible risk factors or
mechanisms as candidates for clinical trial follow up."

As  a  functionally  important  aspect  of  cognitive  flexibility,  reversal  learning  leads  to

10747292,"Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who
are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive
deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are
among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation.
Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and
proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort
study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during
which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER
has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these
disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact,
and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS
disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an
agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric,
substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial
(BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new
therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.
 Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to
a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To
accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from
CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim
1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed
genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array)
and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will
include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates
more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to
those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary
data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the
need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease."
10744730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults, with rates of suicide deaths
rising in the past two decades. Research examining risk for suicide has focused largely on long-term risk
factors, with limited empirical investigations of short-term predictors of suicide in adolescents during periods of
highest risk. To develop effective interventions to prevent suicidal behaviors during these elevated risk periods,
it is crucial to understand the regulatory mechanisms that may intensify risk or enhance resilience. Risk for
suicide is a dynamic, state-sensitive process, often characterized as a relatively brief period of dysregulation.
Thus, the ability to flexibly regulate emotional and biological responses to stressors is a critical process to
examine in adolescents vulnerable to suicide. The proposed study seeks to address an important gap in
current research by examining stress responses and emotion regulation flexibility at multiple levels of analysis
to determine whether these processes are predictive of short-term suicide risk during the transition out of
intensive hospital services. The study will include a sample of adolescents (N=90) with a past 30-day history of
suicidal ideation and/or events that are currently receiving treatment in the Bradley Hospital adolescent partial
hospital program. Participants will complete an initial assessment followed by a 2-week EMA protocol and a 3-
month follow up assessment. The goals for the proposed project include: (1) characterizing emotion regulation
flexibility in the context of interpersonal stress utilizing self-report, laboratory, and ecologically valid
assessments; (2) examine associated physiological responses to affective cues and stressors; and (3)
prospectively examine the relationship between regulatory responses and suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. The proposed training plan closely aligns with the research goals of this project, and includes: (1)
cultivating expertise in translational clinical research in adolescents at high-risk for suicidality; (2) immersive
training in EMA data acquisition and intensive longitudinal data analysis; (3) gaining skills in utilizing
psychophysiological methodology; and (4) professional development, including dissemination of research,
fostering research collaborations, and further training in grant writing. The mentorship team has expertise in
translational research in adolescent suicidality (Drs. Richard Liu and Brandon Gaudiano), EMA data collection
during transition periods (Dr. Brandon Gaudiano), multi-level modeling for intensive longitudinal data (Drs.
Leslie Brick and Richard Jones), and psychophysiological methods (Dr. Stephen Sheinkopf). This application
has important clinical implications, as findings from this study may identify critical variables to monitor and
target during high-risk periods. Thus, the proposed study has the potential to inform future research studies
testing regulatory flexibility as a target mechanism for interventions for adolescents vulnerable to suicide."

10908308,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Background. Sepsis, a severe and life-threatening condition, is one of the most common causes of death in
hospitalized patients. Sepsis is generally caused by bacterial infection, including both Gram-negative and
positive bacteria. In the United States, the hospital mortality rate of patients with sepsis could be as high as
41.1%, which accounts for more than 250,000 deaths and $20 billion loss annually. Due to the inadequate
sensitivity and specificity of the current technologies, there is no global standard for sepsis diagnosis. In this
project, the PI has the ambition to address the critical bottlenecks specifically of concern in sepsis testing using:
1) hybrid bio-inorganic nanobots, 2) CRISPR-based devices, and 3) CRISPR-equipped engineered phages.
Goals for the next five years. Our first goal is to engineer phage M13 with nanobodies on the capsid protein
pVIII and his-tags on the tail fiber protein pIII. After binding cobalt-coated magnetic nanoparticles, the resulting
hybrid bio-inorganic nanobots will be used to concentrate and purify pathogens from blood samples. Capture
efficiency will be investigated using spiked samples and then proceed to clinical ones. Taking advantage of
CRISPR and microfluidic technologies, the second goal is to fabricate portable devices to detect sepsis-related
pathogens, which can be used in resource-limited settings. The last goal is to engineer phages with different
CRISPR systems, that can be used to detect and combat sepsis-related bacterial pathogens. Towards the end
of the fifth year, we will have integrated these technologies as a robust tool for sepsis diagnosis.
Overall vision of the research program. The technologies we are developing will have a broad impact on the
biomedical research communities to detect and treat sepsis, even for other diseases. Our developed
technologies can also advance pathogen detection in other fields, such as food safety and environmental
monitoring."
10734760,"Project Summary
Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic methodologies have enabled
great progress in better understanding RNA processing, regulation and modification. RNA
editing is a prevalent type of RNA modification where the RNA sequences are altered through
insertion, deletion or substitution of nucleotides. In mammals, the most common type of RNA
editing is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing. A-to-I editing is essential for normal life and
development. A handful of A-to-I editing sites have been discovered with critical roles in
neuronal signaling, by modulating membrane excitability, neurotransmission plasticity and signal
transduction. In addition, aberrant RNA editing has been implicated in human neuropsychiatric
diseases, such as Autism, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, schizophrenia, and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. While numerous RNA editing sites have been identified via RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) and related technologies, major challenges exist in understanding the function and
regulation of RNA editing. The vast majority of known human RNA editing sites reside in non-
coding regions, such as introns and untranslated regions, that may confer regulatory function to
the related gene, especially at the level of post-transcriptional regulation. Therefore, there is a
great demand for in-depth studies of the functional impacts of RNA editing on post-
transcriptional regulation. The regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing are poorly characterized.
Except the ADAR enzymes, few proteins and their mechanisms of action have been examined
for RNA editing. A major challenge is the lack of efficient and systematic methods to pinpoint
novel regulators. In this project, we propose to extend our recent success at developing
bioinformatic and experimental frameworks to address the above challenges. We will capitalize
on the large collection of RNA-seq data sets derived from postmortem brain samples. We will
develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets, complemented by
further bioinformatic prediction and high-throughput experimental testing, to predict and validate
the molecular function of RNA editing and related regulatory mechanisms. This work will allow a
previously unattained level of understanding of the molecular basis of RNA editing and provide
new insights to the involvement of RNA editing in human biology."
10760240,"Project Summary: More than 16,000 US children need the implantation of a valved conduit to replace the right
ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) annually. These children require one to four repeat open-heart surgeries to
replace the valved conduit before they reach adulthood because available prostheses do not grow with the child.
The long-term goal of our multidisciplinary collaborative team is to develop a biostable polymeric valved conduit
that can be implanted surgically to reconstruct the RVOT and then expanded (by successive transcatheter
procedures) to avoid multiple surgeries in children. Our overall objective is to design, validate and demonstrate
the in vitro and in vivo proof of concept of the expandability and valvar competence of the device. Our central
hypothesis is that the use and controlled processing of a biostable polymer with adequate plasticity, associated
to an optimized design of the valve, can allow for successive controlled expansions while maintaining valve
competence. We will test this hypothesis in the following three specific aims: Aim1: Characterize the growth
accommodation of non-valved conduits. We will 1.1) characterize the mechanical properties of 8 ePTFE
materials with varying densities and thicknesses using a uniaxial tensile tester, 1.2) develop a computational
model of tube expansion from 12-24 mm based on the mechanical data, and 1.3) validate the expansion
experimentally using a transcatheter balloon and measuring the expansion potential, uniaxial tensile properties
and microarchitecture. Aim 2: Develop a valve design for competence at all diameters. Our hypothesis is that a
valve design with increased height of coaptation and increased length of the free edge can be expanded from a
12-24 mm diameter while maintaining valve competence. We will use a fluid-structure interaction based
computational design, prototype fabrication, and experimental validation in our heart valve pulse duplicator to
iteratively examine the effects of the design on the hemodynamic performance of the valved conduit. Aim 3:
Describe the performance and durability of the valved conduit. We will 3.1) characterize the biocompatibility
using an aortic rat model; 3.2) demonstrate the acute in vivo performance in a sheep model; 3.3) assess the in
vitro durability in an accelerated wear tester. Expected outcomes: to have identified the conditions of the
fabrication process, optimized the valve hydrodynamics for different stages of expansion and performed the in
vitro and in vivo proof of concept of the biocompatibility, expandability and maintenance of the valvar competence
of the device. The innovation of the proposed research is that we will develop a valved conduit designed
specifically for growth-accommodation that is durable and competent at every stage of expansion, using and
developing innovative designs, computational models, manufacturing techniques and translational
methodologies. Impact and significance: our results will contribute to the evidence for further development of an
innovative expandable surgical valved device that will help avoid multiple repeat open-heart surgeries in children.
Future studies include cytotoxicity testing and a pre-clinical study to prepare FDA approval."
11192524,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
The impressive clinical successes in immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy over the last decade have not
been matched by the development of clinically useful tools to predict patient response and toxicity. The
integration of biomarkers of patient outcome and toxicity into clinical care would allow more optimal treatment
selection. The primary objective of the New York University (NYU) Melanoma SPORE is to address the urgent
need to develop and validate clinically useful, personalized biomarkers to optimally administer immune
checkpoint inhibition therapies in the adjuvant setting. We have chosen to concentrate our efforts in this area
because FDA approval of immunotherapies in this clinical context has led to a significant increase in the
utilization of these treatments with expansion of adjuvant trials to other cancers. The use of adjuvant ICI will alter
the immunobiology of melanoma and other malignancies as well. Identifying biomarkers of benefit and toxicity is
critical, timely, and promises to have broad applicability. We have made significant progress towards these aims.
In the first five years of funding, we published 155 papers (82 SPORE-related, 15 are inter-SPORE collaborative
publications); generated an additional 4 team science awards; developed a pre-treatment auto-antibodies
signature that can predict toxicity and recurrence; and supported 20 DRP and CEP awardees. The extension of
support for the NYU Melanoma SPORE for a sixth year with interim funding will facilitate the continuation of
these efforts and maintenance of our translational infrastructure to sustain progress towards our competitive
renewal. We therefore request interim funding for Projects 2 and 3 as well as support for the Administrative Core
A and the Biospecimen Core B. While continued funding for Cores A and B are necessary to maintain the
functional infrastructure that is a core strength of our program, Project 2 and 3 were selected both for the impact
of their ongoing work and their direct relevance to the competitive renewal. Project 1 of the competitive renewal
is the continuation of our current Project 3, which is focused on understanding the predictive power of serum
autoantibodies to determine response and toxicity and the underlying biology of toxicity. Project 2, which has
extracted novel genomic biomarkers of response in the setting of adjuvant therapy, directly supports both
Projects 1 and 3, where multi-omic approaches will be used to dissect tissue-based and peripheral immune
determinants of both response and toxicity. With this support we will therefore continue to advance our efforts to
solve pressing needs in the melanoma field, with the expectation that our insights can be extended to the
increasing number of ICI--treated cancers."
10791734,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Although Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is an urgent public health priority, the diagnosis and
management of NAS remains challenging. This is primarily due to the multifactorial nature of NAS and the
highly subjective measures to assess this condition. Males and females with NAS have distinct risk profiles, yet
within the current paradigm they are managed uniformly. The limited understanding of long-term outcomes
further compounds the problem and predisposes this population to a myriad of health issues. To address these
knowledge gaps, the current proposal expands upon the molecular and behavioral data from our K12-funded
pilot study to better understand the impact of prenatal opioid exposure. An early sign of withdrawal in opioid-
exposed neonates is difficulty feeding followed by hyperphagia, which often precedes severe NAS and the
need for pharmacotherapy. Using saliva collected immediately after birth, we showed higher expression of a
key reward gene (DRD2) in opioid-exposed males compared to females. The expression of DRD2 also
correlated with the caloric intake in opioid-exposed males who later developed severe NAS and required
pharmacotherapy. These transcriptomic-behavioral data indicate that prenatal opioid exposure dysregulates
brain reward signaling in a sex-specific manner, resulting in hyperphagia as a reward-seeking behavior that
offsets the acute loss of opioids. Furthermore, opioid-exposed neonates have heightened expression of
inflammatory genes (IL6, MCP1) that correlate with the expression of DRD2, particularly in females. Expanding
on these preliminary results, the current proposal will examine if prenatal opioids dysregulate brain reward
signaling and modulate pro-inflammatory pathways with increased sex-specific risks for hyperphagia and
associated long-term cardiometabolic disorders. Our overarching goal is to understand changes in sex-specific
reward and inflammatory gene expression in opioid-exposed neonates throughout the first year of life. The
hypothesis will be tested in two aims: 1) Identify sex-specific effects of prenatal opioids on reward signaling
and inflammation, 2) Evaluate effects of prenatal opioids on risk for subsequent cardiometabolic disorders. We
will collect serial saliva samples from 56 opioid-exposed and 56 sex- and age-matched non-exposed neonates
during the initial hospitalization and then in a subset of infants post hospital discharge up to 1 year of age to
evaluate the expression of reward and inflammation genes. Early cardiometabolic risk will be assessed using
serum lipid panels at 1 year of age, along with growth and nutritional data. Results will be analyzed by sex. The
impact of this proposed project lies in the potential to advance the field with a more comprehensive
understanding of the sex-specific impact of prenatal opioid exposure on the developing brain through non-
invasive molecular analyses, enabling personalized medicine and longitudinal health monitoring."
10781898,"Project Summary. The 5-year K01 Mentored Research Scientist proposal will employ brain, neurocognitive,
and computational tools (e.g., deep learning) to understand the impact of opioid-use disorder (OUD) and
common co-occurring issues on executive function and clinical outcomes. There have been record numbers of
fatal and non-fatal overdoses (ODs) associated with opioids (and other drugs) in the past 12-months. Improving
classification and predictive capabilities to enhance treatment and prevent relapse is of the upmost importance.
Deficits in neurocognition often are associated with poor treatment outcomes (e.g., more drug use, medication
non-adherence), yet co-occurring issues associated with OUD (e.g., depression, anxiety, physical/sexual abuse,
neglect) make it difficult to parse which contributing factors lead to worse executive function (EF) and poorer
treatment outcomes. Novel brain, neurocognitive, and computational tools are needed to help determine these
differences, in order to lay the foundation for better treatments. This need has shaped both the training plan and
the associated research project in a 5-year K01 Mentored Research Scientist proposal, building on Dr. Regier's
prior preclinical and clinical addiction neuroscience experience (focused mostly on cocaine-use disorders, cue-
reactivity, subcortical networks, prior adversity, and univariate imaging (fMRI) techniques). Mentor Dr. Childress
will guide career development, and will coordinate training and individualized mentoring from a group of top-tier
experts centered around 4 areas: Training Aim 1) opioid use disorder (OUD), its treatments, and comorbidities
(Dr. Kampman, mentor), Training Aim 2) neurocognition (Dr. Gur, mentor), the impact of mental health, and its
relationship to clinical outcomes, Training Aim 3) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a mobile, non-
invasive cortical brain imaging technology (Dr. Ayaz, Mentor), and Training Aim 4) advanced computational
techniques (deep learning; Drs. Ayaz and Curtin) in outcome prediction. The training aims will be enabled by the
Research Project Aims. Research Aim 1 (Conventional Approach): Examine differences between OUD vs HC
on EF scores and PFC activity during EF tasks (Aim 1a); Using step-wise regression, examine relationship of
brain (PFC) data and/or co-occurring variables with EF (Aim 1b) and clinical outcomes (Aim 1c). Research Aim
2 (Deep Learning): Examine whether multi-task, spatiotemporal brain data can distinguish OUD from HCs (Aim
2a). Within the OUD population, examine whether multi-task, spatiotemporal brain data can classify better or
worse EF (Aim 2b) and/or drug-use outcome groups (Aim 2c). Exploratory: Add co-occurring variables into the
deep learning pipeline to determine whether they improve classification of either EF and/or drug-use outcomes.
The proposed K01 will facilitate Dr. Regier's transition to an independent research career focused on brain-
behavioral vulnerabilities in relapse and recovery. It will also provide much-needed knowledge about
neurocognition and its neural correlates and co-occurring contributors to relapse risk in those struggling toward
recovery."
10874415,"UAB NORC PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We request funding to continue and expand on the outstanding success achieved by UAB's Nutrition Obesity
Research Center (NORC) in its first four funding cycles and particularly during the past 4+ years. Inaugurated
with NIH funding in 2000, our NORC fosters multidisciplinary, collaborative, basic, clinical, and translational
research in nutrition and obesity. The NORC's research base grew gradually in number and productivity
through the first three funding cycles but has achieved explosive growth in funding during the last funding
period. The UAB NORC supports a research base of 95 regular members (up from 63 members) and 11 junior
members. Growth came from 1) success of junior researchers; 2) attraction of other UAB researchers into the
research base; and 3) recruitment of new researchers. Our research base generates over $41,000,000 (up
from $21,000,000) in direct funding for nutrition/obesity research and published 438 peer-reviewed papers over
the past funding period. Important contributions were made in 1) obesity and metabolic dysregulation; 2)
weight loss and weight loss maintenance: 3) precision approaches to nutrition and obesity; 4) reducing obesity
in the community; 5) nutrition, exercise, obesity in individuals with disabilities. Even more impressive has been
success of the NORC in facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations that have led to success with large grants (P
and U awards). In particular, an application for a Chronic Disease Center (P50) was just funded and an
application for a Precision Nutrition Clinical Center (UO1) received a priority score that is likely to be successful
in funding beginning in late 2021. Both of these large grants extensively use the NORC cores. Our NORC
supports three well-used core laboratories – Metabolism, Animal Models, Behavioral Science and Analytics.
The first two cores are well-established, and the third core has evolved from a biostats core to add services to
assist with different research designs, complex data analysis and behavioral science. Our NORC leadership
oversees three NIH-funded T32 training grants for obesity research. Our NORC funds a successful Pilot &
Feasibility program and sponsors a Named New Investigator. Our Enrichment Program has been outstanding
in bringing top scientists to our seminar series and in facilitating research collaborations. UAB has committed
over $5,000,000 to the NORC over the next 5 years. Backed by exceptional institutional support and academic
infrastructure, we request renewed funding to continue our contributions to this important area of research."
11167278,"Violent aggressive behavior in children has life-long consequences for perpetrators, victims, their families,
and society. Yet the biological bases of juvenile aggression remain largely unknown. This gap in knowledge
persists due to a lack of tractable models in which juvenile aggression can be readily observed and manipulated.
The proposed project takes an innovative, integrative approach to address this pressing knowledge gap using a
novel animal model. Alongside the experimental tractability of classic fish and amphibian models, poison frog
juveniles are highly aggressive, providing a powerful opportunity to understand the genomic bases of juvenile
aggression. We test the central hypothesis that distinct mechanisms mediate the acute performance of,
propensity for, and consequences of aggressive experiences. We pursue two complementary research
directions to (1) uncover the mechanistic bases of individual variation and developmental shifts in aggression,
and (2) probe the genomic and behavioral consequences of aggressive experiences for both perpetrators and
victims. To optimize risk and reward, we tackle these questions from multiple angles, combining unbiased,
exploratory approaches with characterization and manipulation of canonical candidates important for social
behavior across vertebrates, including humans. Experiences of aggression have long-lasting individual and
societal consequences and mechanistic research will have a significant positive impact by illuminating causes,
consequences, and potential treatments for violent aggression among the youngest members of our society."
10910075,"Metastasis is a complex systems problem, with critical changes across cell, tissue, organ, and organism scales.
The limited efficacy of current therapies in metastatic patients argues that we do not fully understand metastasis.
The metastatic capacity of prostate cancer (PCa) behaves along a spectrum of disease that contains an
oligometastatic state where metastases are limited in number and location. Radiation consolidation of all tumor
deposits in oligometastatic PCa to forestall further progression is now backed by small randomized studies in
the recurrent setting, but the utility in the de novo space is unknown. These are important early clinical data
suggesting the existence of an oligometastatic state and the importance of radiation consolidation in altering
underlying metastatic proclivity which has immediate impact for the management of these patients. Our U54
ROBIN Oligometastasis (ROBIN OligoMET) Center brings together pre-eminent faculty from the University of
Maryland (UM), Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) to study mechanisms of
how radiation therapy (RT) can affect the metastatic process in de novo oligometastatic PCa. This
multidisciplinary perspective enables us to bring the latest clinical trial, profiling and computational methods to
bear on the most clinically relevant aspects of oligometastasis. This in turn will lead to the development of new
approaches for using RT to combat metastases. This U54 ROBIN OligoMET Center will be led by Drs. Phuoc
Tran, Nicole Simone and Amit Sawant (MPI). Project leadership comprises faculty with strong backgrounds in
radiation biology, physics and metastasis research: Project 1 (Genomics, radiomics and liquid biopsies) is led
by Drs. Tran, Ren and Sawant; Project 2 (Metabolomics and disparities) is led by Dr. Simone; and the Resource
Sharing and Cross-Training Cores are led by Drs. Luigi Marchionni, Sawant and Ren. We bring a diversity of
model systems, experimental methods, and conceptual frameworks. The projects integrate state-of-the-art
tissue, liquid and radiomic multi-parametric profiling techniques from humans complimented with syngeneic
mouse tumor models in the context of a first-in-man phase 2 randomized trial. Data will be integrated using novel
network methods to prioritize candidates for functional validation across projects. Scientific and logistical
integration will be ensured by an Administrative Core. Multi-omics analysis and integration, quantitative image
analysis, and network analysis will be conducted in the Cross-Training Core. The ROBIN OligoMET Center will
test the global hypothesis that consolidative radiation can alter cancer cell state plasticity and host-tumor
metabolism that drives metastasis formation. AIM #1 – Identify cancer cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironment
plasticity mechanisms modulated by radiation that change metastatic proclivity. AIM #2 – Determine metabolic
changes that regulate anti-tumor immunity and metastasis in African American versus Caucasian oligometastatic
prostate cancer following SABR consolidation. AIM #3 – Multi-scale integration embedded with training initiatives
towards the elucidation of novel therapeutic vulnerabilities of metastatic cancers following consolidative SABR."
10927271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this research program is to identify therapeutic strategies to convert the stroma of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to a chemo- and immune-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME).
PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of
pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug
delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies
have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more
aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor
roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram
PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer-
associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several
coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin,
have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.
Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC
growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to
suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell
activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing
the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation
targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to
CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the
immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the
coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient-
derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents.
The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting
coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of
coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising
strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery
and efficacy."
10746434,"Project Summary/Abstract. Periodontitis, an inflammatory disease resulting in the degradation of the tooth
supporting structures often leading to tooth loss, and a risk factor for many systemic diseases, affects over 700
million people worldwide with an estimated economic burden totaling $442 billion per year. A bacterial triad
known as the `red-complex' comprising of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella
forsythia is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, it is not clearly understood why
these three pathogens are so influential in the development of periodontitis. While these bacteria produce a
number of factors to facilitate their colonization, undermine host immunity and promote subgingival polymicrobial
synergy and dysbiosis, intriguingly, all three pathogens produce sialidase (neuraminidase) - an enzyme that can
cleave terminal sialic acid from glycoproteins on the surface of epitheilial cells, immune cells and in salivary and
gingival crevicular secretions. We hypotheisize that sialidase activity of these pathogens plays a critical role in
the pathogenesis via disruption of structure-function activity of innate immune factors and liberation of sialic acid
as a nutrient as well as a precursor for surface sialylation and synthesis of vital bacterial components such as
peptidoglycan (bacterial cell-wall). In this application we will focus on the T. forsythia sialidase enzyme NanH as
the prototypical pathogen enzyme with a unique contribution in the survival of T. forsythia - an organism
auxotrophic for the peptidoglycan building block amino-sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). The NanH
sialidase activity can promote early bacterial-epithelial cell interactions, cause disruption of innate immune
responses and provide a means for the biosynthesis of MurNAc in biofilms and likely improves bacterium's
survival in the subgingival niche by reducing its reliance on cohabiting bacteria to provide MurNAc and
peptidoglycan fragments. Our hypothesis that sialic acid and peptidoglycan foraging activity of T.
forsythia exacerbates periodontitis by promoting bacterial colonization, biofilm fitness, and host
immune disruption will be addressed via: 1) Molecular level characterization of sialidase-host
interactions, 2) Defining the metabolic fate of sialic acid and the impact of sialic acid utilization on
peptidoglycan scavenging and pathogenesis, and 3) Determining the contribution of microbial sialidases
in the modulation of polymicrobial ecology and inflammation while also examining the potential of anti-
sialidase drugs such as FDA approved drugs TamiFlu (oseltamivir) in blocking periodontitis in a mouse
model. This proposal will take an in-depth approach to define the influence of host sialoglycome-pathogen
interactions from both the host and microbial standpoint. It will also focus on a novel sialo-peptidoglycan axis in
T. forsythia and define how this axis might be critical for T. forsythia fitness. Further, as a proof of principle, it will
test the therapeutic potential of pharmacological sialidase inhibitors in a mouse model to alleviate periodontal
inflammation and remodel dysbiotic ecology back to health and improve periodontitis disease outcomes."
10756473,"Project Summary
Quantitative imaging of tumor biological functions have been shown superior to imaging tumor size for
prediction and evaluation of cancer response to therapy. Conventionally used as a noninvasive imaging
method to assess microvascular perfusion and permeability, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is
increasingly employed in research and early phase clinical trial settings to measure and, importantly, predict
tumor response to treatment. The standard two- or three-parameter Tofts models (TMs) are the most
commonly used for pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of DCE-MRI data to estimate quantitative imaging
biomarkers such as Ktrans and ve. However, the TM is suboptimal in that it ignores the real physiological
phenomenon of water exchange between tissue compartments when quantifying tissue concentration of
contrast agent from MRI signal intensities. The Shutter-Speed Model (SSM) developed by the Oregon Health
& Science University (OHSU) group is a more comprehensive PK model, taking into account the
intercompartmental water exchange kinetics. Recent single-center OHSU studies have demonstrated superior
ability of SSM DCE-MRI for prediction and evaluation of therapy response in breast cancer compared to the
TM. Furthermore, it was recently discovered that the SSM-exclusive parameter, τi (mean intracellular water
lifetime), is a new imaging biomarker of metabolic activity, and was the only baseline (pre-treatment) marker
predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer and overall survival in head and
neck cancer. τi also has the advantage of being significantly less sensitive to variation in arterial input function
(AIF) than the conventional PK parameters. Using the data acquisition and analysis protocols optimized by the
OHSU group, the overall goal of this project is to validate the robustness of SSM DCE-MRI as a quantitative
imaging tool for assessment of cancer therapy response in a prospective study under a multicenter setting
across three major MRI scanner platforms, using NAC treatment of breast cancer as the testing clinical
application. Specifically, we will (1) implement the optimized SSM DCE-MRI data acquisition and analysis
protocols and perform QA/QC in a multicenter setting; (2) conduct the multicenter prospective study to validate
the utility of SSM DCE-MRI for prediction and evaluation of breast cancer response to NAC; and (3) refine an
OHSU-developed web-based clinical decision support system by developing and incorporating a predictive
model of therapy response that integrates imaging markers with clinical and histopathological data, and
evaluate the system adaptability in clinical workflow."
10800646,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Obesity develops when food intake chronically exceeds total energy expenditure. Prolonged ingestion of a
high-fat diet (HFD) results in obesity. We and others have shown that HFD induces hyperphagia; however, the
HFD effect on energy expenditure is not clear. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) effectively dissipates energy and
produces heat via BAT-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP1). BAT is innervated by stellate
ganglion sympathetic nerves (SGN) that modulate BAT thermogenesis. Our pilot studies describe a novel
hypothalamic R-spondin 1/POMC neurocircuit that mediates the central actions of insulin and leptin on BAT
thermogenesis. Separate studies show HFD reduces SGN response and UCP1 gene expression, contributing
to obesity. A higher relative abundance of gram-positive Firmicutes and fewer gram-negative Bacteroides also
occurs. Involvement of gut dysbiosis is evident as HFD fails to reduce BAT thermogenesis and cause obesity
in germ-free mice. Our objectives are to investigate mechanisms by which HFD reduces BAT thermogenesis.
We hypothesize that HFD causes gut dysbiosis, leading to elevated circulating lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a key
molecule in gram-positive bacterial cell walls; LTA, in turn, acts via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling in the
hypothalamus, reducing SGN firing and decreasing BAT thermogenesis. We will test this hypothesis with 3
specific aims: Aim 1: Define neurocircuits and signal transduction pathways in the hypothalamus responsible
for insulin and leptin actions on energy expenditure. We hypothesize that the Rspo1-LGR4/POMC/BDNF
neurocircuit mediates the central actions of insulin and leptin on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and BAT
thermogenesis. Chemical phenotyping of POMC neurons and mapping of LGR4 expressing neurons in the
ARC will be performed using in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies. Trans-synaptic tracing
studies will define the Rspo1-POMC-BDNF circuit that regulates the sympathetic outflow to BAT. Aim 2:
Investigate the effects of HFD on the hypothalamic Rspo1/POMC/BDNF neurocircuits. We hypothesize HFD
alters this neurocircuit, downregulating the actions of insulin and leptin on SNA and BAT thermogenesis, and
this is mediated by gut dysbiosis evoked by HFD. Fecal transplant from HFD mice to germ-free mice will be
used to investigate the role of HFD induced gut dysbiosis; Aim 3: Examine mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis
alters the hypothalamic neurocircuits, impairing SNA and BAT thermogenesis. We hypothesize elevated
circulating LTA caused by gram-positive gut dysbiosis acts via hypothalamic TLR2 signaling to release TNFα
which results in impaired insulin and leptin signaling and reduced SNA and decreased BAT thermogenesis.
Mouse stool microbiota analysis by MiSeq will be accompanied by stool and circulating LTA measurement.
TLR2 knockout mice will show TLR2’s critical role in impairing the hypothalamic neurocircuit response to
insulin and leptin stimulation following HFD. These studies will provide a novel explanation of how HFD
reduces BAT thermogenesis, contributing to obesity."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the largest proportion of mortality and morbidity worldwide. While a
strong body of evidence supports a role for long-term air pollution exposure in CVD among adults, relatively
little is known about how air pollution exposures may affect the development of subclinical atherogenesis in
younger populations. Early markers of these pathogenic processes, including carotid artery intima-media
thickness (CIMT), arterial stiffening (CAS), and arterial wall composition as measured by echogenicity, may
provide insight into different facets of the beginnings of disease. The lack of longitudinal studies with repeated
characterization of measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in younger populations is a major gap in the field
and it is unclear whether early life exposures to air pollutants may impact the progression of carotid
atherosclerosis from childhood into adulthood. We hypothesize that ambient and traffic-related air pollutant
exposures may influence the development of adverse subclinical cardiovascular phenotypes, indicated by
carotid atherosclerosis progression, as children grow into early adulthood. We will test this hypothesis within
the Southern California Children's Health Study (CHS), one of the largest and most comprehensive
investigations of the long-term effects of air pollution on children's health. Carotid artery ultrasounds were
performed on a subset of CHS children at age 10, providing an early measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. As
these participants now approach early adulthood (~21-23 years), we are uniquely poised to address the
question of whether lifetime air pollution exposures are associated with changes in atherosclerosis markers
from childhood into early adulthood. Using childhood carotid artery ultrasound images as a baseline measure,
we propose to leverage ongoing follow-up of CHS participants to obtain a repeat assessment of subclinical
atherosclerosis measures (CIMT and CAS), and calculate carotid echogenicity (GSM), a novel metric of arterial
wall composition, from baseline and follow-up ultrasound images. We will evaluate the effects of residential
ambient and traffic-related air pollutants on changes in these measures of subclinical atherosclerosis over
time, as well as attained level of atherosclerosis in early adulthood. We will also evaluate the relation between
air pollution exposure and biomarkers of cardiometabolic dysfunction (glucose, lipids, HbA1c), to begin to
investigate potential mechanisms underlying early atherosclerosis. This novel study will fill a critical gap in our
knowledge of subclinical atherosclerosis in children over time and investigate the impact of lifetime air pollution
exposure on early phases of disease progression."
10747323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deficits in effortful control (EC; top-down control of self-regulation involving inhibitory control and executive
attention) represent a major transdiagnostic risk factor for multiple psychiatric disorders in childhood.
Dysfunctional parenting is a strong predictor of impaired EC, making it a potent target for intervention.
Dysfunctional parenting includes behavioral deficits in parenting sensitivity [timely and appropriate responses to
changes in infant physical and emotional needs], along with cognitive deficits in maternal mind-mindedness
[MMM; attunement to infant mental states that govern goal-directed behavior]. MMM may underlie parenting
sensitivity, but prospective links remain unclear. MMM facilitates the transition from external caregiver-based
regulation to self-regulation in early childhood by providing the foundation for intentional mental-state talk to
regulate behavior. While adverse caregiving exposures have profound effects on brain structure, the extent that
MMM impacts infant brain structural and functional connectivity in key brain regions underlying EC during periods
of brain plasticity is unknown. This innovative proposal offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this
scientific question with training at an institution rich with expertise in child psychiatry and neuroscience research.
This K01 will chart the development of EC and related brain networks by leveraging a valuable captured infant
cohort undergoing repeated diffusion (dMRI) and resting state functional (rsfMRI) MRI scans and developmental
evaluations from birth to age 3 years. The applicant will add to the existing study a prospective observational
assessment of MMM, a standardized test of infant executive attention, and examine connectivity in a unique set
of white matter tracts. As the cohort is enriched for poverty, this study will examine novel links between maternal
perinatal psychosocial risk (poverty, depression, anxiety, stress) and later MMM and parenting sensitivity, and
the extent that that psychosocial risk indirectly influences EC via causally linked multiple mediators of MMM and
infant brain connectivity. Findings will elucidate MMM as a modifiable factor that may increase parent sensitivity
to enhance infant brain connectivity and EC to reduce psychopathology. [If MMM alters infant brain connectivity,
findings will underscore infancy as a critical time for targeted preventative intervention before EC deficits emerge
and lead to psychopathology; identify vulnerable infants who may benefit the most from intervention; and inform
the design of novel MMM interventions to enhance infant brain function in networks most sensitive to parenting
inputs and most related to EC.] This award will build upon the applicant's foundation in child development, school-
age executive attention, and structural MRI by providing [new and more advanced training in the assessment of
mother-infant interactions, the development of EC in infancy, and dMRI and rsfMRI methods.] The applicant will
gain the skills needed to conduct longitudinal research on the caregiving and neurobiological mechanisms of
child psychopathology. This K01 will facilitate an R01 proposal that will modify MMM in a parent-child intervention
to alter risk trajectories linking poverty with aberrant brain connectivity and psychopathology into school-age."

Regulation of Innate Immunity and Inflammation Through Nuclear Reprogramming
We propose to advance our mechanistic studies of innate immunity and inflammation in severe infections that
evolve into their end stage, septic shock, thereby threatening the lives of wounded soldiers on the battlefield, our
Veterans, and the civilian population. Those Veterans (and non-Veteran patients) between the ages of 65 to 85
are particularly prone to septic shock with a 45% mortality rate while many survivors suffer debilitating cognitive
decline. We are pursuing our long-term goal to decode innate immunity and inflammation with a new class of
cell-penetrating Nuclear Transport Modifiers (NTMs) that reprogram the inflammatory regulome. One of these
anti-inflammatory peptides achieved an unprecedented enhancement of innate immunity-mediated bacterial
clearance in the lungs (700-fold), spleen (300-fold), and blood (200-fold), all taking place before antimicrobial
therapy. Concurrently, it improved the blood markers of microvascular endothelial injury, including
thrombocytopenia. When combined with anti-microbial therapy, NTM increased the survival rate to 55%,
compared to a 30% survival rate in the antibiotic-only group. This NTM peptide, cSN50.1, simultaneously targets
two nuclear transport shuttles, importins α5 and β1. To unravel the mechanism of innate immunity and
inflammation that underlie microbial and metabolic disorders, we designed, produced, and tested two novel
mono-selective NTMs: (i) Importin α5-selective cSN50.1α, and (ii) Importin β1-selective cSN50.1β. Strikingly,
the importin α5-selective peptide produced an 80% survival rate in endotoxin shock induced by
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the most potent virulence factors of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for two
thirds of septic shock cases. This new NTM also effectively controlled the Western Diet-induced hypersensitivity
to lethal endotoxin shock while preventing liver glycogenolysis, which causes hyperglycemia and
hypertriglyceridemia linked to the nuclear transport of Carbohydrate Responsive Elements-Binding Proteins
(CHREBPs). In turn, the Imp β1-selective peptide suppressed lipogenesis mediated by the nuclear transport of
the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs) that control over 30 genes involved in the production
of triglycerides, cholesterol, and fatty acids, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome. We hypothesize that the proposed
use of selective NTMs with antimicrobial agent(s) would untangle multiorgan damage and mortality in severe
infections. Furthermore, we posit that the Importin α5/SRTFs/CHREBPs and Imp β1/SREBPs pathways are
interdependent, thereby predisposing individuals with metabolic syndrome to hyperacute responses to severe
infections. Hence, in Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanism of the NTM’s beneficial action in polymicrobial
peritonitis (i.e. the striking enhancement of the innate immunity-mediated clearance of bacteria in the lungs,
spleen, kidneys, and blood prior to antimicrobial therapy) by suppressing either Imp α5/SRTFs/ChREBPs or
Imp β1/SREBPs transport. In Aim 2, we will analyze the mechanism of the survival gain through the timed and
selective inhibition of Imp α5/SRTFs/ChREBPs or Imp β1/SREBPs transport without and with antimicrobial
therapy. The new selective NTMs will significantly deepen our mechanistic understanding of innate immunity
reprogramming using genomic and immunometabolic approaches. Thus, the new pathway-selective NTMs offer
us a unique opportunity to (i) decode the transcriptional mechanism of septic shock that integrates microbial and
metabolic inflammation and (ii) to develop clinically relevant strategies to reduce the incidence of septic shock,
increase survival, and reduce long-term cognitive decline in survivors."
10763350,"Project Summary/Abstract: The field of optogenetics — utilizing light to engage biological systems — is
widely used for the dissection of neural circuits, cellular signaling and manipulating neurophysiological systems
in awake, behaving animals. However, while many new opsins have been developed and are actively used,
challenges still remain, and the current technology lacks a full toolbox for sub-cellular, spatiotemporal control of
signaling — the predominant means for neuromodulator communication in the brain. Here we propose, an
innovative effort combining neuroscience with structural biology and high-throughput pharmacology for the
development of a series of cutting-edge novel Opto-GPCRs that will allow spatiotemporally precise and
pathway-selective control of neuromodulator signaling in vitro and in freely moving animals. In four aims across
five leading laboratories, we will develop and test these novel tools in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we will
work to 1) Develop and fully optimize OptoGPCR-v3.0 (Gi coupled) receptors for enhanced spectral
multiplexing and altered sensitivity using structure-function analysis together with mutant-library HTS landing
pad system; 2) Develop and fully optimize OptoGPCR-v3.0-Gq receptors for selective coupling to Gq signaling
pathways using structure-guidance and the HTS landing pad system; 3) Utilize databases of less-explored
naturally-occurring opsin-GPCRs to test, screen and further develop new optical tools with unique profiles; and
4) Assess the spectral compatibility for simultaneous use of OptoGPCR-v3.0 constructs in vivo, together with
biosensors using photometry, 2p imaging and concurrent behavioral measures in vivo. Successful completion
of the proposal will provide the wide neuroscience community with the long awaited capabilities of
spatiotemporal manipulation of GPCR – neuromodulator signaling within neural circuits in vitro and in vivo, in
awake freely behaving animals, and could be used for a wide variety of applications. This new technology will
also further widen the field for unique optical approaches that allow discrete control and optodynamic
simulation of neuromodulator function in brain tissue. We therefore believe that by the fulfilment of these goals
we directly address the central purpose of this RFA-NS-21-027 call."
10695928,"Project Summary / Abstract
 It has recently been discovered that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) can be regulated by
extracellular interactions. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly understood. One such
interaction is the trans-synaptic connection between presynaptic group III metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluR) and postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type
III domain-containing (ELFN) family. Group III mGluRs sense glutamate release and inhibit further release in a
negative feedback mechanism. A great body of evidence points to the essential role of synaptic glutamate
homeostasis in a range of cognitive and motor functions with dysregulation leading to movement disorders and
epilepsy. Binding and stabilization of mGluRs by trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN proteins is critical for
regulating glutamate homeostasis. Loss of ELFN proteins in mice tremendously augments glutamate release
and results in seizures and hyperactivity. Understanding how these proteins interact in the synaptic environment
will provide valuable insight into how neurons maintain control over glutamate levels in the synapse and has
implications for physiology and disease. Importantly, both mGluRs and ELFN proteins have been shown to form
homo- and hetero-dimers. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that apart from positioning and stabilizing
group III mGluRs at the synapses, ELFN proteins act to allosterically modulate mGluR activity in part by
influencing the dimerization dynamics of mGluR subunits. To test this hypothesis, I will build a structural model
of the ELFN-mGluR interaction using crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry, hydrogen/deuterium
exchange, and cryo-electron microscopy to understand what binding determinants govern the ELFN-mGluR
binding interaction. Additionally, I will investigate the mechanisms of mGluR allosteric modulation by ELFN
proteins using a variety of cell-based signaling assays. Together, these experiments will provide a clear
foundation for understanding how the brain maintains glutamate homeostasis inside the synapse."

In this new and unfunded study, we will capitalize on the lessons from the past 15 years of psychiatric
genomic. Based on these lessons, we propose an exceptionally novel and important set of aims to further
knowledge of the genetic architecture of mental illness. We propose to perform whole-exome sequencing and
SNP-array genotyping on >150,000 cases with severe psychiatric disorders along with a similar number of
controls. It will be large, transdiagnostic, based on patients seen in clinical psychiatry, and comprehensively
analyze ultra-rare exonic, rare copy number, and common variation. Because assay costs are prohibitive (on
the order of $US 80 million), we are partnering with Regeneron Genomics Center (RGC) that will conduct all
genomic assays. NIMH funding is within the $500K direct cost cap at each site.
We will: (1) Acquire samples with clinically severe psychiatric disorders. Cases will have lifetime diagnoses of
schizophrenia (SCZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), bipolar I disorder (BD1), or severe major depressive
disorder (sevMDD). Roles: UNC is responsible for data coordination; the sampling sites are ISMMS (the
Americas and East Asia) and Cardiff (Europe, Africa, and South Asia) and each will collate samples (i.e.,
MTAs, ethical approvals, individual consent, harmonize phenotypes, QC DNA). Phase 1 (Years 1-2) will focus
on existing samples (N=100K cases). Phase 2 (Years 1-4) will focus on obtaining new samples (N=50K
cases), and will enable colleagues from low-income countries to obtain genetic data that would otherwise be
impossible. This will help those investigators and greatly increase diversity in genomics research. 2) Genomic
assays (Years 1-4). Samples will be sent to RGC in batches from ISMMS and Cardiff. RGC will generate whole
exome sequencing and SNP array data. UNC and RGC will jointly conduct alignment, QC, variant calling
(SNVs, indels, SVs), and array processing (common SNPs, imputation and CNVs). QC includes assessment of
multiple biases and comparison to independent datasets. Deliverable: analysis-ready data frames for rare
exonic, rare CNV, and common genetic variation. 3) Analysis for substantive scientific aims. Briefly, the main
analytical themes are to identify genetic variation associated with: (a) severe mental illness, (b) specific
disorders, and (c) cross-cutting clinical features (e.g., psychosis, treatment resistance, mania, ID). All analyses
will be conducted using robust methods/bias control, formally compared to relevant prior studies, and evaluate
the impact of all types of measured genetic variation across diverse genetic ancestries. 4) Data sharing will
align with NIMH policies via the NIMH Data Archive.
Successful completion of the proposed work will markedly increase the number of genes pinpointed by
burdens of rare coding variation, rare CNVs, as well as less specific GWAS associations–we will markedly
increase knowledge of the genetic architectures of these critically important and burdensome disorders."
10880514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Across all cancers a significant problem in oncology is the current lack of reliable means to predict response to
anti-cancer treatments for individual patients. Specifically in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), it is known
that patients can benefit from chemotherapy, radiation, and operative management. However, not all of these
therapies may be required for each individual patient. With standard practices, patients are exposed to the
toxicities of all of these modalities without knowing the necessity of each. In addition, for some patients they
require escalation of therapies beyond these due to resistant disease. A method to predict treatment response
is urgently needed to better tailor the neoadjuvant treatment paradigm for individual patients and this is the goal
of this proposal. The long-term objective of this proposal is to utilize optical metabolic imaging (OMI) of patient-
derived colorectal cancer (CRC) organoid cultures to predict sensitivity to therapeutic regimens. This proposal
develops novel cellular-level imaging technologies to predict treatment response in individual cancer patients
using optical metabolic imaging (OMI) of organoids cultures from their own tumors. Since tumor genetics can
have profound impacts on cellular metabolism, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which
tumor genetics alter OMI in the pre- and post-treatment settings is needed. In addition, assessment of cell-level
heterogeneity within patient samples is required to fully predict the treatment response. To interrogate these
mechanistic inquiries, we have generated multiple tools and research techniques. Our data to date indicate that
OMI in primary CRCs and other tumor types predicts in vivo drug response in mice and patients.
In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that OMI of patient-derived organoid cultures will predict treatment
response for patients with CRC undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation. In this extension proposal, we build
on the prior aims to assess the use of OMI to evaluate clonal evolution and correlate these studies with molecular
evolution of these cells. Additionally, we further validate the OMI response thresholds to predict treatment
response identified in our initial aims with an additional cohort of CRC patients. Finally, we will perform a
multivariate analysis to evaluate multiple OMI parameters in combination with change in organoid diameter,
response on clinical imaging, pre-treatment clinical stage, age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinical treatment dose
intensity, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte counts, and the molecular profile as predictors of clinical outcomes for
these CRC patients. Overall, these additional aims represent logical extensions of the initial aims and will be key
to further supporting the incorporation of OMI of patient-derived organoids into future prospective clinical trials."

This Phase 2 renewal is premised upon the prior success of the “Center for Translational Viral Oncology” (CTVO)
and upon evolving research themes that leverage new faculty expertise and health-disparate, cancer prone
populations in our region. Virus-induced malignancies, such as human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced
anogenital, and KSHV-associated Kaposi Sarcomas are highly prevalent in Louisiana and occur at increased
incidence in people living with HIV. Given the regional need for viral cancer research, CTVO Phase 2 is essential
to: 1) sustain the career development of talented Junior Principal Investigators (JPIs); 2) to support existing and
coalescing research between regional scientists in viral oncology; and 3) to reinforce the institutionalization of
productive core facilities. The overarching goal of CTVO is to improve disease management and quality of life
across the diverse spectrum of Louisiana cancer patients through responsive research activity. Our immediate
goal is to comprehensively prepare young investigators to conduct cutting edge viral oncology research
and to better define how HIV co-infection predisposes many malignancies. As part of this goal CTVO will
continue to reinforce collaborations between existing cancer virology and COBRE programs at LSU New
Orleans, LSU Baton Rouge, LSU Shreveport, and Tulane University, to form a highly productive collaborative
network, as part of the Louisiana IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE). The CTVO will
support the scientific, mentoring and administrative needs of the JPIs by providing (i) mentoring teams
composed of NIH-funded basic science and clinical investigators dedicated to guiding JPI research project
implementation and career development; (ii) unique clinical material consisting of annotated biospecimens
collected from HIV+ and HIV- patients with virus-associated cancers at the University Medical Center, New
Orleans; (iii) a supportive administrative core (ADMIN) to facilitate mentoring networking, career
development, and critical external evaluation; (iv) dynamic research core facilities including the HIV clinical
tumor biorepository (HCTB), a molecular histopathology/analytical microscopy core (MHAM), a cellular
immunology/metabolomics core (CIMC), a translational genomics core (TGC), and a biostatistics and
bioinformatics core (BBC), which were specifically designed to assist in state-of-the-art JPI research endeavors.
CTVO focuses this structure on four JPI-led research projects that 1) study HIV-1's impact on immune
reprogramming to predispose neoplasia, 2) seek to define the molecular underpinnings of Kaposi's Sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency and tumorigenesis, 3) investigate interactions between human papilloma
virus (HPV) and Epstein–Bar virus (EBV) in anogenital cancer, and 4) test relationships between human
endogenous retroviral (HERV) expression and glioblastoma stemness and drug resistance. Finally, a pilot
research program will ensue to support focused research that will promote CTVO dynamic growth."

10843808,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common orthopedic injury that results in persistent quadriceps
weakness that drives poor patient outcomes and increases the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA).
Despite extensive rehabilitation, and regardless of whether the ACL is surgically reconstructed, only 1 in 5
patients regain acceptable levels of quadriceps strength. As ACL injury causes an immediate shutdown of
neural signaling, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly prescribed to activate inhibited
motoneurons, thereby improving quadriceps activation and permitting strength recovery. Although NMES is
widely used, our own meta-analysis and other data show that the clinical success is inconsistent, likely due to
tremendous diversity in stimulation intensities and how soon treatments are initiated after injury. Research that
improves our understanding of the optimal intensity and timing of this treatment to maximize its effectiveness
would be immediately impactful. Our new breakthrough data highlight an important and overlooked relationship
between the loss of neural activation and mitochondrial dysfunction as important contributors to muscle deficits
after ACL injury. Neural inhibition, i.e., the loss of action potentials, disrupts post-synaptic calcium signaling
that triggers mitochondria to produce excess reactive oxygen species known to severely compromise muscle
health. These data reinforce our rationale to optimize NMES as this therapy can directly depolarize inhibited
motoneurons in the absence of volitional neural activation to maintain the electrical properties of muscle
necessary for contraction and mitochondrial health. To understand how to optimize the delivery, we developed
a non-invasive rat model that faithfully replicates the clinical injury. The objective of this proposal is to use this
preclinical model to test specific NMES treatment parameters and the underlying mechanisms of action. Aim 1
will define the intensity and time of treatment initiation that maximizes positive muscle outcomes using a
custom-built rodent dynamometer that will translate the intensity of stimulus and strength outcomes to the
human condition. Aim 2 will test the ability of optimized NMES to be protective of knee joint health by reducing
risk factors for PTOA after ACL injury. Aim 3 will determine the clinical importance between the loss of neural
activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and explore whether future clinical applications should consider the
concurrent use of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant therapies after ACL injury. As NMES is part of the
standard of care for ACL injury, this work will provide fundamental knowledge to guide clinical practice."

10863919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 7 million adults ages 65 and older are hospitalized in the US annually, of whom two-thirds have multiple
chronic conditions. Older adults are often discharged with changes to medications for chronic conditions, such
as hypertension and diabetes, which are not directly related to their reason for hospitalization. In current
practice, neither prior chronic disease control nor key geriatric issues such as multimorbidity, polypharmacy, or
cognition appear to influence discharge prescribing decisions. There is an urgent need to reorient the current
approach to hospital management of older adults’ chronic conditions from a number-driven to a patient-
centered decision-making process. Treatment guidelines have not been designed to inform decisions for
hospitalized older adults, who more often face multimorbidity and, while recovering from acute illness, may
face transient cognitive and functional decline and long-term changes in prognosis that impact both risks and
benefits of chronic disease medications. Although substantial efforts have been made to improve discharge
medication reconciliation, little focus has been placed on understanding clinician rationale for changing chronic
medications or patient rationale for non-persistence to changes, which may include ADEs or poor
communication of changes. My long-term goal is to become a national leader in improving the safety and
quality of chronic disease management for older adults across transitions of care. The objectives of this
proposal are to conduct a prospective cohort study to address current knowledge gaps on the clinician
rationale for chronic medication changes prescribed at discharge and subsequent patient outcomes. This novel
information will inform the development and pilot testing of a clinical decision framework which will incorporate
geriatric principles to individualize discharge prescribing decisions for hospitalized older adults, focusing on 2
exemplar conditions: hypertension and diabetes. Mentored by a superb team of experts in aging research,
hospital medicine, pharmacoepidemiology, and clinician-focused intervention development, I will: 1) Conduct a
prospective mixed-methods cohort study of older adults discharged from the hospital with chronic medication
changes to evaluate clinician’s reasons for making medication changes, older adults' understanding of
changes, and patient-reported outcomes following changes; 2) Develop and refine a clinical decision
framework for individualizing discharge diabetes and hypertension prescribing decisions for hospitalized older
adults 3) Conduct a pilot pretest-posttest trial to learn if providing the clinical decision framework tool to
facilitates self-efficacy to individualize prescribing decisions and leads to improved patient understanding of
medication changes. This proposal will produce an innovative geriatrics-informed approach for chronic
condition prescribing decisions for hospitalized older adults. Completion of the proposal will position me as a
national leader in peri-hospitalization care of older adults and provide me the foundational knowledge, skills,
and experiences necessary to design and test interventions to improve prescribing decisions"

While evidence-based behavioral treatments for adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) are well-established, these interventions most often fail to generalize across settings and are
associated with intervention effects that dissipate over time. The current proposal takes a theory-driven,
empirical approach for optimizing existing behavioral treatment by targeting adolescents’ skills utilization and
engaging other modifiable factors associated with trajectories of ADHD-related impairment including reward
sensitivity, motivation, executive functioning, and social support. Mobile technologies offer transformative
opportunities for engaging these targets and overcoming the notorious challenges impeding treatment
adherence for adolescents with ADHD. This mentored K23 award will support the candidate in developing an
independent research career investigating innovative approaches for optimizing treatment response for youth
with ADHD. This K23 is designed to provide the necessary training to become an expert in leveraging
technology-enhanced resources to target behavioral skill utilization in order to enhance treatment response
and promote sustained improvement. This award will provide the candidate with advanced training in: (1)
interactive health technologies; (2) adherence promotion; (3) methods and statistical approaches for ecological
valid, real time assessment and adaptive intervention designs; and (4) mechanism-based intervention
refinement and evaluation; and (5) grant writing skills and research dissemination. Through the University of
California, San Francisco (USCF) Laboratory for Hyperactivity, Attention, and Learning Problems (HALP) and
the UCSF’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Award, the candidate is uniquely equipped with
resources to achieve her training objectives and complete this research. The mentorship team includes senior
level investigators with active federally-funded research, experience mentoring early-career investigators, and
expertise in: implementing persuasive technology for adherence and behavior change (Lyles), user-centered
design, development, and evaluation with adolescents (Ozer), human-computer interaction and gamification
(Gazzaley), ecological skills assessment (Lindhiem), adaptive intervention designs with digital tools (Murphy),
and mechanisms underlying interventions (Pfiffner; HALP Director, primary mentor). Applying this training, the
proposed research will use an iterative stakeholder-centered design to develop, refine, and preliminarily test a
scalable digital health tool, applied as an adjunct to behavioral treatment for adolescents with ADHD (ages 11-
14). Following usability testing to guide refinements, a small pilot RCT (N=60) will examine target engagement
and validation (skills utilization) for promoting enhanced and evaluate the feasibility of this novel tool when
integrated with treatment delivery. The training, mentorship, and research supported by this K23 will facilitate
the candidate in designing the next phase of this research, a large-scale adaptive intervention trial (R01) that
delivers personalized strategies to optimize treatment engagement and skills utilization in real time."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the 2nd most common cause of cancer mortality. Nearly all
patients suffering from Lynch Syndrome as well as 15-20% of patients with sporadic early CRC
have microsatellite instability (MSI) due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Notably,
defective MMR by itself is not sufficient to drive cell transformation and tumorigenesis, but
microsatellite mutations in a limited number of target genes might be positively selected during
tumor development, underlying MSI-associated pathogenesis. Unfortunately, relatively little is
known about the molecular underpinnings of MSI target genes and their mechanism of action in
MSI-associated disease penetrance. This project will fill this gap, capitalizing on our recent
discovery of a strong correlation between the MSI phenotype and recurrent frameshift (FS)
mutation in the autophagy tumor suppressor UVRAG. The protein product of this FS mutation
functions as an oncogene and a bona fide trigger of centrosome amplification (CA) in CRC. We
now bring within this proposal a collaboration of leaders in CRC genetics and molecular biology
along with clinicians and pathologists to understand the molecular mechanism by which CA
augments the expressivity of MMR mutations, contributing to human colonic carcinogenesis. To
achieve this goal, we propose three Specific Aims, including (1) identifying the molecular
mechanism of CA in MSI CRC associated with UVRAGFS expression; (2) examining the impact
of CA on the differentiation and metastatic capacity of MSI patient-derived colonic organoids;
and (3) investigating the in vivo role of MSI-derived UVRAGFS in disease penetrance and cancer
progression using targeted mutant mouse models. These aims will be addressed using
multidisciplinary innovative approaches that integrate state-of-the-art genetic, biochemistry, live-
cell imaging, and physiological assays in cells and in mice with targeted mutations in genes
related to MMR deficiency and centrosome deregulation. We have access to the right cohort of
patients and our use of patient-derived colonic organoids will maximize the relevance of our
findings for eventual translation to cancer patients in the clinic. Together, we anticipate that our
studies will delineate a novel mechanism underlying MSI-associated disease penetrance and
provide compelling in vivo validation of CA as a novel prognostic and predictive biomarker and a
therapeutic target for personalized treatment of MSI CRC including Lynch Syndrome."
10741825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At the center of the pathogenesis of allergic diseases is the IgE molecule. In sensitized individuals, re-
exposure to the offending allergen results in IgE engagement, causing Fcε receptor cross-linking and
activation of mast cells and basophils. This triggers the release of mediators into the local tissue, resulting in
the vast array of symptoms associated with allergic diseases, including anaphylactic shock. To date, studies
of the human IgE molecule, and its targeted epitopes on allergens, have been very limited. Most of our
knowledge of this process has come from studies using allergic patient serum, which contains a mixture of
many antibodies, with many specificities, directed toward many different epitopes, and having many
different affinities; thus the studies of the molecular interactions of IgE with target allergens are greatly
flawed. The ideal way to study this process is to use naturally-occurring human IgE monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs), isolated from allergic subjects. Unfortunately, due to many impassible intrinsic technical hurdles no
such antibodies have previously ever been made. We have now established a method to grow, identify and
immortalize IgE encoding B cells by making human hybridomas from the peripheral blood of allergic
individuals. In this proposal, we develop the first comprehensive panels of naturally-occurring peanut
allergen-specific human IgE mAbs to define the molecular interactions of the most potent inducers of
anaphylaxis. We have already begun comprehensive mapping studies to identify key immunodominant
antigenic sites on the major peanut allergen proteins Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 6. In Aim 1, functional antigenic site
mapping via peanut induced anaphylaxis will be accomplished by passive sensitization of human FcεRI
transgenic mice using IgE mAbs. In Aim 2, prototype mAbs that bind unique antigenic sites will be selected
and expressed as recombinant IgG mAbs to use as tools for advanced mapping studies using human
serum. IgG mAbs, which bind identically as the IgE mAbs from which they were made, will be employed in
blocking studies using a panel of peanut allergic research subjects’ frozen serum and ImmunoCAP
diagnostics. This will define the role that each antigenic site-specific population of IgE antibodies play within
and between peanut allergic individuals. This information will be used to draw clinical correlates of disease
and to select research subjects which possess IgE antibodies not blocked by our panels, allowing for the
generation of new site-specific IgE mAbs in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3, we will obtain atomic resolution
structures to precisely define the first ever naturally-occurring human IgE epitopes on Ara h 2 and 6 by X-
ray crystallography. The goal of this work is to create a definitive, complete and comprehensive molecular
map of the human IgE antibody response to the major allergen proteins of peanut. The results will serve as
a much-needed road map to allow for the design of new immunotherapies and allergy vaccines."

The objective of this NIH R01 proposal is to develop a non-immunogenic, injectable depot of a PEG-like
conjugate of a peptide drug for systemic drug delivery. This proposal is motivated by the fact that many peptide
and protein drugs have a short plasma half-life on the order of minutes to a few hours. PEGylation —the
conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties to biologics— is commonly used to overcome these
limitations. Unfortunately, PEG is antigenic, which has led to the early termination of a Phase III clinical trial of a
PEGylated drug candidate and withdrawal of several PEGylated drugs from the market because of severe
allergic reactions in some patients. These problems have been traced to circulating anti-PEG antibodies that are
found even in individuals who have not previously received a PEGylated drug. Furthermore, the improvement in
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) conferred by PEG and its branched derivatives are now at
an asymptote. This proposal addresses the urgent, unmet need to develop the next-generation of PEGylation
that overcomes these limitations. We hypothesize that we can solve the immunogenicity problem of PEG
conjugates and further extend the half-life of PEG conjugates by a next generation PEG-like “stealth” polymer,
poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA) that presents short oligomeric ethylene glycol
(OEG) side-chains on a backbone. This hypothesis is validated by our preliminary data that shows that reactivity
towards patient-derived anti-PEG antibodies is eliminated by shortening the OEG side-chain length to ≤3 without
compromising PK or PD, and that a copolymer with a mixture of two and three EG long side-chains also allows
POEGMA to reversibly transition from a solution into an insoluble coacervate between 25-37 ºC, thereby enabling
the creation of a sustained release depot. We will demonstrate the utility of this non-immunogenic, injectable
drug depot by synthesizing POEGMA conjugates of exendin —a potent but short-acting clinically approved
peptide drug for type 2 diabetes— and show that exendin-POEGMA conjugates are pharmacologically active,
form a depot upon subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in diabetic mice, show zero-order release kinetics into the
bloodstream from the depot, leading to sustained glucose control in diabetic (db/db) mice, while simultaneously
eliminating PEG immunogenicity and antigenicity. The overall significance of this research is that it will solve
the problem of PEG antigenicity and will also improve upon the PK and PD of PEG conjugates by creating an
injectable PEG conjugate that forms a s.c. depot with sustained release of the drug. By doing so, it will breathe
new life into an established drug delivery technology that is now beginning to show its age. More specifically, it
will also enable improved management of type diabetes for the ~30 million Americans who are diabetic. Because
the POEGMA conjugate technology can likely be applied to the many therapeutics —beyond exendin— that
have a short plasma half-life and where anti-PEG antibodies are of concern, it has the potential to have broad
impact."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. Standard of care is surgical resection
followed by treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). However, two major challenges make GBM
currently untreatable: 1) its diffuse invasion beyond the surgical margin; and 2) TMZ resistance that is tightly
linked to expression of the DNA damage repair protein MGMT. While perivascular niches (PVNs) extending from
the tumor into the surrounding parenchyma are believed to regulate invasion, recurrence, and poor survival, the
majority of animal glioma models are sensitive to TMZ and most do not express MGMT, making it difficult to
assess novel therapeutics in animal models that don’t display TMZ resistance. This Cancer Tissue Engineering
Collaborative project will develop and thoroughly characterize a multidimensional engineered PVN biomaterial,
study pathophysiological processes driving GBM invasion and TMZ resistance, and accelerate the evaluation of
novel TMZ derivatives created to target diffuse GBM cells regardless of MGMT status. We will use advanced
microfluidics to create libraries of miniaturized gelatin hydrogels containing margin-mimetic hyaluronic acid (HA)
and an embedded perivascular network. We also use a novel synthetic pipeline to create TMZ derivatives that
generate alternate DNA modifications that cannot be removed by MGMT that we hypothesize work in an MGMT-
independent fashion. Merging these technologies, we will benchmark an engineered PVN platform formed using
primary brain neurovascular cells for rapid evaluation of GBM invasion, MGMT expression, and TMZ resistance
amenable to analysis of cell lines and patient-derived GBM specimens with disparate MGMT profiles. To do this,
we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will use this
novel biomaterial to benchmark patterns of invasion and MGMT expression in GBM cell lines (Aim 2). Finally,
we will establish predictive efficacy of TMZ variants in an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 3). Together, we
will develop, characterize, and benchmark a tissue engineered PVN to examine the role of microenvironmental
selection pressures in the tumor margin on behaviors related to invasion, MGMT-mediated TMZ resistance,
recurrence, and poor survival. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the CTEC program, we will develop and
thoroughly characterize an engineered PVN biomaterial, show it fits within the continuum of existing cancer
models, use it to examine phenomena underlying the failure to achieve durable survival, and gain actionable
insight regarding novel TMZ derivatives with potential to effectively target GBM cells in the margins independent
of MGMT status."

Many types of cancer harbor disease-sustaining tumor cells, or tumor-initiating cells (TICs), that play a pivotal
role in cancer development. TICs have been implicated in drug resistance and tumor recurrence, making them
a rational target for therapeutic intervention. However, methods for destabilizing TICs have not been as evident
as was initially hoped. The long-term goal of my research program is to identify cellular crosstalk and molecular
pathways involved in the regulation of stem cells in tissue homeostasis and cancer development. Just as
normal stem cells are regulated by external cues derived from specialized microenvironments or stem cell
niches, the stem-like state and malignant properties of TICs are controlled by various factors emanating from
the TIC-associated microenvironment, the so-called TIC niche. Therefore, targeting the crosstalk between TICs
and the niche is an attractive avenue for durable cancer therapy. While solid tumors are known to recruit
immune cells in the stroma and create favorable conditions for their growth and survival, little is known about
how TICs regulate the localization and function of tumor-supportive immune cells in their spatial proximity. Our
incomplete understanding of the complexity of the niche and the plasticity of TICs is a significant barrier to
improving therapeutic efficacy. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) exhibits high rates of recurrence
driven by therapy-resistant TICs at the tumor-stroma interface, making it a rational model to study the crosstalk
between TICs and the potential niche cells. We previously devised a de novo SCC mouse model that allows us
to label and lineage trace TGF--responding tumor cells. Through this approach, we have demonstrated that
tumor cells responding to paracrine TGF- signaling promote invasive tumor progression. Moreover, TGF--
responding tumor cells function as drug-resistant TICs through activation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant
metabolism and drive tumor recurrence. Therefore, the mechanisms that lead to “TGF--rich” tumor
microenvironments may precede the development of TIC–niche interactions, which could potentially be
exploited as a new target for destabilizing TICs. Recently, we found that TICs release IL-33 through TIC-
intrinsic stress-resistant activities, which induces the accumulation of a subset of macrophages in close
proximity of TICs. These IL-33-responding macrophages are alternatively-activated and send reciprocal TGF-
signaling to induce invasive and drug-resistant properties in TICs. Based on our preliminary data, our central
hypothesis is that the IL-33–TGF- paracrine signaling loop constitutes a feedforward mechanism that
promotes the formation of a robust TIC niche, in which both tumor-promoting functions of macrophages and
malignant properties of TICs are induced. Here we will determine the mechanism of tumor-promoting niche
formation and malignant transformation of TICs, which could help identify the vulnerability of TICs to combat
therapy-resistant cancers."

There is an urgent need to nominate biomarkers that are likely to predict the efficacy of radiotherapy and
accelerate their clinical translation. Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the genetic features
regulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied
on a large-scale. Our group completed the largest profiling effort of survival after radiation in cancer cell lines,
comprising a diverse collection of 533 genetically annotated tumor cell lines from 26 cancer types. To
complement this work, we recently initiated the systematic profiling of >1000 genetic variants that could
potentially contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. We combined results from our profiling efforts
to identify features that predict the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. The objective in this investigation
is to advance the clinical translation of two of the most important regulators of radiation resistance in lung cancer,
Nrf2 and Braf. The Nrf2 pathway is genetically altered in ~28% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and cells with mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 are the most highly correlated with resistance to
radiation. To identify genetic dependencies of Nrf2-active tumors, we used computational and experimental
approaches to demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence between Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
alteration in NSCLCs. Using genetic and chemical means we show that antagonizing the catalytic subunit of
PI3K, p110 (encoded by PIK3CA), decreases Nrf2 activity and reverses radiation resistance driven by this
pathway. These results provide the rationale to advance a radiosensitization strategy for patients with Nrf2-active
NSCLC by targeting PI3K. Our profiling efforts also demonstrate a critical role for BRAF, which is genetically
altered in ~7% of patients with NSCLC, in the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. We show, for the first
time, that BRAF kinase domain mutations confer resistance to radiation in lung cancers and that they, unlike
Nrf2 pathway alterations, are almost invariably a minor component of the tumor (i.e. they are subclonal). We use
mathematical and experimental models to show that clonal architecture has significant implications for the
likelihood of response to targeted therapies and radiation. Together, these results provide a compelling rationale
to examine the role of Nrf2 and Braf alterations in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy and advance a
genomically-guided radiosensitization strategy for patients with these tumors. If these hypotheses are correct,
our results will demonstrate that radiotherapeutic sensitizers can be selected based on both the identity and type
(clonal v. subclonal) of genetic alterations identified in a patient's cancer, prompting an evolution in the use of
radiation from a generic approach to one that is guided by the genetic composition of individual tumors."

Hypoxia is one of the key microenvironmental factors that impinges upon tumor progression and metastasis of
solid tumors such as breast cancer. While evaluating the impact of hypoxia, our group made an unanticipated
but striking observation that in chronic hypoxia, mammary tumors display a remarkable increase in the number
of nucleoli per cell. We found that this increase is concomitant with upregulated activity of the nucleolus. In the
nucleolus, RNA Pol I transcribes rDNA (contains the sequences of 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs) to drive ribosome
biogenesis. We contend that this increased ribosome biogenesis is essential for hypoxic cell survival and
subsequent disease progression. In response to hypoxia, nucleolar ERK signaling activity is increased.
Increased ERK directly impinges upon the activity of UBF, a nucleolus-specific transcription activator, which
activates RNA Pol I. We contend that this increased nucleolar activity is a vulnerability of hypoxic tumor cells.
Our objective is to test an approach to exploit the dependence of hypoxic breast cancer cells on ERK activation.
We contend that debilitating the rRNA biogenesis following nucleolar ERK activation following hypoxic stress will
remarkably restrict the tumor growth and metastatic spread of breast cancer cells. To test this, we will adopt
carefully designed cellular and animal experimental approaches to test the effect of antagonizing ERK and RNA
Pol I activity on metastatic progression. Additionally, we will identify mechanistic details of nucleolar ERK
functions. Overall, our work will reveal novel aspects of nucleolar ERK response of tumor cells that support their
survival and metastatic ability under hypoxia."
11194039,"SUMMARY
The human genome supports billions of potential variants, and the number of variants detected through
genome sequencing continues to grow rapidly. However, our ability to interpret these variants and identify
those responsible for disease phenotypes still lags. Statistical methods such as genome-wide association
studies struggle with rare or de novo mutations. Approaches based on sequence conservation are less reliable
for the vast majority of variants that fall outside protein coding sequences. These shortcomings of traditional
approaches motivate the development of models for variant stratification. Functional models aim to quantify
how a genetic variant impacts a molecular phenotype -- transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, stability,
translation, and more -- thus creating a link between a variant and an organismal phenotype. Crucially, such
sequence-to-function models can generalize from training data to unseen sequences by learning the regulatory
rules underlying the observed molecular phenotype, thus making it possible to even predict the impact of rare
variants on the process under investigation. In prior work, we showed that models learned from massive
numbers of synthetic reporter constructs could strongly outperform models learned from the comparably small
number of natural examples even in predicting the impact of variants on gene expression in humans. Here, we
extend our work combining synthetic biology with machine learning to build and integrate predictive models of
mRNA stability and translation. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to conduct high-throughput reporter assays to
characterize how variants in both coding and untranslated regions impact mRNA stability and translation.
Regulatory rules are often position-dependent, and a particular sequence motif might have a vastly different
impact on gene expression depending on its location. We thus propose to develop MPRAs that interrogate
CDS as well as 5’ and 3’UTR variants. Furthermore, we propose to perform stability and translation MPRAs
with multiple cell types to uncover aspects of cell type-specific regulation. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to
develop machine learning approaches that enable us to integrate results from multiple measurements and
generalize predictive rules learned from such assays. Additionally, we will apply a deep learning model
interpretation method developed in our lab to generate hypotheses about biological mechanisms, which will be
confirmed via MPRAs in knockdown cell lines. In Specific Aim 3, we propose to develop a novel type of
reporter assay that allows us to directly measure the impact of sequence variation on protein levels using
high-throughput nanopore sequencing of protein-level barcodes. The use of this protein barcoding technology
will improve the resolution, specificity and accuracy of protein measurements by going beyond ribosome
loading measurements, reducing the potential for false positives and negatives."

10690521,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Mycosis Fungoides/Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (MF/CTCL) is a rare, indolent Non-Hodgkin's
Lymphoma (NHL), without a known cure, that presents as skin patches, plaques, tumors, or
erythroderma with significant morbidity and impact on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).
Effective early treatment improves HR-QoL and may prevent disease progression. As per current
NCCN guidelines, many skin-directed therapies (SDTs) are used for the treatment of early stage
MF/CTCL including topicals, ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy, and radiation therapy. None have
been FDA-approved for first-line therapy and most are used off-label. Given the chronic, recurrent
nature of MF/CTCL, most patients require repeat courses of therapy and trying other therapies.
The use of several SDTs are limited by skin irritation/dermatitis and long-term cumulative toxicity.
Given this, there is an urgent need for additional SDTs for CTCL with fewer side effects. Topical
hypericin is non-mutagenic, not systemically absorbed, activated by noncarcinogenic visible light,
selectively taken up by tumor cells in the skin (up to 10-fold) and induces mitochondrial apoptosis.
Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies in MF/CTCL have demonstrated safety and efficacy. A recent
multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded Phase 3 study, enrolled 169 patients with
Stage IA, IB or IIA CTCL and administered treatments twice weekly for at least 6 weeks (Cycle
1). In Cycle 1, 116 subjects received SGX301 to 3 index lesions with an overall response rate
(ORR) of 16% compared to placebo ORR 4% (n=50, p=0.04). In Cycle 2 the ORR in patients
receiving SGX301 for both cycles (12 weeks) was 40% (p<0.0001 vs placebo or 6 weeks of
treatment). SGX301 treatment is safe and well tolerated, with potential favorable long-term safety
given its mode of action. Although the trial showed efficacy, the dosing regimen was inflexible and
short duration vs other skin-directed therapies where peak ORR can take 4-24 months of
treatment. The current proposal will study SGX301 efficacy/safety utilizing a continuous treatment
schedule for up to 1 year in an open label, multicenter clinical trial of 50 patients over 6 sites. The
Specific Aims are: 1: Define optimal duration of SGX301 therapy to maximal ORR in early stage
MF/CTCL patients on a “real world” treatment schedule up to 12 months. 2: Define safety profile
during treatment. 3: Assess efficacy of SGX301 in disease subtypes and different skin lesions
(patch vs plaque). 4: Assess genomic changes in skin/peripheral blood (utilizing high throughput
sequencing [HTS-PCR] and targeted next generation sequencing [NGS]) and apoptosis markers
(utilizing immunohistochemistry) as correlates of clinical response to SGX301 therapy."
10829797,"Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. The widespread adoption of low dose
computed tomography (LDCT) screening enables the early detection of LC and is expected to increase the
number of long-term LC survivors. While recent studies show that LC survivors have a high risk of developing
second primary lung cancer (SPLC), no consensus screening guidelines exist for SPLC among LC survivors.
The long-term goal of the parent R37 is to reduce the overall LC mortality in the U.S. by focusing on SPLC. The
overall objectives of the parent R37 are (i) to identify the genetic, clinical, and environmental determinants for
SPLC, (ii) to assess an individual’s risk of SPLC, and (iii) to evaluate efficient LDCT screening strategies for
SPLC for LC survivors. During Years 1- 3 of the parent R37 study, we made substantial progress in achieving
these objectives. We developed a risk prediction model for SPLC that incorporates smoking history (measured
before IPLC diagnosis), IPLC tumor characteristics, and medical history that is implemented in an open access
application, called Second Primary Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (SPLC-RAT). Despite this progress, we
observed several major challenges, including the lack of validation of SPLC-RAT using diverse LC patients
including heavy smokers and long-term LC survivors. Another major challenge is how to incorporate smoking
behavioral changes after IPLC diagnosis (e.g., smoking cessation) into risk-assessment of SPLC. To address
these major challenges from the existing R37 study, our aims of this extension R37 study are: (AIM 1) To validate
SPLC-RAT using diverse LC patients with a wide range of smoking histories and to re-calibrate the parameters
of SPLC-RAT for long-term survivors; (AIM 2) To determine the impact of smoking cessation after IPLC diagnosis
on SPLC risk and LC mortality; (AIM 3) To evaluate optimal LDCT screening strategies for SPLC that integrates
smoking cessation programs for LC survivors. We will extend a microsimulation model for risk-based LDCT
screening for SPLC that integrates smoking cessation programs (e.g., pharmacotherapy) for LC survivors. This
proposed extension study is within scope of the parent R37 because these aims are a logical extension of the
parent grant (i) by validating and refining the existing SPLC prediction model using more comprehensive data
and (ii) by incorporating the temporal changes of the key risk factors (e.g., smoking) for SPLC. We expect that
adding these aims will help improve the existing prediction model for SPLC and help understand the role of
smoking cessation on SPLC risk and LC mortality. By completing this extension study, we expect to provide a
set of optimal screening strategies for SPLC by evaluating the potential harms and benefits of screening under
various strategies combined with smoking cessation programs. These results will reduce clinician and patient
uncertainty about the potential role of screening and smoking cessation in LC survivors, and thus will likely
translate into increased implementation of this life-saving preventive measure."

of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could
be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan
builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research
environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD
and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven
computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety
disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on
multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group).
Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the
proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment
outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms
association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform
different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and
expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and
ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in
psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain

10741760,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mammalian heart has a poor ability to regenerate heart muscle following myocardial infarction and dead
cardiac muscle is replaced by scar tissue. Scar tissue is non-contractile, induces adverse cardiac remodeling
and leads to dilatation of cardiac chambers, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and development of heart failure.
Despite optimal use of cardiovascular drugs, adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction contributes to
40% of all new case of heart failure. There thus exists an immense need to identify new targets for attenuating
post infarct remodeling and development of heart failure. In this application, we identify GPNMB (Glycoprotein
Non-Metastatic Melanoma Protein B) as a novel target for attenuating post infarct cardiac remodeling. We
identified the protein using a systems genetics approach, in which a panel of inbred strains of mice were
studied for heart failure traits in response to isoproterenol treatment. We demonstrate that GPNMB expression
increases by an order of magnitude in infarcted murine hearts and regulates wound healing events in the heart
early following injury. We show that macrophages that are recruited to the infarcted heart are the primary
source of GPNMB expression. Using loss and gain of function approaches, we demonstrate that GPNMB
activates cardiac fibroblasts and induces profound cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In contrast, genetic deletion of
GPNMB leads to attenuation of post infarct cardiac remodeling and is associated with better preservation of
cardiac function. We also provide data that GPNMB plasma levels in humans is strongly associated with heart
failure strengthening a causal relationship between GPNMB and the development of post infarct heart failure.
Considering these observations, we hypothesize that GPNMB regulates (i) post infarct cardiac remodeling and
(ii) inhibition of GPNMB will attenuate post infarct cardiac remodeling. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary
team comprising expertise in cardiac physiology, genetics and extracellular matrix biology to interrogate the
role and mechanisms of GPNMB in regulating post infarct cardiac remodeling. In the first aim, we will examine
the role of GPNMB on cardiac remodeling with gain and loss of function approaches. In the second aim, we will
identify mechanisms of GPNMB activation and use physico-chemical studies to determine the receptor to
which GPNMB ligand binds and GPNMB domains critical for binding. In the third aim, we will use mouse and
human genetics approaches to model biological pathways influenced by GPNMB and interrogate common
downstream signaling pathways that mediate GPNMB effects on myocytes and non-myocytes. Finally, we will
determine whether pharmacological targeting of GPNMB can be therapeutic strategy for attenuating adverse
remodeling after cardiac injury."
10740891,"Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is the most common inherited recessive ataxia, for which there is no FDA-approved
therapy. FA's pathophysiological mechanism is caused by the reduction of just one mitochondrial protein, frataxin (FXN),
that functions in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 5 and 15 years and
worsen over time. Although sensory and balance deficits put FA patients in wheelchairs, nearly all FA patients die of
cardiomyopathy. Currently, there are no drug therapies that ameliorate FA cardiomyopathy and most with FA die of the
cardiomyopathy in their 30s.
 We identified redox deficiency in FA human fibroblasts, and used this to screen a library of 1600 drugs already
safely used in humans, to test for their ability to prevent cell death in FA. We identified dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a
prodrug precursor of monomethyl fumarate (MMF), as the most protective among all tested drugs. DMF (also known as
Tecfidera and Skilarence) is the FDA approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. In the most
physiological mouse model of FA (the FXNKD), we found that 1) DMF dose-dependently rescued FXN levels and the
mitochondrial Fe-S cluster enzymes aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase activity in the heart; 2) DMF significantly
rescued three critical cardiac deficits in mice that resemble human FA cardiac defects: a) left ventricular hypertrophy; b)
decreased stroke volume; and c) decreased cardiac output. Preliminary data support the claim that DMF is providing
mitochondrial->frataxin-> Fe-S cluster support via Nrf2-dependent mechanism.
 Additionally, we recently synthesized an alternative MMF prodrug called IMF, with improved pharmacokinetics
that may be even more potent than DMF. Therefore, we hypothesize that fumarates DMF/IMF represent a novel
therapeutic strategy that can potentially be repurposed for the lethal cardiomyopathy in FA. The aim of the current work
is to determine the effects of DMF/IMF on the function of most affected tissues in FA (heart and skeletal muscles), and to
determine the mechanism of protective action. DMF has already passed through FDA's safety, toxicology and DMPK
hurdles, and thus could enter clinical trials much more quickly than a new compound that must pass through extensive
safety and toxicology testing before it could be used in clinical trials. However, before attempting to use the drug in
humans with FA, completion of the 'pre-clinical package' for DMF/IMF and their role for cardiac/skeletal muscle
protection in FA are important, and can be addressed in the three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is designed to determine optimal
dosing of DMF & IMF that rescue cardiac and skeletal muscles deficits. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism
responsible for functional recovery in the FXNKD mouse. Aim 3 is designed to determine whether optimal dosing of
DMF/IMF extends the life span of mouse with cardiac-specific FXN KO (MCK-Cre). Cumulatively these aims will
generate pre-clinical data for the potential use of DMF and IMF for lethal cardiomyopathy in FA. Because DMF is
already approved for use in humans with safety/DMPK/toxicology and Phase I studies already completed, it has a greater
opportunity to be 'fast-tracked' for treatment of cardiac myopathy in FA."

 In the heart, the primary function of mitochondria is to meet the high energy demand of the beating
myocytes by providing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. However, mitochondria can quickly change into
death-promoting organelles. Not surprisingly, cells have developed multiple defense mechanisms against
aberrant mitochondria that can cause harm to the cell. The ability to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria and
prevent unnecessary death is particularly important in post-mitotic myocytes that cannot be easily replaced. It is
well established that dysfunctional mitochondria are rapidly sequestered by autophagosomes and subsequently
delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Recent studies have identified cells that can also eliminate mitochondria
via a Rab9-dependent alternative autophagy pathway or via a Rab5-dependent-early endosomal pathway.
Mitochondria can also be directly taken up by lysosomes. Clearly, multiple pathways of mitochondrial elimination
exist in cells to prevent their accumulation and ensure survival. However, these degradation pathways all
converge at the level of the lysosomes and it is not clear whether alternative mitochondrial quality control
pathways exists when lysosomal function is compromised. We have discovered that dysfunctional mitochondria
can also be secreted from cells when internal degradation pathways are overwhelmed or impaired. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that Rab7-/- and LAMP2-/- cells that have impaired lysosomal degradation are still
able to efficiently eliminate depolarized mitochondria. We also found increased levels of circulating extracellular
vesicles (EVs) containing mitochondria in plasma after a myocardial infarction, as well as in cardiac specific
Rab7- and LAMP2-deficient mice at baseline. Proteomics analysis of EVs combined with Western blot analysis
suggest that the mitochondria are in vesicles that originate from the endosomal pathway. In this proposal, we
will investigate the hypothesis that dysfunctional mitochondria are secreted from cells in EVs and that this
represent an important quality control pathway in the heart that can compensate when lysosomes are
overwhelmed or compromised. This hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will identify
the origin and fate of the extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria and determine the pathophysiological
conditions that induce their release from myocytes. Specific aim 2 will dissect the molecular mechanisms
regulating secretion of mitochondria in EVs. Overall, these studies will provide important new insights into a
novel alternative mechanism of mitochondrial elimination in the myocardium. The studies will also provide
insights into whether these EVs can potentially function as early diagnostic biomarkers of cardiac stress prior to
development of disease."

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is large DNA virus, which is the etiological agent of several
AIDS-related malignancies such as Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and aggressive forms of
multicentric Castleman’s disease. Lytic replication of KSHV is critical for both KSHV-induced tumorigenesis and
dissemination of the virus. Recent studies have shown that following replication in the oral epithelial cells, KSHV
can be transmitted into endothelial and B cells where the virus establishes latency resulting persistent infection
of the host. Infected oral epithelial cells also serve as the source of new viral particles shedding into the saliva,
which mediates the viral transmission in the population. Despite the medical and biological importance of oral
KSHV infection, it is still largely unknown what viral and host factors play a role in the regulation of lytic KSHV
infection of oral epithelial cells. KSHV is unique among human viruses that it encodes four viral interferon
regulatory factors that are homologous to cellular IRFs. These viral proteins have been shown to regulate many
different immune-related pathways and can enhance cell growth and cell survival. While many of these vIRF
functions are linked to the cytoplasmic functions of vIRFs, the nuclear role of vIRFs in gene regulation, especially
in oral epithelial cells, that may promote lytic KSHV infection is still poorly understood. To reveal the role of vIRFs
in viral and cellular gene regulation, we have identified the host target genes of each vIRF in primary human
gingival epithelial cells and revealed a highly specialized function for each vIRF. In addition, we performed a
protein complex purification of vIRF1 from KSHV-infected cells and discovered that vIRF1 can interact with
several host epigenetic factors involved in DNA binding, histone acetylation or histone methylation. Based on
our preliminary data, the goal of this proposal is (Aim 1) to identify the direct target genes of vIRFs and test their
role in lytic KSHV infection, and (Aim 2) to investigate the gene regulatory mechanisms mediated by vIRF1 and
its associated host epigenetic factors, which can be critical for facilitating lytic replication of KSHV. Since many
of the vIRF1-regulated host genes encode factors that are known to be de-regulated in other viral infections as
well, we envision that the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms and host gene targets of vIRF1 during KSHV
infection can provide novel targets for future development of new antiviral therapies."

Oncogene activation is modulated by normal subcellular compartments that execute specialized functions
related to hallmark cancer phenotypes. These organelles must adapt to oncogenic stress in order for tumors
to initiate and progress, but there is little to no systems-level understanding of how such adaptations occur and
what vulnerabilities might be created. The Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Cancer Organelles (SASCO)
Center at the University of Virginia will address this challenge by mechanistic modeling of organellar processes
that iterates with quantitative experiments in disease-relevant cell cultures and primary tumors. The working
SASCO Center hypothesis is that organelle-specific adaptation to oncogenic stress occurs through a few
critical bottlenecks, which become identifiable once the relevant signaling, metabolic, and transport pathways
have been properly integrated. The Center brings together 14 investigators with primary and collaborative
track records in cancer biology, systems biology, genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, and clinical
practice. Three Research Projects and one Shared Research Core will pursue a common research strategy,
which leverages mechanistic models to test competing alternative hypotheses about how organelles adapt to
stresses from proximal oncogenes that drive specific types of cancer. The Projects are organized
hierarchically as organelle stresses downstream of proliferation-inducing oncogenes. Project 1 will examine
the chromosome passenger complex and its regulated phase separation during metaphase as an organelle
that senses and repairs spindle defects to suppress breast cancer aneuploidy driven by mitotic transcription
factors. Project 2 will evaluate the metabolic consequences of chronic mitochondrial fragmentation caused by
mutant KRAS in primary colorectal cancers and secondary liver metastases. Project 3 will investigate localized
signal-transduction rebalancing as a mechanism for alleviating plasma-membrane stress caused by EGFR
amplification in glioblastoma. All Research Projects will rely on the High-Content Imaging & Analysis Core to
obtain iterative multichannel immunofluorescence data with organelle-level resolution and quantification. The
SASCO Outreach Core amplifies ongoing programs at the University of Virginia to provide summer research
experiences for undergraduates and faculty scholars from historically underrepresented backgrounds as well
as introductory systems biology modeling materials for clinicians across the Commonwealth of Virginia. The

11074874,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Oncogene activation is modulated by normal subcellular compartments that execute specialized functions
related to hallmark cancer phenotypes. These organelles must adapt to oncogenic stress in order for tumors
to initiate and progress, but there is little to no systems-level understanding of how such adaptations occur and
what vulnerabilities might be created. The Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Cancer Organelles (SASCO)
Center at the University of Virginia will address this challenge by mechanistic modeling of organellar processes
that iterates with quantitative experiments in disease-relevant cell cultures and primary tumors. The working
SASCO Center hypothesis is that organelle-specific adaptation to oncogenic stress occurs through a few
critical bottlenecks, which become identifiable once the relevant signaling, metabolic, and transport pathways
have been properly integrated. The Center brings together 14 investigators with primary and collaborative
track records in cancer biology, systems biology, genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, and clinical
practice. Three Research Projects and one Shared Research Core will pursue a common research strategy,
which leverages mechanistic models to test competing alternative hypotheses about how organelles adapt to
stresses from proximal oncogenes that drive specific types of cancer. The Projects are organized
hierarchically as organelle stresses downstream of proliferation-inducing oncogenes. Project 1 will examine
the chromosome passenger complex and its regulated phase separation during metaphase as an organelle
that senses and repairs spindle defects to suppress breast cancer aneuploidy driven by mitotic transcription
factors. Project 2 will evaluate the metabolic consequences of chronic mitochondrial fragmentation caused by
mutant KRAS in primary colorectal cancers and secondary liver metastases. Project 3 will investigate localized
signal-transduction rebalancing as a mechanism for alleviating plasma-membrane stress caused by EGFR
amplification in glioblastoma. All Research Projects will rely on the High-Content Imaging & Analysis Core to
obtain iterative multichannel immunofluorescence data with organelle-level resolution and quantification. The
SASCO Outreach Core amplifies ongoing programs at the University of Virginia to provide summer research
experiences for undergraduates and faculty scholars from historically underrepresented backgrounds as well
as introductory systems biology modeling materials for clinicians across the Commonwealth of Virginia. The
SASCO Center will thus create a national headquarters for subcellular cancer systems biology within the
broader Cancer Systems Biology Consortium."
10741762,"The Johns Hopkins University-Uganda Clinical Trial Unit (JHU-CTU) renewal application aims to continue to
support cutting edge HIV related research to expand scientific knowledge; and to identify innovative HIV
prevention and treatment interventions that will help end the global HIV pandemic. The JHU-CTU has
successfully participated as an NIH supported CTU, conducting HIV prevention and treatment clinical trials with
two clinical research sites (CRSs) focused on PMTCT and high-risk women in Uganda over the past 25 years.
This application builds on the highly successful JHU-CTU Network research on Prevention of Mother to Child
Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, Pediatric HIV treatment, and HIV Prevention among high risk HIV negative
women. We propose to add two new Network affiliation (HIV Vaccines and Adult Therapeutics) and add three
new CRSs to access diverse adult HIV-infected and most-at-risk adult populations in Kampala and Rakai
Districts. These adult-focused CRSs cover some of the highest-HIV prevalence areas in Uganda with distinct
urban, peri-urban, and rural settings, and will greatly enhance the JHU-Uganda CTU’s capacity to recruit diverse
HIV-infected and at-risk populations for HIV treatment and prevention trials.
 The JHU-CTU plans to associate with the four DAIDS funded HIV Clinical Trial networks, which are
addressing Adult HIV Therapeutics and Related Co-infections; Maternal Adolescent and Pediatric Therapeutics;
HIV Prevention; and HIV Vaccines; and to contribute strongly to support their respective HIV Leadership
Research Agendas. The proposed CRSs have access to distinct and diverse populations of HIV infected or at
risk groups. These populations, including newly diagnosed HIV infected adults, as well as those on long term
treatment, pregnant and breastfeeding HIV infected mothers and their HIV exposed infants; HIV infected
adolescents (primarily long-term survivors from perinatal HIV infection); at risk adolescents/adults based on
risky sex (e.g. sex workers, MSM); other at risk groups including fisher folk. Each of the Uganda CRSs have
outstanding records of conducting HIV research. Research Aims of the JHU-Uganda CTU application include:
 • Assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics of new antiretroviral and immune interventions and novel
 models of delivery for both treatment and prevention
 • Participating in multifaceted PrEP trials among high risk populations using new drugs/ delivery systems
 • Evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of new HIV, TB, HBV vaccines, as well as vaccines for other
 co-infections seen among both HIV exposed and HIV infected populated populations
 • Providing mentoring and training for rising investigators and clinical research staff in clinical trials
The JHU-CTU/CRS investigators will continue their strong scientific contributions to the cutting-edge research
agendas of the HIV leadership groups by actively contributing to the research agendas of the Network Leadership
Scientific Committees and helping lead study protocols and other network related studies."

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells resulting in over 12,000 U.S. deaths each year. Genetic alterations
in myeloma include trisomy of most odd-numbered chromosomes, translocations that result in ectopic expression
of oncogenes as well as structural variants and mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These
distinct genetic alterations manifest as unique molecular subtypes. Significant improvements in outcomes have
been made using therapies including proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide-analogs collectively known as
immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), and immunotherapies. Unfortunately, most patients still develop
disease that is refractory to treatment and succumb to myeloma. These frontline therapies are used regardless
of myeloma subtype and whether they are equally effective in all myelomas is not fully understood. This is
underscored by our recent study identifying Immunoglobulin Light Chain Lambda (IGL) translocations as
predictive of poor IMiD responses. IMiDs mediate the degradation of the lymphocyte transcription factors
IKAROS and AIOLOS. Interestingly, the IGL enhancer was bound by some of the highest levels of IKAROS in
the myeloma epigenome. This suggests that location and levels of IKAROS and AIOLOS activity in the genome
dictate IMiD responses. To test the hypothesis that the genomic elements bound by IKAROS and AIOLOS
determine IMiD response and that these regions vary between myeloma genetic subtypes the following aims are
proposed. 1) IKAROS and AIOLOS genomic binding sites will be determined and compared between IMiD-
sensitive and -resistant myeloma cells to see if these factors localize to distinct regions of the genome in IMiD-
resistant myeloma. In conjunction, the epigenetic program of IKAROS- and AIOLOS-bound regions will be
characterized under baseline and IMiD-treated conditions to identify how IKAROS and AIOLOS depletion affects
these elements as well as the resultant impact on gene expression. 2) IKAROS and AIOLOS will each be
inhibited using CRISPR interference and the resultant phenotypic and molecular impact will be assessed to
determine the contribution of each factor to IMiD responses. 3) IKAROS- and AIOLOS-bound genomic elements
will be systematically disrupted to test the function of these regulatory elements in mediating IMiD resistance.
 The long-term goals of the candidate are to run an independent research program investigating the etiology
of cancer and translate findings into better therapeutic targeting and patient outcomes. The above aims will
provide a framework for establishing an independent research program. The above aims will also apply
innovative new approaches to discover the mechanism by which IMiDs exert their therapeutic effects and why
some myelomas become IMiD resistant, a major cause of multiple myeloma mortality."
10745686,"Project Summary/Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a deadly interstitial lung disease (ILD) with treatment
options limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate
disease. A growing literature now implicates lung epithelial dysfunction as playing a role in the events
that lead to downstream fibroblast activation, culminating in relentless fibrosis. These studies,
together with the observation that lung epithelial cells in all forms of IPF display shortened telomeres,
suggests that lung epithelial dysfunction may initiate IPF, and accelerated aging phenotypes or
telomerase pathway abnormalities likely contribute to this pathogenesis. However, without access to
patient-specific human epithelial-mesenchymal model systems, there are limited options for testing
hypotheses of how epithelial changes induced by gene polymorphisms or telomerase perturbations
might mechanistically contribute to IPF. Here we propose to develop a human organoid-based in vitro
model system for the study of IPF. We have established a biorepository of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) generated from individuals with sporadic or familial pulmonary fibrosis. In aim 1 we
apply this repository by directing the in vitro differentiation of banked IPF iPSCs carrying telomerase
mutations (vs normal iPSCs) into various airway and alveolar lung epithelial cells for the purpose of
generating a reductionist, epithelial-only 3D culture model of the intrinsic epithelial dysfunction that
we posit may initiate pulmonary fibrosis. In aim 2 we augment the complexity of this model by
introducing human organoids composed of iPSC-derived lung epithelia juxtaposed with human
mesenchymal lineages in order to model the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions hypothesized to
perpetuate IPF. Finally, in aim 3 we test the hypothesis that different telomerase pathway mutations
result in shared lung epithelial perturbations, including short telomeres and p53 activation, that then
leads to downstream mesenchymal activation."

BRAIN Initiative-funded, large-scale approaches to classify neurons based on transcriptomic, morphological and
electrical properties have unveiled dozens of unique cell classes in the mouse brain. However, whether they
represent functionally diverse populations of relevance to animal perception and behavior remains an open
question. Dissecting their individual roles requires the integration of targeted recording techniques and
optogenetic manipulation approaches, which operate at the physiologically relevant spatiotemporal scales (i.e.
cellular resolution and millisecond timescales).
 Here, we propose to use high-speed (0.4-1 kHz), genetically encoded fluorescence voltage imaging to
understand the role of distinct interneuronal populations in attentional modulation of visual processing during
visually guided behavior. First, we will establish the optical instrumentation for high-speed, dual channel voltage
imaging with non-overlapping structured illumination. We will further validate the use of our second-generation,
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-opsin indicators Ace-mNeon2 and VARNAM2 and their reverse
response polarity variants pAce and pAceR, for concurrent voltage recordings from pairs of interneuronal
ensembles and pyramidal neurons in awake, running mice. Thereafter, using simultaneous triple-population
voltage imaging, we will assess the effects of attention on the firing rates of the three cell classes during visually
guided behavior and compute the spatiotemporal correlations in the activation patterns of neighboring neurons.
Separately, we will measure the visual tuning properties of the same neurons during presentations of drifting
grating stimuli. We will further draw a correlation between neuronal attention modulation index and feature
selectivity to test the applicability of the feature similarity gain model. Lastly, to establish causal roles in the
attentional modulation of visual responses, we will optogenetically manipulate the activity of select interneurons
in a spatially precise manner, while recording the voltage responses in neighboring pyramidal cells when mice
are engaged in the behavioral task.
 Our proposed work will (1) elucidate the role of distinct interneuron-types in visual attention and enable
functional cross-comparisons within the same animals and at increased spatiotemporal resolution; (2) uncover
synergistic and antagonistic relationships between neighboring pyramidal neuron-interneuron pairs for neurons
that are positively versus negatively modulated by attention; (3) test the applicability of the feature similarity gain
model in rodents and (4) establish causal roles for distinct interneuronal populations in attentional modulation of
visual processing.
 Together, our work will establish simultaneous, multipopulation voltage imaging as the preferred modality
to unravel the real-time functional differences between neuron-types in perception and behavior."

The Neuroproteomics Core of The Scripps Research Institute Alcohol Research Center (TSRI-ARC) will provide
mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical collaborations to meet the specific needs of the TSRI-ARC and Center-
at-Large. Given the breadth of work to be conducted in this translational research center, it is understandable
that not all personnel will have expertise in specialized areas of analytical chemistry. The first goal of the
Neuroproteomics Core is to provide access to proteomic methods, such as protein expression analysis,
phosphoproteomics, protein interactions, and biorthogonal chemistry, for the discovery of molecular mechanisms
in animal models of alcohol drinking and dependence to TSRI-ARC investigators. Personalized consultation with
investigators on issues related to experimental design, sample collection, sample handling, and data
interpretation will be provided. The second goal of the Core is to advance methods to perform single-neuron
proteomic measurements in combination with electrophysiology measurements to study alcohol use disorder
(AUD). In all these experiments, Core personnel will work closely with TSRI-ARC investigators to solve technical
problems and assess and analyze the data."
10757670,"Animal Models Core Abstract
The goals of the Animal Models Core are to ensure that standardized behavioral and biochemical operating
procedures are used across laboratories, to supply animals dependent on alcohol using chronic intermittent
ethanol vapor exposure (CIE model), and to provide blood alcohol level (BAL) determinations to The Scripps
Research Institute Alcohol Research Center (TSRI-ARC) investigators. In this renewal we are adding to our
mouse vapor chamber capacity to meet the increased needs of the research components. In addition, our gas
chromatograph system has been optimized as well as the means to request this service and provide BAL data
back to requestors in a timely and efficient manner. Centralization of these services prevents unnecessary
duplication of resources and effort, provides substantial time- and cost-savings for research components, and
promotes standardized quality control and increased consistency across projects. In order to continue the
important model development and optimization goals of the Animal Models Core, we plan to extend and
strengthen the phenotypic characterization of withdrawal and protracted abstinence in the mouse CIE model and
to examine a strategy for removing the need for pyrazole + ethanol injections prior to vapor exposure. The Animal
Models Core will promote integrative, efficient, and high-quality research that is the foundation of the ARC
research goals and mission."
10757673,"Abstract
Protracted withdrawal is characterized by negative emotional symptoms and their alleviation is a driving force
for continued alcohol consumption. Our TSRI-ARC focuses on identifying the enduring neuroadaptations in the
brain stress systems that drive relapse. In rats with ethanol dependence, an overactivation of the central nucleus
of the amygdala (CeA) is driven by recruitment of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and CRF1 receptors
(CRF1). Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and its receptor (NOP) exert anti-stress effects by
counteracting the function of endogenous CRF in CeA. The infralimbic (IL) subdivision of the mPFC exerts “top-
down” control over the amygdala to regulate emotional aspects of goal-directed behaviors. Our main hypothesis
is that dysfunction of mPFC contributes to the negative affect that drives withdrawal-induced drinking. We predict
that IL pyramidal neurons that project to CeA (ILàCeA) may normally inhibit ethanol seeking and drinking under
stress, a function that is compromised (decreased) in AUD, rendering subjects vulnerable to stress-induced
negative urgency for ethanol. Preliminary chemogenetic data from Zorrilla’s component point to a causal role of
rat ILàCeA inhibition in negative affect. Moreover, Martin-Fardon’s component showed that intra-IL CRF1 or
hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) antagonist infusion reduced stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking in rats.
These peptides are highly expressed in IL, but their interplay is understudied. The Neurophysiology Project
(Lead: Roberto; Co-Lead: Bajo) will elucidate the mechanisms and neurotransmitters that disrupt IL functions
and identify the ILàCeA role in these behavioral phenotypes. We will test the hypothesis that ethanol
dependence [induced by chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)] and abstinence produce an imbalance between brain
stress (e.g., CRF) and anti-stress (e.g., N/OFQ) systems within the ILàCeA circuitry. Here we show that 1) CRF
decreases spontaneous GABA release but increases glutamate release onto layer V IL pyramidal neurons of
naïve male rats, 2) the CRF-associated reduction of GABA release onto ILàCeA neurons is stronger than onto
other IL neurons. Our preliminary data support that the ILàCeA neurons represent a subset of neurons with
unique electrophysiological properties and responsiveness to dependence/withdrawal that account for a
decrease in ILàCeA connectivity. Moreover, CRF-induced facilitation of glutamate release and firing are
opposed by N/OFQ in the IL. Thus, this proposal will a) investigate the mechanisms mediating N/OFQ and CRF
modulation of overall IL function (Specific Aim 1) and b) will unveil the unique electrophysiological properties of
IL pyramidal neurons that project to CeA and their role in negative behavioral symptomatology of ethanol
withdrawal (Specific Aim 2). This project will use ex vivo electrophysiology and proteomics of circuit-defined
neurons, protein assays, in situ hybridization, neuronal tracing, chemogenetics, and behavioral testing. These
techniques will involve the Animal Models and Neuroproteomics Cores, and collaborations with the Zorrilla,
Martin-Fardon, Contet, and George Components.

10757678,"SUMMARY
The overarching working model of The Scripps Research Institute Alcohol Research Center (TSRI-ARC) is that
the infralimbic subdivision of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) represents a critical hub for the dysregulation
of brain network activity by chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, driven in part by inputs from the
hypothalamus and impairing top-down control over the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Within this
framework, the Molecular Component, led by Drs. Contet and Dunning, will test the hypothesis that reduced
abundance of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) in mPFC astrocytes contributes to behavioral
phenotypes of alcohol dependence in mice by maintaining a local hyperglutamatergic tone that elevates the
inhibitory input of local interneurons onto pyramidal neurons projecting to the CeA. This hypothesis is supported
by results generated during the previous funding period, which revealed a long-lasting impact of CIE-induced
excessive alcohol drinking on the abundance of astrocytic markers, with GRM3 reaching proteome-wide
significance, in both prelimbic and infralimbic mPFC samples. GRM3 is strongly enriched in astrocytes where it
controls glutamate uptake, but it can also regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in neurons. Specific Aim 1
of this project will thus be to determine whether the GRM3 abundance reduction detected in bulk proteomes
stems from a reduction in astrocytes vs. neurons. To do this, we will leverage state-of-the-art quantitative mass
spectrometry from metabolically labeled brain samples to tease apart protein abundance changes in different
cell types. We anticipate that CIE-induced mPFC GRM3 deficiency will be specific to astrocytes and will be
associated with reduced abundance of glutamate transporters. We will also probe a potential role of CRF1
receptor signaling in this effect. We will then test the hypotheses that reduced GRM3 abundance is both
necessary (Specific Aim 2) and sufficient (Specific Aim 3) to produce the behavioral phenotypes of CIE
withdrawal in mice with a history of chronic excessive alcohol drinking, using gene expression manipulations
targeted to mPFC astrocytes. Analyzing the consequences of GRM3 overexpression and knockdown on cell
type-specific proteomes, extracellular glutamate levels, and synaptic transmission will provide mechanistic
insights into how these behavioral outcomes might be generated. Furthermore, Specific Aim 2 will include a
translational approach to rescue GRM3 signaling via inhibition of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII).
Altogether, this project is anticipated to establish the relevance of astrocytic GRM3 as an important regulator of
glutamate homeostasis in the mPFC that can be targeted to reduce excessive alcohol drinking. It will benefit
from the expertise and resources provided by the Neuroproteomics and Animal Models Cores and will interact
both conceptually and experimentally with the four other TSRI-ARC Research Components."
10757683,"Relapse vulnerability is a challenge for the successful treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), making relapse
prevention a central focus of treatment and medication development efforts. Stress is a major factor that
contributes to the chronic relapsing and compulsive nature of drug addiction. The hypocretin (Hcrt; orexin)
system regulates physiological processes including feeding, energy metabolism, arousal, and stress, and is
recruited by alcohol. Hypocretin neurons are only located in the hypothalamus (HYP) that includes the lateral
HYP (LH), dorsomedial HYP (DMH), and perifornical area (PFA) and project to major components of
neurocircuitry that mediates drug seeking including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Chronic drug use
dysregulates stress responses that are mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in both the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and extrahypothalamic brain stress areas outside the HPA axis (e.g.,
central nucleus of the amygdala [CeA] and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST]). An Hcrt/CRF interaction
exists that could participate in chronic relapsing and negative affective states that characterize drug addiction.
Dynorphin (Dyn) promotes depressive-like behavior and mediates the aversive effects of stress via k opioid
receptors (KORs) signaling. Even though Hcrt and Dyn are co-localized and co-released, in the ventral tegmental
area (VTA) and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), they play opposing roles in the mediation of
drug-directed behavior. The Martin-Fardon component will test whether Hcrt/CRF and Hcrt/Dyn interaction in the
infralimbic cortex (IL) -- a subregion of the mPFC that exerts inhibitory control over alcohol seeking and shows
long-term deficits in rats following a history of alcohol dependence -- changes following dependence and whether
these systems are pivotal in stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior in male and female rats
at late (2 weeks) abstinence. This will be achieved by (1) exploring whether the Hcrt/CRF and Hcrt/Dyn
interactions in the IL mediate stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior in alcohol-dependent
animals during abstinence; (2) establishing whether the IL Hcrt-r/CRF1/KOR signaling in the IL is upregulated
due to alcohol-dependence during abstinence; and (3) confirming the importance of the HYP(Hcrt)®IL circuit
during stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior using an inhibitory Designer Receptor
Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs construct selective for Orx cells in Orx-Cre rats. This project will provide
insights into the involvement of the IL Hcrt-r/CRF1/KOR signaling during pathological (alcohol-seeking) behavior
and may identify novel targets for alcohol craving and relapse prevention."
10745953,"The research described in this proposal will test the hypothesis that the secretion of let-7b—a 22-nucleotide
micro-RNA (miRNA)—by human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) in extracellular vesicles increases the
antibiotic sensitivity of and reduces biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is thereby an important
mechanism of host-pathogen interactions in the lungs. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that infects
the lungs of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and
pneumonia. P. aeruginosa contributes to 5–10% of the acute-exacerbation events that can occur with COPD,
which afflicts 24 million Americans and is the 3rd-leading cause of death in the U.S. Let-7b, like all miRNAs,
suppresses gene expression, is highly conserved across species, and regulates the innate host immune
responses to pathogens. In preliminary studies, this research team made the unique observations that: (1)
extracellular vesicles secreted by primary HBEC deliver let-7b into P. aeruginosa; and (2) that let-7b increases
the ability of front-line antibiotics to kill P. aeruginosa and reduce biofilm formation by targeting genes coding
for an RND efflux pump, genes essential for biofilm formation, and genes coding for β-lactamases. The team
also made the novel observation that let-7b is dramatically reduced in extracellular vesicles isolated from the
bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of CF patients, compared to BALF from healthy subjects, leading them to
conclude that let-7b secretion in extracellular vesicles is defective in CF. Aside from the clinical implications,
these preliminary data are exciting because they are the first direct demonstration that a eukaryotic miRNA can
regulate prokaryotic function. Building on these findings, the team propose three specific aims: (1) Test the
hypothesis that let-7b increases P. aeruginosa sensitivity to fluoroquinolone antibiotics by reducing the RND
efflux pump, MexGHI-OpmD; (2) Test the hypothesis that let-7b inhibits the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms
by targeting genes essential for biofilm formation; and (3) Test the hypothesis that let-7b increases P.
aeruginosa sensitivity to β-lactam antibiotics by targeting β-lactamases. Work in this project will utilize: (a)
RNA-seq and mass spectrometry to identify genes and proteins downregulated by let-7b in P. aeruginosa; (b)
GRIL-seq to directly identify let-7b mRNA targets in P. aeruginosa; and (c) a co-culture model developed by
the team to study P. aeruginosa biofilms growing on HBEC. Combined, this work will elucidate the
mechanisms whereby let-7b, which is anti-inflammatory, enhances the ability of antibiotics to kill P. aeruginosa
and reduce biofilm formation. Since several members of the let-7 family are currently in clinical trials, and
because chronic lung infections of P. aeruginosa in COPD and CF are associated with a hyper-inflammatory
state, the long-term goal of this work is to develop an approach utilizing let-7b in combination with antibiotics to
reduce P. aeruginosa lung infections—and the accompanying hyper-inflammatory state—in patients with CF
and COPD."

10749890,"A major research challenge for neurobiology is to understand the neural mechanisms that give rise to an
extreme diversity of parallel visual pathways and ultimately the contributions that these pathways make to our
perception of motion, form and color. For motion perception the cell types, circuits and synaptic mechanisms
that mediate selectivity to the direction of moving stimuli have been intensively studied in the non-primate
mammal for decades and over a dozen distinct direction selective pathways are recognized in the mouse
retina together with growing evidence for similarly diverse underlying neural mechanisms. The great complexity
of the visual pathways found in the mouse is mirrored in the primate, yet surprisingly the abundant direction
selective ganglion cells have not been previously identified. The broad long-term objective of this new research
program is to elucidate for the first time the cell types, circuits, synaptic organization and underlying cellular
mechanisms for direction selectivity in the macaque monkey retina, as an ideal model for human visual
processing centered around the fovea. Our proposed research plan arises from a series of discoveries that
opens a door to the first detailed study of both the visual physiology and synaptic organization of direction
selective circuitry in the macaque retina. In preliminary studies we have identified the primate ON-OFF
direction selective ganglion cell as the recursive bistratified type and have developed new methods that permit
systematic targeting of this cell type for analysis. The synaptic physiology and directional tuning of this
ganglion cell type are the focus of Aim 1 where we test the hypothesis that directional selectivity in the primate
is radially aligned with respect to the fovea. Second, we have developed reliable methods for targeting the
starburst amacrine cell type, the key retinal interneuron in the direction selective circuit, for both physiological
analysis and connectomic circuit reconstruction for the first time. Preliminary data reveal novel features of
starburst receptive field structure, directional tuning and connectivity providing the focus for Aim 2 where we
test new hypotheses for the cellular origins of direction selectivity and its synaptic transfer to ganglion cells.
Finally, we have discovered direction selectivity in the poly-axonal spiking A1 amacrine cell type and evidence
for a functional link to ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells. The focus of Aim 3 therefore is to test the
hypotheses that the A1 cells unique axonal component provides synaptic input to both starburst and ON-OFF
direction selective ganglion cells, and determine the role of the A1 cells unique dendro-axonal structure in
direction selectivity. In sum the broad aim is to characterize the directional tuning properties of these three cell
types, and to use connectomics for the first time to determine the underlying synaptic interactions that create
direction selectivity in the primate retina. Outcomes will thus have a specific impact on understanding of
mechanisms motion processing in human vision and more broadly on growing applications of the primate
model for the development of tools and methods for vision restoration."

The goal of this project is to understand how populations of the important disease vector Aedes aegypti are
responding to rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed work is designed to 1) test in the field
whether host-seeking females in the rapidly growing cities of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso and Kumasi, Ghana
show greater attraction to human hosts than host-seeking females in nearby rural areas and 2) to identify the
specific genes driving this behavioral shift. The proposed work builds on my recently published finding that
laboratory colonies of Ae. aegypti established from dense urban areas were more attracted to human hosts
than laboratory colonies established from nearby rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa; these behavioral shifts
were associated with genetic differences in a few key chromosomal regions. Modeling based on United
Nations projections of urban growth suggested that these effects will increase dramatically in the next 30
years. I will use paired mosquito traps baited with human and non-human animal odors to test preference for
human hosts across urban-rural gradients in Ouagadougou and Kumasi, building on productive and pre-
existing collaborations. In a parallel analysis using a molecular barcoding approach, I will separate blood-fed
individuals into sets that chose human or non-human animal hosts, and determine whether differences in host
preference translate into differences in rates of feeding on human hosts. Using low-coverage whole genome
sequencing of mosquitoes from both of these collections, I will simultaneously identify genomic shifts across
this urban-rural gradient and identify specific genes involved in driving individual differences in host preference.
This work will clarify the causes and evolutionary mechanisms underlying rapid changes in vector populations,
and provide key tools for monitoring and preventing the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne disease in
high-risk regions."
11014240,"Project Summary/Abstract
Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs) are a set of complex, poorly understood painful conditions that
profoundly impact the quality of life of many children and adults in the US. Patients presenting with TMJDs often
respond well to conservative therapy, but some patients endure multiple surgical procedures without relief.
Indeed, the profound lack of mechanistic knowledge underpinning TMJDs has hindered the development of
evidence-based therapy. As a result, there is a critical need to utilize the most recent technological advances in
molecular biology towards developing novel therapeutic targets to improve care. In this project, we propose to
utilize single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to identify and classify the cell populations and gene expression
in TMJ synovial fluid. Our central hypothesis is that synovial fluid from symptomatic TMJD patients contains a
unique cell population that is directly correlated to TMJ pain. In the UH2 phase of this project, we will develop
the protocols for obtaining high quality TMJ synovial fluid and blood from healthy and symptomatic TMJD
patients. In the UH3 phase of this project, we will perform single cell RNA sequencing and analysis on TMJ
synovial fluid and blood from both healthy and symptomatic TMJD patients. We hypothesize that synovial fluid
from symptomatic TMJD patients contains a unique cell population that can be identified by single cell RNA
sequencing, is correlated with pain but not joint derangement, is present in blood from TMJD patients

will provide mechanistic data at the single cell level regarding the initiation and resolution of TMJD."
10932101,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer's Disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are irreversible conditions affecting
over 6 million people in the United States. While the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD is complex, modifiable
cardiovascular risk factors contribute to its pathogenesis. These risk factors are unequally distributed, with higher
prevalence among socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial and ethnic minority groups, and the problem is
compounded by lower rates of cognitive screening and diagnosis across these groups – as documented in Black,
Latino, Asian, and Native American populations. While referral to qualified memory specialists (geriatricians
and/or neurologists) for evaluation and management is considered gold standard, in practice most diagnosis and
management of AD/ADRD occurs in non-specialty (primary care) settings, due to shortage of specialists. Novel
cognitive screening programs that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to close this gap
considerably. In this context, we propose a multicomponent stakeholder- and technology-based framework to
improve early detection of MCI and AD/ADRD, to elevate the quality of cognitive screening and secondary
prevention within primary care, with a focus on practices that treat patients from socioeconomically and racially
diverse backgrounds. We will design and implement an embedded Pragmatic Clinical Trial (ePCT) that involves
engaging patients, families and PCPs to refine existing practices on how PCPs should present information on
cognitive screening, MCI and AD/ADRD diagnosis, and their linkage with cardiovascular disease. We will
leverage an EHR-based clinical decision support tool based on retrospectively validated artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) methods for identifying MCI and AD/ADRD. Primary outcome for the ePCT will be
the rate of cognitive screening, and secondary outcomes will include diagnosis of dementia, and secondary
cardiovascular preventive measures. This ePCT effort will focus on the two NYU Langone Health Brooklyn
ambulatory care centers, which include over 70 PCPs and over 10,000 patients age ≥65 years. (With 62% self-
identified as non-white). Our Specific Aims are to (Aim 1) Conduct a pilot ePCT to optimize and evaluate the
acceptability, usability and adoption of implementing an existing AI/ML tool and PCP decision support in a
predominantly racial and ethnic underrepresented minority cohort. (Aim 2) Validate and monitor the ePCT
primary outcome of cognitive screening, and secondary outcomes of diagnosis of MCI, AD/ADRD, and
cardiovascular disease prevention outcomes. (Aim 3) Perform a sub-analysis of patient outcomes across
different racial/ethnic subgroups for differences in uptake of screening, diagnosis, secondary cardiovascular
preventative interventions. This pilot ePCT will pave the way for larger scale pragmatic trials that will address an
unmet and urgent need in cognitive health management of elderly population, particularly those most vulnerable
to the disease."

The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network has significantly
advanced efforts to stem the global HIV epidemic among pregnant women, infants, children and adolescents
through the conduct of high-quality clinical trials. The IMPAACT vision and overall goal is to end the worldwide
HIV epidemic among these vulnerable populations. To achieve this goal, IMPAACT will evaluate novel and
durable treatments for both HIV and TB, to establish strategies for antiretroviral treatment (ART)-free
remission, and to address the complications, co-morbidities, and co-infections affecting these HIV-infected and
at-risk populations of interest. The results of our studies have contributed to licensure or labeling changes for
new antiretrovirals/formulations for use in HIV-infected pregnant women, infants and children and influenced
international and US guidelines for clinical care in these vulnerable populations. In addition to generating
concrete evidence in these areas, IMPAACT's work has served to build much needed research and laboratory
capacity in resource-limited settings, where burden of the HIV epidemic remains the greatest. The IMPAACT
Laboratory Center has been integral to the Network's success in defining the standards of care for HIV infected
pregnant women, children and adolescents. Many of the mechanistic underpinnings that explain the success of
IMPAACT clinical trials are managed and discovered by IMPAACT Laboratory Center investigators. In this
competitive renewal of the IMPAACT Laboratory Center, we propose a work closely the Operations Center and
the Statistical and Data Management Center to develop, implement and evaluate the laboratory activities
necessary to accomplish IMPAACT's research agenda. Further, the Laboratory Center will ensure that there
are relevant state-of-the-art expertise and technologies and to oversee all laboratory operations confirming that
all laboratory results are consistent, reproducible and can support study reconstruction."
10745309,"The key challenge addressed in this proposal is to develop a means to harness the power of molecular biology to define therapeutic targets for brain disease. This treatment-oriented approach combines the urgency of a practicing neurologist with the knowledge and technology modern science brings to neuroscience. From the basic science perspective, understanding the fundamental root mechanism of disease is an uncompromising goal. From the neurologist's perspective, the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good, leading to five basic points: · Success to date in the treatment of brain disease offers a key lesson in focus. Treatments target accessible molecules, and this will dictate how we focus big data analysis. · Human neurologic disease is complicated. The best model system for understanding neurologic disorders is the human; studies of human brain material must be integral to developing new treatments. · Regardless of the cause of brain disease—and current neuroscience is appropriately  focused on tracing “genetic” (DNA) etiologies—the manifestations of such defects are  mediated by the stoichiometry, distribution and variability of cell-specific RNA regulation and  its consequent effects on proteins within affected cells. · Different cell types contribute to different brain disorders, but the difference between individual cells of any one type is unknown. The differences between them are manifest at the level of RNA, not DNA. · The quantity, quality (isoforms) and distribution of targets (e.g., receptors) are enormous.  The unique spectrum of diversity of an individual cell type—neurons, astrocytes or microglial cells—is unknown, more so when comparing diseased and normal brain. Using a variety of new strategies, we will study RNA regulation in individual cell types. · Bridging these points together requires new methods and computational approaches. · The net result of contrasting RNA regulation in individual human cell types in health and disease will uncover otherwise hidden cell type-specific targets for therapeutics."
10879123,"Project summary
Interactions between human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and their environment are a main factor in the
function of these cells. Although the importance of cell-material interactions is well established, it has been difﬁ-
cult to characterize this complex interplay, especially in vivo. During in vivo experiments, a stem cell treatment's
efﬁcacy can be assessed, but the underlying cellular processes and change in the surrounding microenvironment
that leads to these outcomes remain a black box. Positive outcomes may result from these experiments even
if there is loss of function or integrity in the tissue due to failed cell-material interactions, making aspects of the
stem cell treatment ineffective and potentially unnecessary. Since real-time measurement of these interactions
has not been realized in vivo, in vitro models provide an alternative approach to measuring cell-material inter-
actions in both 2D and 3D culture. The use of scaffolds to mimic aspects of native tissue provide controlled
environments where cell-material interactions can be quantitatively characterized. These scaffolds are used for
3D cell encapsulation and are designed to be remodeled by cells. This creates a feedback loop where the cell
remodels the pericellular region and responds to the dynamically changing cues in the environment. Real-time
characterization of these dynamic cell-material interactions continues to be a challenge. We propose to char-
acterize dynamic cell-material interactions by measuring real-time hMSC-mediated scaffold remodeling using
microrheological characterization and the resulting cellular processes using cell staining and inhibition. We will
use an hMSC-laden synthetic hydrogel scaffold that mimics aspects of native microenvironments to present cues
to cells. To characterize hMSC function, we will use techniques including cell staining and pharmacological inhibi-
tion of molecules for cellular contractility and matrix adhesion. Our unique approach will characterize the scaffold
microenvironment in real-time during cell-material interactions. We will use multiple particle tracking microrhe-
ology (MPT) to measure hMSC-mediated scaffold remodeling and degradation. This technique quantiﬁes the
spatio-temporal evolution of the rheology in the pericellular region, which is part of the feedback loop that deﬁnes
cell-material interactions. Together, these measurements will provide a relationship between cellular function and
cell-engineered pericellular rheology as the complexity of the scaffold microenvironment is increased. The pro-
posed research program will focus on characterizing cell-material interactions during speciﬁc critical processes
that are not fully understood. The processes we will study are (1) cellular adhesion, (2) hMSC motility in re-
sponse to scaffold viscoelasticity and (3) hMSC-material interactions when signaling molecules are presented in
the environment. The proposed work will support the overarching goal of understanding the fundamentals of
cell-material interactions and the inﬂuence on basic cellular processes."
10738269,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Platelets play central roles in hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet activation triggers secretion and release of contents
from α-granules, δ-granules and lysosomes that in turn leads to the recruitment and aggregation of additional platelets and
a myriad of physiological responses. While impaired platelet function is associated with disorders that manifest with
moderate to severe bleeding, excessive platelet aggregation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to its effect in
cardiovascular disease and stroke. Alpha-granules are crucial to these platelet functions both in health and disease. However,
in spite of the relevance of platelet α-granules for human health, remarkably little is known about their biogenesis. Therefore,
our goal is to understand the pathways and molecular mechanism responsible for the biogenesis of platelet α-granules.
 Mutations in VPS33B, VPS16B and NBEAL2 cause the α-granule deficiency and bleeding manifestations observed in
patients suffering Arthrogryposis, Renal Dysfunction and Cholestasis (ARC) syndrome and Gray Platelet syndrome (GPS).
However, the mechanism of action of these proteins in α-granule biogenesis is a mystery. Consequently, a major objective
of this proposal is to address the function of VPS33B, VPS16B and NBEAL2 at the cellular and molecular level.
 Platelet α-granules are produced in the megakaryocyte, the platelet precursor cell. In addition to soluble proteins taken
up by endocytosis, α-granules contain hundreds of proteins synthesized by the megakaryocyte. The pathways taken by
megakaryocyte-synthesized proteins to reach the α-granule are unknown. In this proposal, we show that the sorting
endosome is a fundamental precursor organelle in α-granule formation that is used by megakaryocyte-synthesized proteins.
This implies a more complex biogenesis mechanism than previously anticipated. In this application we build on our novel
findings, hypothesizing that fundamental components of the α-granule biogenesis machinery work at the megakaryocyte
sorting endosome by regulating vesicular trafficking. We propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the transport
pathways followed by newly synthesized α-granule soluble and membrane proteins using an innovative method to
synchronize and evaluate transport of proteins to α-granules in real time. We will test the hypothesis that there are multiple,
separate pathways followed by megakaryocyte-synthesized α-granule proteins and test whether α-granules segregate into
distinct populations. Aim 2 will define the molecular mechanism of platelet α-granule biogenesis by: (i) testing the
hypothesis that VPS33B and VPS16B regulate the SNARE-mediated fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles containing α-granule
cargo with sorting endosomes; (ii) addressing the function of novel components of the transport machinery identified here,
including a new complex that coordinates α-granule cargo traffic through sorting endosomes; (iii) testing the hypothesis
that NBEAL2 mediates the exit of α-granule cargo from sorting endosomes in association with actin and Vac14.
 This research will transform our view of the platelet α-granule field by bringing about a highly mechanistic
understanding of the biogenesis process. Our work will yield insights into the bleeding and myelofibrosis manifestations
observed in ARC and GPS patients. Ultimately, this knowledge will help design new strategies for the treatment of bleeding
and thrombotic disorders and other diseases in which α-granules have emerging roles including angiogenesis and cancer."
10758534,"Project 1: Dynamic functional brain network phenotypes associated with vulnerability to hazardous
 alcohol consumption
Paul Laurienti, Colleen Hanlon, Heather Shappell, Mohsen Bahrami
This project is a continuation of the human neuroimaging studies examining brain networks associated with
drinking behaviors in the Wake Forest Translational Alcohol Research Center (WF-TARC). The overarching
hypothesis of this proposal that the vulnerability to develop hazardous drinking is manifest in dynamic network
connectivity within and between the default mode network (DMN) salience network (SN) and the sensorimotor
network (SMN). This hypothesis is based on a growing body of resting-state brain network studies suggesting
that hazardous drinking and AUD are associated with decreased DMN connectivity and increased SN and
SMN connectivity. However, much more research needed on these three intrinsic brain networks, particularly
evaluation of network dynamics. The primary goals of this project are to: (Aims 1 & 2) evaluate the network
dynamics associated with the development of hazardous drinking and (Aim 3) determine if non-invasive brain
stimulation directed at the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), a node in the DMN, modulates the network
dynamics. To achieve these goals the current study will use advanced quantitative analytics based on Hidden
Semi-Markov Modeling (HSMM) and machine learning predictive analytics to identify and characterize
functional brain network dynamics associated with vulnerability to developing hazardous drinking. The National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) is a longitudinal study that
collected brain imaging and alcohol consumption history from adolescents over a 4-year period. This de-
identified and publically available dataset will be used to examine brain network dynamics associated with
hazardous drinking (Aims 1 and 2). We will also use de-identified longitudinal brain imaging data collected
before and after individuals with AUD received a course of continuous theta burst stimulation (TBS) or sham
treatment to the MPFC. This an ideal dataset to determine if dynamic network connectivity within and between
the DMN, SN, and SMN is responsive to non-invasive neuromodulation. Understanding the dynamic
interconnectivity within and between these circuits can guide future research designed to identify network-
based treatment strategies. For example, research on new targets for TBS delivery or behavioral interventions
that that rely on particular circuits can utilize information about individual dynamic connectivity profiles based
on the outcomes of the proposed studies."
10758548,"Project 3: Adolescent vulnerability to chronic ethanol: neurophysiological, molecular, and behavioral
 mechanisms of adult AUD
Brian McCool, Kimberly Raab-Graham
The neurobiological mechanisms controlling the transition from alcohol use to abuse are poorly understood.
Our overall approach is to examine vulnerable populations to highlight specific cellular/molecular pathways
involved in this transition. For example, human adolescents exposed to heavy alcohol use are at much greater
risk for the development of alcoholism as adults. Recent studies suggest similar liabilities for adolescent
animals including rodents. Our published work indicates chronic ethanol exposure differentially modulates both
glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the lateral/basolateral amygdala (BLA), a ‘node’ within
circuits critical for the integration cognitive and sensory information during emotional responses, in an input-
specific fashion. We provide preliminary evidence within this application that chronic ethanol differentially
facilitates glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission onto young adult BLA neurons projecting to the
nucleus accumbens core (BLANAc cells) and those projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BLABNST
cells). These effects are both input- and sex-specific. Together our findings strongly suggest that chronic
ethanol differentially influences BLA neurons that control both reward- and aversion-like responses. The overall
goal of the current project is to therefore to understand the neurobiological, molecular, and behavioral
vulnerabilities of adolescent rats compared to mature adults. We will specifically test the central hypothesis that
periadolescent vulnerability to chronic ethanol is conferred by unique neurobiological and molecular responses
within distinct reward/aversion circuits. The proposed work includes three specific aims: Aim 1 will characterize
age-dependent vulnerability of BLA neurophysiology within BLANAc and BLABNST neurons; Aim 2 will help us
understand the molecular basis for adolescent circuit- and sex-specific vulnerability to chronic ethanol; and,
Aim 3 will define the behavioral consequences of circuit- and sex-specific functional/molecular adaptations
within the BLA. Together these aims are significant because they leverage a vulnerable population
(adolescents), innovative technical and conceptual approaches, and the substantial expertise of our research
team to help identify specific cellular signaling processes governing the impact of ethanol exposure across
multiple levels of analysis. We will also directly test if these processes represent potential therapeutic targets
for treatments designed to interrupt the transition from ethanol use to abuse."
10758555,"PROJECT 4: Convergent behavioral and neurobiological adaptations promoted by rodent models of
 vulnerability to alcohol use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder
 Jeff Weiner, Sara Jones, Robert Gould, Eva Bach, and Lindsey Kuiper
Individuals diagnosed with PTSD are up to four times more likely to develop alcohol use disorder (AUD) and
most evidence suggests that PTSD usually precedes the development of AUD. Anxiety, depression, and sleep
disruptions are significant risk factors for AUD as well as major symptoms of both disorders. Despite the
clinical importance of this problem, the neural mechanisms responsible for the frequent co-occurance of these
disorders are not fully understood. The overarching goal of this project is to employ a rodent early life social
isolation (eSI) model of AUD vulnerability and a PTSD model, single prolonged stress, to test the hypothesis
that both stressors promote similar behavioral phenotypes that are mediated by convergent neural adaptations.
These studies will also determine if the “double hit” of eSI + SPS exacerbates these maladaptive changes and
test a therapeutic intervention to mitigate these effects. Behavioral studies will focus on measures of anxiety-
like behavior and negative affect, deficits in fear extinction, and ethanol self-administration. Neurobiological
studies will test the innovative hypothesis that these models strengthen a glutamatergic projection from the
ventral subiculum (vSub) to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc). Extensive evidence suggests that stress
enhances vSub-NAc activity and that stimulation of this pathway modulates many AUD/PTSD-related
behaviors (e.g. motivation, negative affect) and indirectly increases accumbal dopamine (DA) release.
Although this circuit is thought to play an integral role in many neuropsychiatric disorders, it has been largely
ignored in the AUD field. To address this knowledge gap, multidisciplinary in vivo and ex vivo approaches will
be employed to test the hypotheses that eSI + SPS strengthens vSub-NAc shell synaptic excitation and alters
NAc shell DA release dynamics, in part via an increase in kappa opioid receptor function. These studies will
also determine if the double hit increases ethanol-stimulated NAc DA release and use closed loop in vivo
optogenetics and pharmacological approaches to determine if these synaptic adaptations play a causal role in
the ethanol drinking phenotypes promoted by these models. A final aim will use longitudinal wireless EEG to
determine if eSI + SPS and ethanol drinking disrupt sleep architecture and duration and whether these
changes can be mitigated by a kappa opioid receptor antagonist. Collectively, these studies will provide the
first detailed characterization of the effects of eSI and SPS on critical behavioral phenotypes associated with
AUD vulnerability and PTSD. Complementary neurobiological studies may identify a relatively uncharacterized
hippocamapal-striatal circuitry that contributes to these maladaptive behaviors."
10757889,"Project Summary/Abstract: Overall Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC)
 The Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) has devoted more than three decades to understanding
alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk using neuroscientific and behavioral genetic tools. This prior work leads us to
study the heritable, neurobiological, and behavioral factors that drive binge and high-intensity drinking (BHID).
Most research on BHID focuses on harm from numbers of drinks or level of alcohol exposure but does not
account for “front-loading”— the initial rapid drinking to ostensibly enhance alcohol’s rate of change in the brain
and its resulting effects. Although such drinking is initially more intoxicating, compensatory (neuro-)
adaptations can create an acute tolerance to rewarding effects, which in turn induces a need to increase
consumption. Judgments about the next drink can then be affected so as to sustain intake, pushing alcohol
exposure into high-intensity levels. The long-term goal of the IARC is to deploy its multidisciplinary efforts to
understand the heritable origins of responses to alcohol and development of AUD. The objective of this next
IARC cycle is to study brain circuits and behaviors that influence both the rapid front-loading and sustained
drinking behaviors that elevate alcohol concentration to hazardous, high-intensity levels. In studies of both
humans and our selected, alcohol-preferring animals, our specific aims will be to: (1) Study human neural,
perceptual, and subject factors that relate to: a) preferences for a steeper rise in alcohol concentration and b)
acute tolerance to a sustained binge-level exposure; (2) Study heritable differences in the structure and
function of frontal brain circuitry hypothesized to underlie front-loading, high drinking, and behavioral inhibition
in rat lines selected for high alcohol intake; (3) Study heritable differences in insula circuits hypothesized to
mediate front-loading and subsequent sustained high drinking in rat lines selected for high alcohol intake, as
well as potential related contributors to high intensity drinking; and (4) Study how adaptation in glutamatergic
input to the dorsomedial striatum from basolateral amygdala and insula contributes to alcohol tolerance, driving
a) sustained high-intensity drinking in the high-consuming cHAP mouse line, and b) binge-like drinking in the
C56BL/6J inbred mouse strain. These projects are supported by service cores to (5) provide selected lines of
alcohol-preferring and animals and (6) conduct higher-level network-analyses and computational modeling of
results from the research components. (7) A Pilot Core assists new investigators to alcohol research and
explores new ideas, while (8) an Information and Dissemination Core educates and advises the community,
schools, healthcare providers, and state policy makers about both BHID and AUD. The IARC thus functions in
a coordinated way to integrate human and animal research, and to determine how heritable risk and alcohol
exposure contribute to BHID."

This NIAAA Alcohol Research Center (ARC) Grant is the catalytic element that integrates a large group of
investigators across the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The UNC School of Medicine Bowles
Center for Alcohol Studies (BCAS), provides a foundation of administrative support and dedicated space for
alcohol research. The UNC ARC fosters interdisciplinary collaborative research on alcohol use disorders, alcohol
abuse and the impact of alcohol on health and disease - exactly the goal of an NIAAA ARC. The ARC has
facilitated the growth and development of UNC into an outstanding alcohol research university, among the best
in the world. Research and education have always centered on a theme of molecular pathogenesis of alcohol
use disorders. This renewal focuses on alcohol-induced circuit pathology that underlies addiction. Ultimately, our
guiding hypothesis is that alcohol-induced molecular signaling disruption and dysregulation of neural circuitry
drives pathological behaviors and is thus the key cause of all alcohol-related pathology.
This fifth renewal of the UNC ARC continues an emphasis on alcohol use disorder pathogenesis, integrating
new leadership of existing faculty and new team members to investigate changes in neural circuits and molecular
signaling in models of AUD as well as humans. The scope of these studies addresses the critical neurobiological
changes leading to alcohol-related pathologies, i.e., the mechanisms leading to heavy chronic drinking. The
ARC integrates studies of multiple signaling systems and neurocircuits that each focus on specific mechanisms
within and across brain regions. A range of molecular mechanisms that drive these circuit alterations will be
explored, particularly excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance - a theme that will be interrogated at multiple levels of
analysis in all the brain circuits. Some Research Components also include the translational endpoint, functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity of pathological circuits in the Scientific Resource Core. This
approach is expected to increase discovery, improve models and gain strength from common assessments
across preclinical models to the ARC human studies.
This ARC renewal continues to be the catalytic element that integrates a broad group of investigators, pairing
senior and junior faculty within ARC components that promote discovery across the BCAS and UNC. This
proposal connects 11 independently funded faculty across multiple themes and projects. The ARC Information
Dissemination Core informs practicing health professionals, professional and college students as well as youth
through specific alcohol curricula for each group to have the greatest impact on health.
In summary, the ARC will conduct, promote, support, and mentor research on the pathogenesis of alcohol use
disorders and educate broad groups of the public, including health professionals, families, college students and
youth in North Carolina on the causes and prevention of these disorders."

Access to cutting-edge imaging technologies and high-end instrumentation significantly enhances the
capabilities of Research Components by providing rigorous methods, sophisticated facilities, user support, and
quality control of imaging. Second, the SRC provides facilities, resources, and expertise to allow measurement
of alcohol-induced changes in gene and protein expression and neural circuit function including optogenetics
and electrophysiology. These centralized facilities allow rigorous, standardized, and quality-controlled data
collection across a variety of models, and extend the capability of Research Components to include novel

I am a developmental-behavioral pediatrician who has earned an MS in Clinical Research. My long-term goal
is to become an independent researcher focused on advancing developmental-behavioral outcomes of
children from diverse, underserved groups by improving their adherence to treatment plans for mental health
conditions, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). My current objective, which represents the
next step in pursuit of this goal, is to develop a culturally-tailored family navigator Intervention to Improve
ADHD-Related Treatment adherence (I2-ART) for minority children using a systematic, patient-centered,
iterative approach consistent with the ORBIT model for behavioral intervention development. Key elements of
the career development plan to support both my long-term goal and current objective include training in (1) the
design and evaluation of clinical and mental health services trials to improve treatment adherence, (2) health
disparities and community-partnered research, and (3) effective grant and manuscript writing. My mentorship
team includes NIH-funded investigators with expertise in ADHD, clinical trial design, treatment adherence,
health disparities, and community-partnership research. Furthermore, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which
ranks #2 among U.S. children’s hospitals for NIH funding, provides an outstanding research environment and
strong support for junior faculty, including >30 current recipients of NIH Career Development Awards.
Proposed Research: ADHD is the most common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder and is associated with
significant long-term impairments. Current guidelines recommend stimulant medication and/or behavioral
therapy as first-line treatments for ADHD. Despite evidence that consistent treatment is important for effectively
managing ADHD symptoms, treatment adherence remains suboptimal and is especially problematic among
minority children. Hypothesized reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD treatment include uncertainties
about medication efficacy and side effects, distrust of the health care system, and decreased access to mental
health services. This study aims to develop and test the I2-ART intervention to improve treatment adherence in
minority (Latinx and African American) children with ADHD. The proposed study involves three ORBIT phases:
During phase 1a, we will conduct focus groups with key stakeholders (i.e., caregivers, clinicians, and family
navigators, n=24) to identify and develop I2-ART’s basic elements. Next, during phase 1b, we will train four
family navigators to implement I2-ART with caregivers of treatment-naïve children with ADHD (n=8-12) in order
to determine feasibility and acceptability. In phase 2, we will use phase 1b findings to modify I2-ART as
needed, and then will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the revised I2-ART (n=40), compared to the “usual
care” control condition (n=20), on ADHD treatment adherence. The preliminary data collected during the
proposed study will inform a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial to examine I2-ART efficacy."

10669774,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My career goal is to develop an independent research program focused on improving communication
for children with advancing cancer and their families.
When parents understand prognosis, children with advancing cancer are more likely to receive palliative care
and interventions to alleviate suffering. Most patients and parents want clear prognostic information, yet our
preliminary data show that pediatric oncologists often delay or censor poor prognostic disclosure.
This K08 Application describes a career development plan that will enable me to evolve into a successful
independent clinical investigator with a career focused on improving communication in pediatric cancer care.
The short-term goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based, stakeholder-driven prognostic
communication guide and documentation template to support timely prognostic disclosure in the setting of
advancing childhood cancer. First, we will interview patients, parents, and oncologists to define stakeholder
preferences and recommendations for timing, content, and delivery of prognostic information (Research Aim 1).
Second, we will facilitate a Stakeholder Panel to develop a conceptual framework and design a patient/parent-
centered prognostic communication guide and documentation template, which will undergo usability and
cognitive testing with oncologist beta testers. If advised by stakeholders, we will develop and test patient/parent-
centered tools as well (Research Aim 2). Third, we will assess intervention feasibility and acceptability in a single-
arm pilot study with pediatric oncologists and advancing cancer patient-parent dyads (Research Aim 3).
This career development award will prepare me to achieve my long-term goals as an independent investigator
at the intersection of pediatric cancer, palliative care, and communication research. Through structured
mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on clinical research experience, I will expand my training in the
science of measuring and modifying communication behaviors (Training Aims 1-3), learn and apply participatory
design methods to engage pediatric cancer stakeholders, particularly children, in data synthesis (Training Aim
2), acquire formal training and practical experience with designing interventions for dissemination (Training Aims
2-3), and gain knowledge and skills in clinical trial design and conduct (Training Aim 3).
Upon completion of this Award, I will have the data and skills to study this intervention in a multi-site randomized
control trial, as the basis for a future R01 submission. The rigorous training provided by this Award will prepare
me for a career dedicated to improving communication for children with advancing cancer and their families."
10854718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over 20,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the United States annually, and over half will die
within five years. Outcomes have changed little in the last 20 years, highlighting the need for more effective
therapies. One promising new strategy employs immune T cells engineered to target proteins uniquely
overexpressed in tumors; such T cell immunotherapies have the potential to control tumor growth without
toxicity to healthy tissues. My ongoing work targets the antigen mesothelin (Msln), which contributes to
malignancy and invasive progression in ovarian cancer but has limited expression in healthy cells. I showed
that T cells engineered to express a human or mouse Msln-specific high-affinity T cell receptor (TCRMsln) can
kill human ovarian cancer cell lines or the murine ID8 cell line, respectively. In a disseminated ID8 tumor
model, adoptively transferred TCRMsln T cells preferentially accumulated within established tumors, delayed
ovarian tumor growth and significantly prolonged mouse survival. However, data also revealed that the ovarian
tumor microenvironment (TME) limits engineered T cell persistence and anti-cancer efficacy.
 Tumor-specific T cells express inhibitory receptors upon encountering antigen, reducing antitumor cytokine
production. I detected the ligands for the PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 inhibitory receptors (immune checkpoints)
expressed in human and ID8 ovarian tumors. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating TCRMsln T cells expressed PD-1, Tim-
3 and Lag-3, which correlated with reduced cytokine production. I hypothesized that immune checkpoint
blockade could overcome inhibitory receptor ligation-driven suppression of engineered T cells. Therefore, I
treated tumor-bearing mice with TCRMsln T cells plus anti-PD-1, anti-Tim-3 and/or anti-Lag-3 checkpoint-
blocking antibodies, targeting up to three inhibitory receptors simultaneously. Triple checkpoint blockade
dramatically increased anti-tumor cytokine production by intratumoral TCRMsln T cells, but treatment also
produced greater off-tumor toxicities.
 I now propose to use preclinical mouse models (Aim 1) and a novel human slice culture system (Aim 2) to
interrogate the transcriptomic and functional changes that occur in engineered T cells and the ovarian TME
after checkpoint blockade. I plan to use T cell engineering to knock down endogenous inhibitory receptor
expression in tumor-specific T cells and determine if anti-tumor function is improved without the immune-
related toxicities observed with systemic combination checkpoint blockade. Many solid tumors overexpress
Msln and share the same T cell inhibitory pathways. Therefore, the findings from these new studies will likely
inform the development of clinically-relevant T cell engineering strategies that are more resistant to immune
suppression within the solid TME of many malignancies."
10757348,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Functional activation of the cerebral cortex creates a robust increase in local temperature by increasing blood
flow and metabolism because of neurovascular coupling. Changes in surface brain temperature while an
awake patient performs a motor, sensory, or language task can be used to infer spatial patterns of activity to
create functional maps. Awake neurosurgery is used in the management of drug-resistant epilepsy, glioma,
and neurovascular malformation, in order to localize seizure and/or physiologic activity. Protection of key
functional areas is imperative to avoiding postoperative neurologic deficits. Currently, direct electrical
stimulation (DES) is the most commonly used method of intraoperative surgical mapping, which identifies
functionally critical brain regions so they are not resected. However, DES has low spatial resolution (~1 cm),
may provoke seizures, and can only test one area at a time. This project investigates a new method of
intraoperative functional mapping based on infrared thermography, which has high resolution (~100 micron)
and simultaneously monitors the entire exposed brain surface without risk for seizures. The Intraoperative
Mapping System will be developed and tested on glioma patients, as tumors have relatively static impact on
brain temperature compared to epileptogenic foci and vascular malformations. Preliminary data in motor and
language mapping cases shows large (~0.5oC) positive thermal activation of contralateral motor cortex and
language regions that have strong agreement with DES. Aim 1 will develop a mapping system (hardware and
software) required to conduct real-time thermal-based brain mapping during awake craniotomy. We will
optimize and integrate the infrared recording procedure within the surgical workflow, to maximize signal quality
while minimizing treatment interference. The central piece is a mobile cart containing a powerful workstation
and an articulating arm to locate the IR camera over the craniotomy. The computer will deliver stimuli, monitor
and collect behavioral data (audio, video, and a wireless haptic glove), record the IR images, and display the
real-time functional map. Patient tasks currently used during DES will be adapted for thermographic recording.
Aim 2 will explore the temporal and spatial properties of the thermodynamic response to optimize the infrared
mapping procedure. The thermal response function (TRF) is the thermal equivalent of the hemodynamic
response function (HRF) that is used in fMRI. Through modeling and high resolution (spatial and temporal) IR
data, we will estimate the thermal impulse response and use it to develop an efficient multi-task mapping
protocol. The result will be a rapid, efficient, high resolution assessment of brain function to optimize the
resection and improve patient outcomes. Aim 3 will compare the functional mapping methods (DES and
infrared thermal imaging) to determine optimal synergy between them to provide the best information for the
safest resection. If successful, this project will create a new method for intraoperative functional mapping
during awake neurosurgery. Ultimately, we hope to improve the precision of intraoperative brain mapping while
increasing the safety and efficacy of surgery for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, glioma, and
neurovascular malformations."

10741766,"ABSTRACT
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe thrombotic disorder initiated by ultralarge immune
complexes (ULICs) containing IgG antibodies to a multivalent antigen composed of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and
heparin (H). Patients with HIT are at risk for death, amputation, recurrent thromboembolism and bleeding while
receiving maximally tolerated doses of factor Xa or direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs). Thus, there is an unmet
need for deeper insight into the pathobiology of thrombosis in HIT that will lead to targeted novel non-
anticoagulant interventions to supplement contemporary therapy. Our published and pilot data demonstrate that
activation of the complement pathway fulfills this gap. Specifically, we show that HIT ULICs: 1) interact and bind
complement components and von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers, 2) generate soluble complement
components via the classical pathway, 3) deposit C3 on neutrophils, monocytes and endothelial cells (ECs), 4)
trigger complement-dependent neutrophil degranulation, monocyte tissue factor (TF) and procoagulant activity
upstream of C5, 5) activate complement even in the presence of DTIs, and 6) promote complement deposition
in a murine thrombosis model of HIT. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that complement activation by
HIT ULICs contributes to the prothrombotic state in HIT through direct EC injury mediated by surface expressed
complement receptors (CRs) and by amplifying signaling by promoting cooperativity with FcRIIA on neutrophils
and monocytes. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Examine HIT ULIC-complement interactions and
effects of complement activation on ECs We will test the hypothesis that incorporation of complement enlarges
and stabilizes assembled ULICs, impairs complement regulatory function, and promotes EC injury leading to
release of vWF multimers that further amplify ULIC formation and complement activation. 2) Examine
cooperative interactions of HIT ULICs, complement and monocyte/neutrophil FcR. We will test the hypothesis
that complement-containing ULICS amplify FcRIIA signaling by promoting cooperativity with cellular CRs on
neutrophils and monocytes. We will examine the effects of ULIC composition on cell activation, identify CRs
involved in binding HIT ULICs, study soluble and cellular complement regulatory mechanisms, and characterize
complement activation in seropositive patients with and without HIT. 3) Examine complement inhibition as a
therapeutic strategy for thrombosis in HIT. We will use microfluidic assays and murine thrombosis models to
test the hypothesis that activation of the classical complement pathway by HIT ULICs promotes macrovascular
thrombosis through release of vWF from activated ECs and amplification of cellular procoagulant activity. We
will examine the efficacy of proximal and terminal complement pathway inhibition as a strategy to lower the
intensity of antithrombotic therapy needed to treat HIT. Together, these studies will provide new insights into IC-
mediated thrombosis broadly and provide a detailed mechanistic pathway for complement inhibition as a
rationale, potent and non anticoagulant-dependent strategy for the treatment of HIT."

There is urgent need for easy-to- operate and rapidly deployable diagnostic tools that can handle blood samples in a closed sample-to-answer manner. Here, we propose to develop a novel diagnostic technology that can detect viral antigens in an inexpensive, ultrasensitive, specific, and multiplexed manner. We will develop our novel approach into standalone tool with a detection capability at attomolar sensitivities (comparable to nucleic acid amplification tests) to diagnose arboviral infections with minimal user interference. The integrated diagnostic platform will utilize a novel surrogate approach, microfluidic integration, and a multiplexed detection scheme with the capacity to distinguish arboviral infections. The system will be designed to initiate diagnosis from serum/plasma/blood and provide a sample-to-answer diagnostic within less than 35 minutes using less than 100 µL blood samples at a cost of $2 per test. Collaborative work proposed for this NIH/NIAID R01 Grant involves integration of nanophotonic engineering (Yanik Group), molecular virology (Pinsky Group), and infectious diseases epidemiology (LaBeaud Group) to build and field-test our novel point-of-care viral diagnostic platform with Windward Islands Research and Education Foundation (WINDREF) and St. George’s University teams (Macpherson, Waechter and Noel Groups). Preliminary validation tests with patient samples will be initially performed at Stanford Medical Facility in collaboration with LaBeaud and Pinsky groups. Subsequently, three prototypes will be transferred to Grenada for field-testing initially at central laboratories then to resource-poor settings in small towns. Yanik group will provide the necessary expertise for integration of molecular and nanoengineering components and demonstration of a practical prototype as well as evaluating the application of prototype(s) developed under this proposal with patient samples (LaBeaud and Pinsky Groups). System will be iteratively optimized and a rugged platform suitable for field settings will be developed."

10758539,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) persists as a costly public health problem that lacks widely effective medications and
preventive strategies. The overarching premise of this Project, like others in the WF-TARC, is that the neural
substrates that contribute to vulnerability and resilience to AUD are not fully understood. Studies using
nonhuman primates (NHP) have advantages that make them a critical part of a comprehensive, translational
approach to addressing this topic. This project continues and extends work accomplished in the ongoing funding
cycle. Aim 1 will extend our characterization of 12 group-housed male cynomolgus monkeys who have been
drinking ethanol (EtOH) for >2 years. We will assess brain structure, function and connectivity using MRI. In
addition, in the current funding cycle we implemented home cage cognitive testing using touchscreen hardware
and software that we developed. We will assess two clinically relevant characteristics: behavioral flexibility (with
a stimulus discrimination and reversal task) and impulsive choice (with a delay discounting task). We will also
characterize resistance to punishment by assessing the ability of the bitter tastant quinine to decrease EtOH
consumption. We hypothesize that these measures will differ between heavy and light drinkers. Next, EtOH
access will be discontinued, modeling abstinence, and Aim 2 will assess these same measures over the
following year. We expect to observe increases in cognitive function, resistance to punishment, grey matter
volumes, white matter integrity and functional connectivity in all monkeys but that this “recovery” will be slower
and less complete in monkeys that had higher EtOH intakes prior to discontinuation. During this EtOH-free period
we will also assess reactivity to EtOH-paired cues in a model of relapse. Finally, access to EtOH will be reinstated
and Aim 3 will examine the efficacy of putative pharmacotherapies whose potential is suggested by other WF-
TARC projects. Drugs will be administered chronically when monkeys have access to EtOH 6 hrs/day (modeling
moderate drinking) and, later, 22 hrs/day (modeling heavy drinking). We hypothesize that putative medications
will be more efficacious in light vs. heavy drinkers. When these data are combined with findings from other WF-
TARC projects, specific candidates will emerge with a strong preclinical profile to suggest their utility in treating
AUD. These NHP studies occupy a critical position in the translational structure of the WF-TARC, supporting
forward and backward translation to inform and extend findings in rodent and human projects. Taken together,
the results of the studies in this Project, particularly in combination with data generated in other components of
the WF-TARC, will provide a comprehensive account of brain differences between populations that are resistant
versus vulnerable to AUD. This knowledge will ultimately help practitioners direct preventive efforts to groups
who will most benefit from them and will identify new targets for more effective medications that can be targeted
to the most vulnerable populations."

The overall goal of this “Pediatric Center of Excellence in Nephrology” is to provide a coordinated,
interdisciplinary approach to study the development of the kidney vasculature during embryonic, fetal and
postnatal life. The main theme of this Research Center is “Regulation of Cell Fate during Kidney Development
and Disease.” Broadly, the proposed research deals with fundamental questions of clinical relevance in Pediatric
Nephrology such as the understanding of the proper development, and the structural and functional maintenance
of the kidney vasculature in health and disease. The experimental approaches range from examination of
epigenetic mechanisms that control cell fate, plasticity, and identity and the cellular signals underlying the
phenotypic transformation that occurs when homeostasis is threatened in early life. Project 1 will investigate the
role of renin cell progenitors in the development and pathology of the kidney arterioles (R. Ariel Gomez and
Maria Luisa Sequeira Lopez). Project 2 will define how the TGFb/FGF2 axis controls the fate of renin and
vascular smooth muscle cells under conditions that threaten homeostasis in infancy (Patricio Ray, Agnes
Swiatecka-Urban and Jennifer Charlton). Pilot and Feasibility projects within the general theme of the Center
will be solicited at a national level from universities at large, the ASPN, the ASN and adult nephrology programs
with the objective to add new talent to the investigation of renal diseases in children. This will be done in
coordination with the other 2 PCENs to avoid overlap and guarantee the best outcome for each project. A cutting-
edge Core in Single Cell Epigenomics, Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics (Nathan Sheffield, Silvia
Medrano) will add scientific and technical expertise to individual laboratories within and outside the Center. The
Center will be supported by an Administrative Core which will allocate and distribute resources to Center
participants, implement the Opportunity Pool Program with procedures for soliciting and selecting candidates for
Pilot and Feasibility Awards, maintain a Center Website and an Enrichment / Educational program to provide
resources for support of research students, the development of repository data, workshops, seminars, and
symposia to enhance research in kidney development and disease. This Pediatric Center of Excellence in
Nephrology has the necessary expertise, diverse manpower, focus, commitment, and institutional support to
accomplish the proposed goals. It is anticipated that the Center of Excellence will lead to improved
management of infants and children with renal diseases and hypertension."
10745651,"Abstract
 Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) are mobile genetic elements that are present in all mammalian
genomes. Most mammalian SINEs can be subdivided into two general categories: (1) those derived from 7SL
signal recognition particle RNA (e.g., human Alu elements); and (2) those derived from transfer RNAs (e.g.,
canine SINEC_Cf elements). Alu and SINEC_Cf elements have had a major impact on genome evolution and
comprise an astounding ~11% and ~15% of human and canine genomic DNA, respectively. The vast majority
of SINEs have been rendered immobile by mutational processes; however, some human-specific Alu elements
and canine SINEC_Cf elements can mobilize to new genomic locations by a “copy and paste” mechanism
termed retrotransposition. To date, greater than 76 independent germline Alu retrotransposition events have
been implicated as the cause of human diseases, including cancer. SINEC_Cf retrotransposition events are
responsible for various diseases and phenotypic differences in canines. SINEs do not encode proteins; thus,
they are classified as `non-autonomous' retrotransposons. Previous studies, including our preliminary data,
demonstrate that a protein encoded by an autonomous Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon
(LINE-1 ORF2p) is required for Alu and SINEC_Cf element retrotransposition. We hypothesize that the
structure of Alu RNA, and by extension SINEC_Cf RNA, and unidentified host factor(s) allow these RNAs to
localize to the ribosome, where they can compete with the LINE-1 poly(A) tail for LINE-1 ORF2p binding to
promote their retrotransposition. Here, we propose to use a combination of molecular biological, evolutionary
inference, genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to: (1) use established RNA secondary structure
models, Illumina-based SHAPE-MaP chemical probing, and established cultured cell assays to uncover cis-
acting RNA structures and sequences required for human-specific Alu and SINEC_Cf retrotransposition; and
(2) exploit differences between HeLa cell isolates that differ in their ability to support Alu and SINEC_Cf
retrotransposition to identify host factor(s) critical for SINE retrotransposition. This proposal builds on
successful collaborations between the Moran and Kidd laboratories at the University of Michigan and will
combine the Moran laboratory's expertise in transposable element and RNA biology with the Kidd laboratory's
expertise in computational and statistical genomics and evolutionary biology to elucidate SINE
retrotransposition mechanisms."

Investigating Syndecan-1 in Hepcidin Regulation and Iron Metabolism. Iron is an essential trace mineral,
involved in many vital cellular and organismal functions. Organismal iron content is controlled by dietary
absorption, iron partitioning in erythrocytes, iron recycling by macrophages and iron storage in hepatocytes.
The hormone, hepcidin is a master regulator of systemic iron content as it negatively regulates ferroportin, the
primary cellular iron exporter mediating iron flow from enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes into the
circulation. We have shown that heparan sulfate is key component of hepcidin regulation. Inhibition of heparan
sulfate biosynthesis in hepatoma cells and in mice reduces baseline, BMP6-stimulated, and IL6-stimulated
hepcidin expression and worsens the pathophysiology characteristic of anemia of inflammation. We have now
identified syndecan-1 as the primary HSPG regulating liver hepcidin expression based on genetic and
pharmacological inactivation of syndecan-1 expression in human and mouse hepatoma cells. Our findings
imply that endogenous hepatic syndecan-1 serves as a template to support signaling complexes regulating
hepcidin expression and iron metabolism. We propose to extend our studies to human hepatocytes; to
determine the mechanism underlying the requirement for Sdc1-mediated regulation of hepcidin
expression; and to exploit this information to develop strategies to treat disorders characterized by
iron overloading. To achieve these goals, we will (i) Examine the role of syndecan-1 in driving basal and iron-
inducible hepcidin expression in human hepatocytes; (ii) Determine the mechanism of syndecan-1 regulation of
hepcidin expression and (iii) Evaluate the efficacy of genetic and pharmacological syndecan-1 targeting to
correct iron dyshomeostasis in iron-loading disease models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
evaluate the relationship of syndecan-1 structure to iron metabolism, with the long-range goal of defining new
potential targets to reduce the risk of iron-loading disorders, such as anemia of inflammation."

Project Summary/Abstract
 Reducing the prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) requires an approach in which intervention
and education are widely accessible and on a continuum from the beginning stages of use (e.g., prevention) to
problematic, risky, and disorder-levels of use (e.g., intervention). Stakeholders in AUD prevention and care
include patients, family members, health care providers, community institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals),
lawmakers, and the general community. The theme of this Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) is to
investigate factors that contribute to risky, binge and high-intensity drinking behaviors (BHID). The long-term
goal of this Core is to collaborate with our community partners to improve outcomes for AUD across the state
of Indiana. Our work is driven by the needs of these partners and will be guided by a community-based
participatory research (CBPR) framework. The objective of this Core is to serve as a bridge for the strong
expertise and empirical science conducted in our IARC and engagement with our community – with the
ultimate goal of increasing public knowledge about the scientific underpinnings of AUD, especially in under-
resourced communities, and improving AUD outcomes. Specific Aim 1: Disseminate findings on adolescent
alcohol use and AUD outcomes as well as prevention programming material to school partners to increase
public knowledge of adolescent alcohol use and AUD and increase access to adolescent substance use
prevention programming, particularly among underserved youth and communities. We plan to engage with our
school partners by providing educational material on the prevalence, risk factors for and consequences of
adolescent alcohol use and BHID for school administration, teachers, and school mental health providers (e.g.,
school nurses and guidance counselors). We have also created dissemination material fora school-based
substance use prevention program and plan to further engage with our school partners by training
professionals within school settings to deliver the prevention program across the state, particularly in
underserved communities. Specific Aim 2: Serve as an educative and advisory body for our community
partners in a way that allows for the broadest reaching impact on AUD services and policy in the state of
Indiana. We plan to engage with our community by creating 1) an AUD training program for healthcare
providers; 2) expert services for educational, community, and client advocacy agencies, and 3) an amplified
website presence and accessibility for ongoing IARC experts and resources. Through these two aims, we seek
to improve community education on the science of AUD. The positive impact of our proposed work will be
in reducing prevalence of and improving outcomes for youth with AUD throughout the state of Indiana by
expanding access to AUD science programming, and by helping inform science-based policy, provider
education, and community awareness. We also seek to enhance our IARC’s relationships with community
partners across Indiana."
10757909,"Project Summary and Abstract
Binge and high-intensity drinking (BHID) represent a significant threat to health and increase the risk for
developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms and
neurobiology of BHID to improve prevention and treatment. Most research has focused on amount consumed
or alcohol concentration obtained; the rate (speed) of drinking is nevertheless understudied. Our central
hypothesis is that people maximize and maintain perceived reward by controlling both the rate and magnitude
of consumption. This behavior is modified by genetics, experience and tolerance. This component’s objectives
are to determine the relationship between how quickly a participant self-administers to the binge threshold (80
mg/dL), a model of preclinical “front loading” sensitive to BHID, and 1) acute tolerance to rewarding subjective
effects at 80 mg/dL, 2) the neurocircuitry of salience, and 3) associated risks such as biological family history
of AUD, sex, lifetime drinking history, and impulsivity.
Our objectives leverage two domains of Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) expertise: intravenous
alcohol administration and neuroimaging. The alcohol clamp provides each participant an identical, steady-
state alcohol concentration during which initial response and acute tolerance can be measured, including that
evident in electrophysiologically measured neurocircuitry. The clamp has been shown to be sensitive to genetic
influence, recent drinking, and impulsivity. In the alcohol self-administration Rate-Control paradigm,
participants precisely and reproducibly adjust rate of change in alcohol concentration every 3 minutes.
Preliminary data reveal that time-to-80 mg/dL (T80) varies with BHID outside the lab, which is in turn
associated with family history of alcoholism (FHA). Our preliminary neuroimaging data further show that an
intensely sweet taste: 1) induces regional SN activation that correlates with the subjective effects of a rapid
alcohol prime and real-life drinking and 2) enhances functional connectivity between salience and ventral
striatal reward areas. Finally, 3) our data show that during mental state transitions brain-wide network
connectivity reconfiguration (including in the SN) is lower in those with FHA. Our specific aims are to: 1.
Characterize relationships between alcohol self-administration rate, acute tolerance, and FHA; 2. Determine
how SN function relates to alcohol’s rate-dependent subjective effects and acute tolerance; 3. Identify brain
network transitions affected by FHA. Success will demonstrate how acute tolerance to alcohol, neural circuitry
and FHA contribute to BHID. The results will provide directions for intervention (e.g., neuromodulation of
reward circuitry to alter the relationship between rate and subjective response) and inform translational study of
this high-risk drinking pattern."
10757913,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the neural circuitry that underlies binge and high intensity drinking (BHID) requires an animal
model that reliably expresses this behavior voluntarily. The alcohol-preferring P rats and the High Alcohol
Drinking HAD rats (both rodent models of a human family history of alcohol use disorder; AUD) have
behavioral profiles prior to any alcohol exposure that suggest two different pathways to AUD: the P rats are
prone to emit behavior, impulsive, and reinforcer-driven; by contrast the HADs are less likely to emit behavior,
not impulsive, and more anxious. In addition, our preliminary data show that the lines and sexes display
different BHID-like intake patterns. Therefore, P and HAD rats show distinct phenotypes that correspond with
“reward” and “relief” drinking, respectively— two risk phenotypes in humans. The objective of this proposal is to
identify hypothesized pathologies in specific neural pathways regulating BHID-like consumption that
correspond to circuits thought to support reward and relief drinking (prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens;
prefrontal cortex to basolateral amygdala). Specifically, this proposal will utilize the combination of (i) animal
models of behaviorally divergent AUD risk in which we (ii) employ tract tracing to reveal key differential circuits
between the lines (iii) that we will in turn manipulate to bidirectionally drive both behavioral impulsivity and
BHID behavior. The significance of this Center Component is that it will discover critical novel mechanisms in
the structure and function of the circuitry regulating endophenotypic risk behaviors (using the stop signal
reaction time task) and alcohol-seeking and BHID (using the operant seeking/drinking paradigm). Moreover,
from these findings, and in conjunction with other IARC projects, we may ultimately learn the underlying
mechanisms for these traits that contribute to the progression to an AUD. Particularly in an era of “precision
medicine”, where drug efficacy can be dependent upon different genetic profiles and drinking patterns, an
understanding of different, genetically-influenced pathways to alcohol dependence must precede development
of effective AUD treatment."

10747341,"An understanding of the normal structure and function of the retina is important to appreciate changes
that occur during disease, development and aging. To this end, a longstanding goal for the field has
been to obtain a unified functional, molecular and morphological classification of the neural cell types in
the primate retina. To address this need, we will use a state-of-the-art approach to interrogate neuronal
function in molecularly-defined ganglion and amacrine cell types in primate retina. Our method
combines two-photon calcium imaging of light-evoked responses with a novel, high-throughput method
to molecularly classify cell types in situ and at unprecedented scale. We will use this integrated
approach to determine the functional properties of molecularly-defined wide-field ganglion cells and
GABAergic amacrine cell types that have hitherto been difficult to target using conventional
electrophysiological approaches. In Aim 1, we will determine the spatiotemporal response properties,
mosaics and morphologies of ganglion cell types that are disproportionately represented in peripheral
retina. In Aim 2, we will examine how regional differences in inhibitory neurons and their connections
shape the functional response properties of the foveal and peripheral retina. We expect that completion
of these aims will reveal novel insights into the distinct cellular and circuit mechanisms that shape
visual processing in the foveal and peripheral retina."
10740868,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, and the relationship
between initial innate immune activity and neurodegeneration is still poorly understood. In this proposed project,
we aim to elucidate how the novel protective role of dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR), is exerted through
crosstalk of myeloid cells infiltrated in the central nervous system (CNS) and CNS-resident cells in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone-induced demyelination (CID) models. Dectin-1 has been
one of the most intensively studied innate immune receptors, detecting fungal cell wall to induce inflammation.
However, we recently found that dectin-1 is a protective molecule in EAE, and the protective role of dectin-1 in
neuroinflammation has not been defined. In particular, the role of dectin-1 in MS/EAE is entirely unknown. Our
preliminary data also strongly suggested that endogenous molecules, expressed at least on astrocytes, trigger
the protective role of dectin-1.
 The goal of this project is to delineate how innate immune activities lead to neuroprotection in EAE. Based
on our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is: Myeloid cells sense endogenous inflammatory cues through
dectin-1 to mediate crosstalk between the immune system and CNS that promotes neuroprotection. This study
will contribute to a growing body of evidence that dectin-1 has importance beyond the context of fungal infection.
We advance this emerging understanding by identifying a new protective mechanism of Dectin-1, specifically in
the setting of CNS autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. This project will provoke consideration of dectin-1 and
its effector functions beyond the context of infection to provide potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention
in neuroinflammatory disorders."
10744183,"Project summary
 Hair cells of the inner ear are the primary receptors of the auditory system. They transduce mechanical
information, associated with sound waves, into electro-mechanical (outer hair cells) and electro-chemical (Inner
hair cells) signals, which lead to amplification of the initial signal and activation of afferent neuronal fibers,
respectively. While hair cells and neuronal fibers appear before birth in mice, development and maturation of
the hair cells, neurons and synapses proceeds until hearing onset, ~postnatal day 12. This process is believed to
be dynamic and modulated by hair cell activity. In particular, recent work has shown that lack of hair cell
transmission, due to absence of functional synapses or defective mechanosensation, leads to altered neuronal
maturation and specification. Successful outcomes for new therapies, including gene therapy, aimed at restoring
hair cell function after birth, may depend on restoration of auditory circuits, including mature and functional
hair cell synapses and neuronal fibers. Here we propose to assess how disruption or loss of sensory transduction
in several mouse models affects hair cell function, synaptic maturation and spiral ganglion specification.
Furthermore, we will determine if inner ear gene therapy is capable of reversing any of these observed changes
and identify the conditions for optimal recovery of auditory function. We will combine state-of-the-art
technologies to address these important questions, including high-resolution imaging, electrophysiology, single
cell RNA sequencing and localization of RNA transcripts."

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are among the top modifiable factors leading to premature death. Reducing this
burden will depend on a combination of changes in regulatory policy, preventive strategies, and treatment
strategies aimed at interrupting hazardous drinking and addiction. There creates a critical need to promote the
development of new investigators in alcohol research, and attract established investigators from other fields, to
further these goals. The Pilot Component identifies promising investigators and provides pilot funding,
mentoring, and collaboration with established alcohol investigators, with a goal of helping them accrue
preliminary data leading to success in obtaining larger grants. A secondary goal is to explore areas of long-
range relevance to the themes of the IARC. The flexibility inherent in a pilot project allows investigators to
respond rapidly to unique scientific opportunities as they arise."
10757918,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Binge drinking is a major contributor to the harms of alcohol use disorder (AUD), with high-intensity binge
intake being particularly hazardous. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) that drive front-loading
(strong initial intake rate) and sustained high drinking. Component 1 human results show that familial
history/density of AUD relates to shorter time to reach binge levels, suggestive a heritable risk for excessive
intake, but there is critical unmet need to understand mechanism(s) that drive excessive drinking. To
discover critical brain circuits that drive excessive intake with heritable risk, we use rat lines selected for high
alcohol consumption, P and HAD rats, which may model heritable AUD risk, and moderate-drinking Wistar rats
as controls. Importantly, P rats show greater behavioral responses involving stimulus salience and vigor, while
HAD rats have higher anxiety. Thus, these two lines may model reward versus relief drinking in AUD.
Excessive drinking is likely driven by the strong, salient motivational properties of alcohol, which implicates the
brain’s salience network (SN) which identifies and rapidly responds to important events. We focus on anterior
insula (aINS), a critical regulator of SN and many aspects of motivation- and emotion-driven behavior. Also,
aINS inhibition reduces rodent alcohol drinking, and human studies implicate aINS in both cue- and negative
affect-driven drive for alcohol. However, little is known about specific mechanism(s) whereby aINS
promotes front-loading and sustained high drinking. We specifically examine aINS projections to Nucleus
Accumbens core (NAcb) and Basolateral Amygdala (BLA), since NAcb has widely been linked to vigor and
reward-directed action, with BLA implicated in anxiety expression. Thus, we hypothesize that P rat drinking will
involve greater aINS-NAcb neuronal firing during drinking and greater reduction of consumption when inhibiting
aINS-NAcb (vs HAD and Wistar rats). In contrast, HADs will have higher aINS-BLA encoding of drinking and
greater reduction of intake when inhibiting aINS-BLA. Aim 1 looks for rat line differences in the anatomical size
of aINS-NAcb and aINS-BLA projections. Aim 2 uses cutting edge in vivo neuronal recording to discover firing
patterns during front-loading in aINS-NAcb and aINS-BLA neurons (identified by “opto-tagging,” light-based
stimulation to identify particular cells). We predict that greater aINS firing will correlate with higher front-loading,
especially aINS-BLA in HAD and aINS-NAcore in P rat. Before alcohol, we also examine aINS activity during
anxiety, sedation, and sucrose exposure, to determine whether aINS encoding of these states predicts
excessive intake level. Aim 3 uses projection-specific inhibition methods to specifically suppress aINS-NAcore
or aINS-BLA and test the hypothesis that excessive alcohol intake is more affected by aINS-NAcore inhibition
in P rats and aINS-BLA inhibition in HADs. Together, proposed studies have strong interactions and synergy
with other Components, and, if successful, the positive impact of our work will be the discovery of key aINS
mechanisms that drive front-loading and sustained high alcohol drinking, which would improve AUD treatment."
10757922,"Project Summary
 Alcohol use disorder is characterized by escalating alcohol intake over time, accompanied by development
of tolerance to alcohol’s reinforcing effects that may promote further increases in drinking. Binge and high-
intensity drinking (BHID) is a pattern of excessive drinking marked by both rapid alcohol intake and sustained
high alcohol consumption over time, but the role of reward tolerance in and the neurobiological causes of BHID
are unknown. C57BL/6J mice and the selectively bred crossed High Alcohol Preferring (cHAP) mice provide
ideal models to investigate the neural bases of BHID: C57BL/6J mice develop rapid, binge-like drinking in the
Drinking in the Dark paradigm, whereas cHAP steadily consume alcohol throughout the day under 2-bottle
choice (10% alcohol vs. water) access to achieve blood ethanol concentrations three times the legal driving
limit. Using these two mouse genotypes and their respective models of BHID, this project examines how BHID
alters alcohol motivation, measured as changes in alcohol seeking and taking in operant self-administration
and conditioned place preference. Additionally, neurocircuits that may underlie these shifts in behavior will be
investigated, centering on the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) as a terminal region that shows tolerance to alcohol
at the single neuron level after excessive alcohol intake in cHAP mice, particularly in females. This proposal
investigates whether increased DMS excitatory activity after drinking and the associated alcohol tolerance is
due to strengthening of inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), assessed using slice electrophysiology.
Centrality of potentiated BLA input to DMS for neuroadaptations to BHID, as well as involvement of this BLA-
DMS circuit in alcohol-motivated behaviors altered after BHID, will be investigated using chemogenetics to
manipulate circuit activity. Finally, cortical inputs to the BLA from the anterior insula and medial prefrontal
cortex will be tested for their ability to regulate the activity of BLA neurons that project to DMS and plasticity
following BHID. Together, these studies examine if BHID is associated with reward tolerance and examine one
putative neuroadaptive mechanism that may underlie this tolerance. By elucidating how BHID alters activity in
a disynaptic circuit terminating in the DMS, and how the BLA-DMS node of the circuit regulates alcohol
reinforcement and consumption, this project will provide knowledge about one putative source of BHID effects
on the brain and behavior. Given the sex differences in DMS adaptation to alcohol history, these studies may
also elucidate sex-specific mechanisms for neuroadaptations underlying excessive alcohol intake."

The Prevention Research Center (PRC), a division of Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), was
founded in October 1983 around the `Environmental Approaches to Prevention' Research Center grant, se-
lected following peer review as the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) national Cen-
ter for prevention research. The overall goals of the Center are to: (1) undertake innovative basic research that
informs the development and implementation of cost-effective environmental prevention policies and programs
at the organizational, local, state, and national levels; (2) undertake translational research of applied and prac-
tical importance, including implementation, efficacy, and effectiveness studies focused on interventions to pre-
vent alcohol-related problems, especially those addressing environmental factors; (3) summarize and synthe-
size new and existing knowledge about prevention theories, policies, and programs, and to disseminate this
information to professional, academic, and community audiences; and (4) provide multidisciplinary training and
research opportunities for post-doctoral fellows and other early investigators.
A key focus of the proposed Center Grant renewal is to investigate the potential of local alcohol control policies
and other prevention efforts to reduce neighborhood and community alcohol problems by changing the oppor-
tunity structures for drinking in ways that can effectively ameliorate harms. With an eye towards developing
novel context-related real-time interventions, we will investigate the social and situational conditions that affect
adolescents' and young adults' decisions regarding transitions in nighttime drinking contexts before and after
the legal drinking age, and corresponding changes in risks for heavy alcohol use and related consequences
(Component #3). We will investigate the combined influences over time of local alcohol and marijuana regula-
tory policies, enforcement activities, and retail alcohol and marijuana availability on alcohol and marijuana use,
co-use, and related problems during adolescence and early adulthood (Component #4). We will examine eth-
nic differences in alcohol and marijuana co-use and related problems in a prospective cohort study of young
adults, and the extent to which local alcohol and marijuana policies, enforcement, and illegal and legal mariju-
ana availability affect ethnic disparities over time (Component #5). We will examine alcohol use and related
harms during life transitions among older adults to help inform alcohol policies and other interventions relevant
to this growing, but understudied, population (Component #6). We will investigate mechanisms of policy effects
at the local level and address a critical gap in research on the physical availability of alcohol and alcohol-re-
lated problems by examining the role of alcohol sales from on- and off-premises outlets with 30 years of data
from the Western Australia Alcohol Indicators Database (WAAID) (Component #7). Finally, we will disseminate
our research findings and summaries to stakeholders in communities across the U.S. and obtain input to im-
prove the content, format, and use of this information (Component #2)."

 The Core component of the proposed renewal of the “Environmental Approaches to Prevention” Research
Center Grant at the Prevention Research Center (PRC) will perform organizing and administrative functions for
the entire center, supporting the infrastructure critical to the goals and aims of PRC for the period from
December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2027. The Core has coordinating responsibility over all Center Grant
research components, as well as other funded research projects not a part of the Center Grant. Ensuring and
maintaining scientific standards and raising public awareness are primary functions of the Core. Core
responsibilities are both internal (supporting Center Grant and PRC) and external (supporting alcohol
prevention in general).
 Major internal functions of the Core specifically related to the Center Grant include: Executive Function,
Administrative Support, Computer/ Statistical Support, and the Research Reference function. The Core will
support administrative time of the Principal Investigator (Dr. Mallie J. Paschall), while the Associate Director
(Dr. Paul J. Gruenewald) will provide administrative time as needed at no cost. The Core will also support two
policy analysts (Dr. Sue Thomas and Mr. Ryan Treffers) and two post-doctoral fellows who will be involved in
multiple research components of the Center. The Core will also provide financial support for meetings of the
Scientific Advisory Council. PRC and its parent organization, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation,
provide indirect support for information technology services, facilities management, and recruitment of
personnel, and computer/statistical support functions: word processing, graphic design capability, and
additional data management. The Research Reference function includes maintenance of the alcohol
prevention library.
 Alcohol prevention is multi-disciplinary, so the Center cannot function in isolation. PRC staff are involved in
a range of activities designed to create scientific bases for public discussions about alcohol issues and to
contribute to awareness and rational public debate. Therefore, the major external functions of the Core are to
support participation in scientific and professional meetings; conference sponsorship; consultation,
participation in advisory groups, expert panels or direct technical assistance; providing testimony; research
review; editorial review; professional associations; and training."

The successful translation and dissemination of findings from alcohol prevention research into community-
based practice is a key component of the Environmental Approaches to Prevention Center Grant. Over the
past four years, Center Grant and other PRC staff members have sought to increase the awareness, adoption,
and implementation of effective strategies to reduce alcohol problems by implementing a widespread social
media release strategy through the Resource Link for Community Action of PRC, which is part of PRC's
website. The Resource Link provides information and practical guidance to state and community agencies and
organizations, policymakers, and members of the public who are interested in preventing or reducing alcohol-
and other drug-related harms. We have also expanded the audience for Center Grant and related research
conducted by PRC and other scientists by using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
Although we have successfully broadcast findings from prevention research to a broad audience, key
questions remain about what types of informational content formats, delivered in what types of media
platforms, may be most useful to community-based governmental officials and advocates. Nor do we know the
extent to which they have noticed the information we have disseminated, much less how they may have used it
and with what audiences. For the next five-year Center Grant, and as informed by the implementation science
field, we propose an exploratory project to identify the most efficacious ways by which to translate our research
into practical and useful tools for community-based advocates and government officials. The specific aims of
this Information and Dissemination Component of the Center Grant are as follows: (1) Conduct discrete focus
groups with purposive samples of community-based (a) governmental officials (n=10) and (b) advocates
(n=10) to explore optimal content formats and social media platforms for the information we will disseminate
over the course of the next five years; (2) Using this input, develop a variety of policy-relevant informational
products that can be used by community-based advocates and local government officials nationwide; (3)
Conduct a media scan to identify a heterogeneous set of communities across the U.S. that have recently
experienced significant alcohol harm-related events, and identify key stakeholders in these communities who
are likely to have a substantial interest in identifying and implementing effective strategies to prevent further
harms; (4) In each of these communities, share our sample content formats and social media platforms to
determine which local stakeholders consider most useful; and (5) Assess stakeholders' receptivity to and
preferences for these various products and platforms, track whether and how they were used with which
audiences as well as how they were received, and disseminate findings from this project. We expect that these
activities will greatly enhance PRC's capabilities to successfully disseminate findings from studies conducted
as part of the Center Grant and from other alcohol prevention research at PRC."

Opportunities and constraints to drink in different contexts change when young people can access alcohol
legally, but also change momentarily across nighttime hours. We will investigate how contextual risks (e.g.,
drinking locations, number of people, other's drinking) across weekend evening hours change when young
people attain the legal drinking age and how they contribute to heavier drinking and alcohol-related problems.
Young people drink most often during weekend nighttime hours. Prior research has demonstrated that over
those hours drinking and problems may increase, and that drinking is associated with situational (e.g., alcohol
availability) and social (e.g., number of people, age composition) characteristics of drinking locations. The legal
drinking age is a life milestone that affects young people's drinking contexts, behaviors, and problems. Our
goal is to identify the contextual and personal characteristics (e.g., drinking motives) that contribute to drinking
risks over evening hours to inform nighttime preventive interventions for young people moving to the legal
drinking age. The specific aims are to: (1) measure changes in use of contexts and context-specific risks
before and after the legal drinking age, (2) assess differences in personal and contextual covariates related to
the use of nighttime drinking contexts and transitions between contexts among drinkers before and after the
legal drinking age, (3) determine the degree to which personal and contextual covariates differently increase
risks for heavier drinking and problems over evening hours before and after the legal drinking age, and (4)
evaluate the roles of evening plans on actual drinking and problems over evening hours. We propose a two-
wave Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) study with a sample of 300 young adult current drinkers in
California before they are of legal drinking age (19-20 years old) and two years later, after they attain legal
drinking age (21-22 years). A baseline and three 6-month follow-up surveys between EMA waves will be used
to assess and track changes in personal covariates (e.g., prior drinking, college attendance) and maintain a
high response rate. EMA is well suited to examining changes in contexts, opportunities, constraints, drinking
behaviors, and risks as they unfold in natural settings over evening hours because it minimizes recall bias,
maximizes ecological validity, and allows assessment of micro-ecological processes that influence behaviors
and risks in near real time. Our sample will include college and non-college young adult drinkers in different life
circumstances (e.g., living on their own or with parents) to capture the full range of drinking contexts and
opportunities of young adults as they move to legal drinking age. Results will inform context-based nighttime
preventive interventions by specifying when, where, and to whom prevention options should be provided."
10746797,"Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms that control metabolic homeostasis and there by identify therapies for metabolic diseases. While metabolic regulation is vital for an organism’s function and survival, metabolic dysregulation associated with insulin resistance gives rise to diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this project is to define the role of hepatic TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif) in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in normal and insulin resistant states. Proteins that regulate cell growth overlap with those that control metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, we determined whether TAZ, which is known to control proliferation, regulates hepatic metabolism. Using molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we obtained preliminary data which reveal that TAZ, independent of the Hippo pathway, is a unique regulator of energy homeostasis in the liver. Hepatic TAZ protein is dynamically altered by fasting and feeding, and TAZ regulates the differential expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes in response to fasting and feeding. However, in insulin resistant states, the dysregulation of TAZ leads to perturbations of both glucose and lipid homeostasis. To build on this preliminary work, we propose a series of molecular and mouse studies to delineate the molecular mechanisms whereby hepatic TAZ regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in physiologic and pathologic insulin resistant states. Our aims are listed below. Specific Aim 1 is to define the role of hepatic TAZ in the regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose homeostasis. Specific Aim 2 is to define the role of hepatic TAZ in the regulation of de novo lipogenic gene expression and triglyceride homeostasis. We expect that our studies will define a new role for TAZ in metabolic regulation and will identify molecular mechanisms whereby glucose and lipid homeostasis are physiologically regulated. We also expect that our studies will provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and thereby enable the development of therapies for insulin resistance-associated metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease."

OVERALL SUMMARY
The Cancer Genome Atlas and sister projects have now sequenced over 20,000 tumor genomes, providing a
catalog of gene mutations, copy number variants and other genetic alterations associated with cancer. These
data have made it clear that every cancer is a distinct genetic disease, with tumors that look physiologically
similar often driven by patterns of gene mutations that are strikingly different. Due to this molecular heterogeneity,
it is typically unclear what are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given cancer and how these
influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. One key observation for interpreting tumor genomes is that the
many rare tumor mutations can be shown to converge on common molecular networks. Based on this premise
we created the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), whose mission is to create comprehensive maps of cancer
molecular networks and to use these maps in intelligent systems for personalized therapy. In 2017, the CCMI
was funded as an NCI U54 Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology, integrating expertise in network
mapping, bioinformatic analysis and cancer research from leading academic laboratories at two University of
California campuses (UCSF and UCSD). We have since generated comprehensive networks of protein
interactions in breast and head-and-neck tumor cells and, from these data, identified several hundred protein
complexes under selective mutational pressure in cancer (NeST v1.0). We have piloted deep learning systems
(DCell, DrugCell and TCRP) that can use this protein network information to translate a patient’s tumor mutation
profile to a predicted drug response, including FDA-approved and exploratory agents. We have implemented a
rich portfolio of training opportunities and, leveraging UC institutional support, expanded the CCMI consortium
to include more than a dozen faculty at UC and, most recently, Stanford. In the next five years, the CCMI will
seek to: (1) Generate comprehensive protein interaction networks centered on key cancer driver genes in lung
squamous cells (in healthy and diseased states) as well as the PIK3CA and TP53 pathways, which are central
to many tumor types; (2) Systematically extend the CCMI collection of cancer protein interaction data with protein
immunofluorescent imaging and cryo-electron microscopy to formulate multi-scale cancer cell maps; (3) Dissect
the functional logic of these networks and maps by systematic genetic screening experiments in the same tumor
types and pathways, using a panel of scalable cell proliferation, phenotype and pathway readouts; (4)
Significantly advance and harden our DrugCell interpretable deep learning system for cancer precision medicine;
(5) Train the current and next generation of scientists in network biology and its applications to cancer research;
and (6) Continue to build a cadre of leading investigators to expand CCMI into a global coordinated partnership."

Over 2.2 million children aged 2–5 years have wheezing episodes that are severe enough to require Emergency
Department (ED) visits each year in the United States, and 15% of these children require hospitalization. There
is new evidence suggesting that harmful bacteria growing in the throat may play an important role in determining
which preschoolers will wheeze and then go on to develop asthma. Bacteria and viruses are equally associated
with the risk of acute episodes of wheezing in preschoolers, and antibiotics may be a potential treatment. Two
large, well-designed clinical trials performed in outpatient clinics recently showed a significant reduction in severe
symptoms when children were treated with the antibiotic Azithromycin (AZ) either before or after they started
wheezing. Though these results are encouraging, we are not sure how this benefit occurs since AZ has both
anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, we do not know if AZ could be effective in more severe
cases, like those requiring ED visits. The relatively underprivileged preschoolers who present to the ED for care
of their severe wheezing episodes are usually sicker and with greater risk factors for bacterial infections. They
are, therefore, the population that may get the greatest benefit, if AZ is shown to be effective in this setting. We
propose a trial in preschool age children coming to the ED with severe wheezing who will be treated with either
AZ or placebo. We will also determine which bacteria are growing in the children’s pharynx. This will answer the
question “Does Azithromycin make children with severe wheezing better sooner and, if so, is that benefit seen
in all the children treated or only in those with potentially harmful bacteria in their throats?” There is concern
that excessive use of antibiotics may cause bacterial resistance to their effects. We will thus determine if genetic
factors or the populations of microbes present in the pharynx can identify children that are more likely to respond
to AZ. This will allow us to target the use of AZ to these children in the future. By testing treatment of high risk
children with severe wheezing in the ED with AZ and determining which bacteria are growing in their throats, our
study may identify a new way to treat these severe, frightening, and difficult to treat illnesses."

Over 2.2 million children aged 2–5 years have wheezing episodes that are severe enough to require Emergency
Department (ED) visits each year in the United States, and 15% of these children require hospitalization. There
is new evidence suggesting that harmful bacteria growing in the throat may play an important role in determining
which preschoolers will wheeze and then go on to develop asthma. Bacteria and viruses are equally associated
with the risk of acute episodes of wheezing in preschoolers, and antibiotics may be a potential treatment. Two
large, well-designed clinical trials performed in outpatient clinics recently showed a signiﬁcant reduction in severe
symptoms when children were treated with the antibiotic Azithromycin (AZ) either before or after they started
wheezing. Though these results are encouraging, we are not sure how this beneﬁt occurs since AZ has both
anti-bacterial and anti-inﬂammatory effects. In addition, we do not know if AZ could be effective in more severe

10757890,"Project Summary/Abstract: Administrative Core
 The Administrative Core of the Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) provides leadership by coordinating
and optimizing the synergy of the interacting components and cores. The Administrative Core also provides
financial oversight and administrative support, and satisfies the critical need for the central management of a
complex budget spanning two schools at Indiana University (Medicine at IU and Science at IUPUI), their
different departments, and collaborations between Indiana University and Purdue University. The objective
and long-term goal of the Administrative Core is the smooth financial management of the grant budget as
proposed in this application, in addition to the coordination and integration of the scientific activities of the
participants and our collaborators. The rationale for including administrative support from Dr. Kareken’s office
in the Department of Neurology is to link the activities of the Center with the broader resources of Research
Administration and financial management support from Neuroscience Administration (program manager Tyler
Childress), where Neurology resides. The expected outcomes of the activities of this Core are the continued
excellence of the science and the coordinated, thematic, and collaborative activities of the Center. The aims of
the Administrative Core are therefore to: (1) Provide the scientific leadership, administrative support, and
ongoing annual financial oversight for the Indiana Alcohol Research Center. (2) (a) Assist in the identification,
recruitment, and development of new investigators in alcohol-related research, b) aid new investigators and
their applications for grants, c) help facilitate medical and graduate student exposure to alcohol research, and
d) maintain oversight of the web site to serve as a source of information for alcohol researchers, patients and
practitioners, and as a link to the Information Dissemination Core. (3) Provide leadership in organizing
seminars, conferences, and workshops, and in the dissemination of new research findings to the academic and
lay communities. (4) Foster collaborative research ventures between the IARC, other ARCs, and other
investigators both domestically and abroad."
10757905,"Project Summary
This renewal of the P60 Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) will identify the changes in brain activity that
predispose one to Binge and High Intensity Drinking (BHID). Towards this goal, the IARC will be collecting
large, dense data sets from humans and rodents with a range of techniques that acquire multiple,
simultaneous measures of neural function. This creates a critical need for an IARC service core that provide
expertise in network analysis and computational modeling to the center’s research components. The goal of
the NACM is to interrogate the brain networks and neural circuits that underlie BHID in a translational manner.
The objective of the NCAM is to therefore increase synergy and translation across species and components,
and to integrate the center’s data into computational models capable of articulating the pathology in neural
circuits that underlie BHID. The NACM will work closely with the research components to implement and
develop analyses and computational modeling techniques that capture network and systems-level interactions.
Accomplishing this will provide added rigor and more integrated, synergistic conclusions generated by IARC
components. Thus, the NCAM will provide advanced, targeted analyses and computational models that
increase synergy among the components. This will disseminate current IARC expertise in statistical analyses
and computational modeling to the center more broadly. As a core, the NACM does not set out to test specific
hypotheses, but rather, to work closely with the research components to add rigor and synergy. This allows
each component to assess their hypotheses more effectively, with the long-term goal of providing more
integrated model of the mechanisms of BHID. This will be accomplished in three Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Identify altered, potentially translational, network functions in BHID in humans and rodents.
Specific Aim 2: Apply population analysis and artificial intelligence-based approaches to identify altered
computations in BHID to human and rodent data.
Specific Aim 3: Build computational models of corticolimbic systems altered in BHID.
The positive impact of the NACM will be to provide insight into how computations performed by brain networks
are altered in those at risk for BHID and AUD. Understanding this will inspire novel approaches to treatment
that more tightly link heritable changes in neural circuit function to BHID."
10758235,"ABSTRACT
A growing number of states have legalized marijuana for medical and recreational use, which may increase the
likelihood of concurrent or simultaneous use (co-use) with alcohol. Co-use of alcohol and marijuana may
exacerbate problems associated with their use, including impaired driving, poor academic performance,
aggression, and increased risk of substance use disorder. Regulatory policies and their enforcement may
affect alcohol and marijuana use and co-use directly by deterring use or indirectly by influencing commercial
and social availability, opportunities for use, beliefs about risks, and norms. Although we know a great deal
about state-level alcohol policies, we know less about local policies, and little or no research has examined
both local alcohol and marijuana policies and the extent to which they may jointly influence alcohol and
marijuana use, co-use, and problems over time. Given the substantial variation in how alcohol and marijuana
policies are implemented and enforced at the local level, and the rapidly changing marijuana policy
environment, this is a serious gap in our knowledge of how to effectively regulate these substances to minimize
problems. Moreover, little is known about how young people adapt to local regulatory policies and enforcement
activities that place constraints on availability and opportunities for using alcohol and marijuana and risks
associated with such adaptations. Alcohol and drug policies and enforcement may have differential effects
across gender, sexual, and racial/ethnic groups, potentially contributing to health disparities. To address these
issues, we propose a five-year study to investigate whether more restrictive evidence-based local policies and
stronger enforcement reduce alcohol and marijuana availability and opportunities for use, and prevent alcohol
and marijuana use, co-use, and related problems during adolescence and in early adulthood. The study will be
conducted in 40 California cities that vary in alcohol and marijuana regulatory policies and retail availability. We
will monitor changes in marijuana and alcohol policies, enforcement activities, and marijuana and alcohol retail
availability over a three-year period. We will conduct a three-wave longitudinal survey with a cohort of 1,000 15
to 20-year-olds recruited in the 40 cities to assess their alcohol and marijuana use and co-use in different
contexts, related problems, sources and types of marijuana and alcohol used, and related beliefs. This study
will (a) determine whether more restrictive local regulatory policies and enforcement activities delay initiation of
alcohol and marijuana use and co-use and prevent escalation of these behaviors and problems over time; (b)
ascertain the extent to which such effects are mediated through availability (social, commercial, and illicit),
opportunities and constraints for alcohol and marijuana use, and related beliefs; (c) provide guidance to
policymakers and public health stakeholders at local levels; and (d) inform future research on local alcohol and
marijuana alcohol policies and mechanisms through which they may affect alcohol and marijuana use. We will
also explore the extent to which race/ethnicity, sex, and gender moderate effects of policy and enforcement."

 The 2016 legalization of recreational cannabis in California created a legal growth, distribution, sales, and
taxation system, which is still going through an implementation process dependent on local policy options.
Presently, there is considerable local variation in cannabis policies, along with legal retail availability and illegal
trafficking throughout the state. This 5-year component of the Center will leverage these unique varying
community contexts to examine the associations between local alcohol and cannabis control policies, alcohol
and cannabis co-use and related problems among non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics. In 2018, these two
groups together comprised 76% of the population in California. The study will be the first to investigate how
the local policy and retail environment (and the illegal cannabis market) contribute to or possibly ameliorate
ethnic disparities in alcohol and cannabis use and related harms with longitudinal analyses of survey data.
Existing evidence indicates overlap in the use of these two substances. For instance, 64% of adults who used
cannabis in the past year, used alcohol in the past month or used alcohol heavily in the past month. Co-use of
these two substances, especially simultaneous use, has been associated with a higher rate of personal and
social problems. Concurrent users are 2 times more likely than alcohol-only users to report social problems
from use, while simultaneous users are almost 3 times more likely than alcohol-only users to report problems
and harms to self. Survey data will be collected over the phone and online from 18-39 year old Whites and
Hispanics in years 1, 2, and 3 (T1, T2, T3) of the project (N=1,200) in 40 cities that vary in alcohol and
cannabis policies and retail availability. The specific aims are: 1) examine the associations between local
regulatory policies, enforcement activities, proximity, and daily exposure to licensed alcohol and cannabis
outlets, and illegal cannabis sources; 2) examine the associations between increased exposure to both legal
(alcohol and cannabis outlets) and illegal cannabis markets and patterns of use, co-use, and associated
problems; 3) examine contexts of alcohol and cannabis use and co-use, variation in types of cannabis use
(e.g., smoke, vape, edible) and co-use by contexts, and the association of contexts and types of use and
problems; 4) investigate T1 to T3 changes in local policy, policy enforcement and alcohol and cannabis retail
availability and T1 to T3 changes (increase, decrease, incidence, stability, cessation) in alcohol and cannabis
co-use."
11177334,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an enigmatic and morbid disease where insights are emerging
regarding genetic susceptibility to disease. Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with PAH risk and severity. Yet, the GWAS-reported SNPs
are only tags of haplotype SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Thus, the tag SNP may simply be linked to the
true disease-causing functional SNP (fSNP). GWAS also only reveal statistical associations, and it has been
challenging to define the mechanisms underlying the contribution of the PAH-associated fSNPs, which are
mostly located in the non-coding regions, to the pathogenesis of PAH. Using our recently developed post-GWAS
functional genomics platform, I identified a non-coding fSNP rs4738801 in the genomic locus of SOX17 gene, a
known endothelial effector increasingly being studied in PAH pathogenesis. I identified that the transcription
factor FUBP1 binds to the rs4738801 risk allele C in an allele-imbalanced manner, with lower affinity to risk allele
C than non-risk allele G, providing an underlying mechanism how this fSNP regulates the PAH pathogenic gene
SOX17 and contributes to the PAH risk. FUBP1 controls PAH-associated pathophenotypes in pulmonary arterial
endothelial cells (PAECs). Downregulated by the major acquired PAH trigger hypoxia, FUBP1 and its target
gene SOX17 are decreased in lungs and isolated pulmonary ECs from PAH patients and mouse models. A 3.77-
fold enrichment of fSNP rs4738801 risk allele C was found in patients with PAH induced by hypoxia, supporting
a pathogenic mechanism of a hypoxia-sensitive pathway (FUBP1-SOX17) combined with a disease susceptible
genotype (risk allele C) for clinical manifestation of this disease. Based on these data, I hypothesize that the
allele-imbalanced binding of transcription factor FUBP1 to fSNP rs4738801 defines the genomic architecture
contributing to the SOX17-dependent genetic susceptibility of PAH. I further postulate that the downregulation
of FUBP1-SOX17 by hypoxia contributes to the acquired pathogenesis of PAH. To test this hypothesis, I propose
2 specific aims: 1) To define the allele-specific role of fSNP rs4738801 in promoting endothelial dysfunction in
PAH in gene-edited iPSC-ECs and PAH patient lung tissues; and 2) To determine the role of FUBP1 in controlling
SOX17 and PAH in mouse models. Accomplishing these aims will facilitate my enduing career goal of becoming
an independent physician-scientist in PAH functional genomics research. Immediate scientific development
objectives include: 1) To develop expertise in PAH genetics and functional genomics; 2) To develop expertise in
iPSC-EC biology and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing techniques; and 3) To develop skills of in vivo gene expression
manipulation and become proficient in the assessment of PAH in animal models. The proposed training plan will
provide me with the opportunity to expand my knowledge base to include advanced research techniques in PAH
pathogenesis. The resources and expertise of my mentors, contributors, and the rich research environment at
the University of Pittsburgh will assure my successful transition to an independent investigator."
10877725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, a record 71,000 opioid overdose deaths occurred in the U.S. The number of such deaths can be
reduced by buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone, the three FDA-approved
medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Despite this, many patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) never
initiate treatment with MOUD, and those that do often drop out of treatment, increasing their risk of death.
Although the uninsured are over-represented among patients with OUD, privately insured and Medicaid
patients represent three-quarters of non-elderly Americans with OUD, suggesting that mitigating barriers to
MOUD use in these patients is an especially important goal. Among the many such barriers, insurance-related
barriers are an appealing target for intervention, as insurance benefit design is directly under the control of
policymakers, insurers, and employers. However, the effects of insurance-related barriers on MOUD use in
privately insured and Medicaid patients have not been rigorously studied. Consequently, it is unclear which
barriers should be targeted in policy interventions and how these interventions should be designed. In this
proposal, we will provide actionable, policy-relevant information on the effect of cost-sharing for MOUD in
privately insured patients and on the effect of removing prior authorization requirements for MOUD in Medicaid
patients. To do so, we will analyze 2017-2023 data from several state-of-the-art national databases, including
prescription dispensing data from 92% of U.S. pharmacies, a pharmacy transactions database capturing 63%
of U.S. prescription volume, commercial claims from 55 million Americans, and 100% Medicaid claims from all
states. Analyses will focus on patients aged 15-64 years, an age group accounting for 96% of U.S. opioid
overdose deaths. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the association between cost-sharing and the risk of MOUD
prescription non-dispensing in privately insured patients, both overall and among key patient subgroups, such
as those initiating MOUD therapy. Additionally, we will use the commercial claims database to evaluate the
association between cost-sharing for MOUD and opioid overdose risk in privately insured patients. In Aim 2,
we will use difference-in-differences models, national pharmacy databases, and Medicaid claims to evaluate
whether state policies eliminating prior authorization requirements for MOUD in Medicaid plans were
associated with changes in MOUD dispensing, retention in MOUD therapy, and opioid overdose risk in
Medicaid patients. Findings from this proposal will inform and spur efforts to optimize insurance benefit design
for MOUD in private and Medicaid plans, potentially leading to the removal of insurance-related barriers that
may be contributing to rising opioid-related morbidity and mortality."

been led since 2015 by Dr. Grinspoon, HMS Professor of Medicine, Chief of the MGH Metabolism Unit and
Endowed Chair in Neuroendocrinology and Metabolism. Over the past 5 years, under Dr. Grinspoon’s
leadership, and with the able help of a dedicated Executive Committee (EC), and strong external Advisory
Board (EAB), the focus of the Center has expanded to include a rich network of collaborating scientists
performing translational studies in metabolism, utilizing advanced imaging, ‘omics, and metabolic phenotyping
techniques, with 119 active investigators in the research base (comprised of 88 Full and 31 Associate
Members). The Research Base of the NORC-H is comprised of faculty from HMS and Harvard Chan School of
Public Health, as well as physician-scientists and PhDs/ScDs working at Harvard-affiliate hospitals
representing a large and vibrant research community. The research base is carefully evaluated by the Director
and the EC, as well as the EAB, with removal of members not participating in Center activities or pursuing
funded research in the nutrition and obesity space. Overall, the current application reflects the growing base of
members, increasing 18% over the last cycle through a purposeful focus on increasing our base of early career
investigators (Associate Members). Our goal is to promote and retain this pipeline of younger, successful
researchers with a focus on obesity, nutrition and metabolism at Harvard. The NORC-H now includes 31
Associate Members (up from 12 in the prior cycle). The strong base of 31 Associate Members, consisting of
post-doctoral fellows, Instructors and Assistant Professors who continue with mentored research, is comprised
of 18 individuals with early career development K funding. Of our 88 full members, 80 have relevant PI/MPI
grant support (Table A), 58 (66%) are PI/MPI of at least one R01, and 43(49%) are PI of funding from NIDDK.
The Center’s thematic focus has sharpened over the past cycle to further assess translational mechanisms
and consequences of nutritional and weight-related metabolic diseases across the lifespan, with 4 focused
themes, including: 1) Appetite Regulation, Gut Physiology and Nutrient Absorption, 2) Social and
Environmental Determinants of Nutrition and Metabolism, 3) Genetic, Cellular and Immunological Mechanisms,
and 4) End Organ Consequences and Obesity related Care. These thematic areas are facilitated by three
strong cores, Metabolic Imaging (MI), Metabolic Phenotyping (MP) and Genomics and Cell Biology (GCB),
which have continued to grow and offer new cutting-edge services, as well as a robust Administrative Core
which coordinates NORC-H services and activities. Strong success of our research base is evident through 1)
securing nutrition and obesity related grants, 2) publishing papers, with 618 related publications this cycle, 527
(85%) of which cite the grant, and 3) expanding core use with 102 identified users, publishing 249 papers."

 Significant trends in demographic and lifestyle characteristics of older adults give reason to look more
closely at alcohol consumption and subsequent harms among this group. The proportion of older adults is
growing rapidly, their life expectancy is greater than previous cohorts, and they are more likely to use alcohol
and other drugs than their predecessors. This study will identify key individual and environmental influences in
the course of aging through three annual surveys of adults aged 60 to 85 years of age in the state of California.
The guiding conceptual model gives attention to factors of alcohol availability (e.g., income, routine activities,
living situation) as well as individual characteristics, most notably physical and mental health. The study of
alcohol consumption among this cohort in the general population is rare.
 The study aims include describing patterns and volume of alcohol consumption, how specific drinking
contexts and situations influence drinking, and how changes in life experiences may result in subsequent
changes in alcohol use, whether increasing, decreasing or maintaining levels of consumption. Findings from
this study are expected to inform older adults, physicians, and managers of venues that cater to older adults
(e.g., retirement communities, recreational activities for seniors)."

 This component application addresses the question: How does the physical availability of alcohol affect
alcohol sales and related problems? Along with lower beverage prices, alcohol researchers have identified
greater physical availability of alcohol through retail alcohol outlets as a population health risk. However, since
alcohol sales data at the local level, within community areas, are rarely available, the mediating impacts of
sales in the availability  sales  problem causal sequence are not identified and likely confounded with other
economic and physical availability effects. Among these, most prominent are routine activities related to
purchases and consumption of alcohol at retail outlets that affect problems independent of sales (e.g.,
crowding at bars). Although measured at the state level in the US for many years, alcohol sales are not
typically measured at the local level. Local alcohol sales data provide the opportunity to distinguish effects of
sales from other activities that affect problems. In turn, findings about these relationships can direct local
regulation at characteristics of outlets that affect problems (e.g., crowding) vs characteristics of outlets that
affect sales (e.g., drink specials). The primary regulatory consequence of the unavailability of local sales data
is to make it very difficult for community planners and public health practitioners to advocate for appropriate
local availability controls.
 The proposed studies will strengthen our understanding of these relationships using postcode data from
the Western Australia Alcohol Indicators Database (WAAID; 1991-2020), an Australian state with an alcohol
retail licensing system and socioeconomic conditions similar to states in the US. WAAID enables us to:
 (1) Measure the extent to which the physical availability of alcohol (i.e., concentration of different types of
 alcohol outlets) within neighborhoods and communities affects sales, and
 (2) Distinguish the degree to which concentrations of alcohol outlets per se, independent of sales made
 through those outlets, are associated with alcohol related problems.
 The proposed work is ambitious but feasible, relying upon theoretical and empirical achievements in
availability studies over the past 40 years, a systematic approach to spatial analysis models of availability
effects, and the historically deep skills and experiences of the project team. Critically, the project geographic
information system (GIS) has been developed and fully supported by our collaborators at the National Drug
Research Institute (NDRI), Curtin University, Western Australia. Analysis activities can begin upon onset of the
project."
10744732,"Invasion is one of the most detrimental features of all cancers, including breast cancer, as it allows cells to
escape the primary site and form metastases at distant organs. Despite progress in prevention and early
lesions detection, the mortality associated with metastatic breast cancer is still extremely high. This is
especially true for patients presenting with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, characterized by lack of
expression of ER, PR, and Her2 ), which is the most aggressive and deadliest subtype of breast cancer and
the one that so far lack specific targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisms that
facilitate the invasion of tumor cells will enable us to design more efficient therapeutic strategies to prevent or
reduce metastasis.
Our group has established a fundamental connection between GTP metabolism and tumor cell invasiveness;
we have unveiled GTP and its metabolic enzymes (GME) as key players in tumor progression and metastatic
potential. We have developed unique fluorescent reporters for intracellular GTP that have allowed us to
determine that, in live cells, the intracellular GTP distribution is not uniform, and brought forward the hypothesis
that local concentration of GTP can influence GTP-dependent processes. In particular, we have previously
shown that genetic or pharmacological modulation of the GTP metabolic pathway deeply affected the
activation status of small GTPases of the RHO-family and, with it, the tumor cells' invasive capability. Thus, in
Aim 1 we will explore a novel mechanism of G-proteins activation based on GME subcellular localization.
Our preliminary results showed that the rate-limiting enzyme for GTP de novo production, inositol
monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) enriches at cell membrane sites that are critical for cell migration
and invasion (namely focal adhesion, FA, and invadopodia). The role of IMPDH2 at these sites is virtually
uncharacterized. Thus, in Aim 2 we will assess the catalytic and structural role of IMPDH2 in FA and
invadopodia formation, as well as in focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-directed oncogenic motility.
The understanding of GTP metabolic enzymes transcriptional regulation is far from complete. Identification of
transcriptional master regulators of the GTP biosynthetic pathway that could be pharmacologically targeted
would offer a more efficient way of suppressing this pathway. Our preliminary results suggest that Kruppel-like
factor 9 (KLF9) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) play antagonistic roles in the transcriptional regulation of
GTP metabolic enzymes, with KLF9 suppressing, whereas AHR inducing GTP production. Thus, in Aim 3 we
will elucidate this regulation and explore pharmacological treatments to regulate the activity of these
transcription factors."

Epilepsy is a chronic and debilitating disease, leading to refractory seizures in up to 40% of patients. A
better understanding of the neural mechanisms that cause recurrent seizures could lead to improved
diagnostic markers and new neuroprotective therapies.
 My recent research suggests that abnormal slow-wave activity (SWA) patterns during sleep may
constitute a promising diagnostic marker to locate the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In a high-density
electroencephalogram (hdEEG) study of fifteen focal epilepsy patients, I found increases in sleep SWA
that were maximal in the SOZ and were correlated with seizure and interictal spike frequency. Building
on a wealth of studies validating sleep SWA as a marker of synaptic strength, my results suggest that
seizures and spikes induce synaptic potentiation in the human brain.
 To further validate sleep SWA as a diagnostic marker for the SOZ, I aim to make use of the higher
spatio-temporal resolution of direct intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In Aim 1, I will analyze
continuous iEEG recordings in patients with focal epilepsy to quantify sleep SWA in the SOZ, in the
seizure propagation network (SPN, areas secondarily recruited in the ictal rhythm), and in the periphery
(areas not involved in the ictal rhythm). I hypothesize that 1) in the SOZ, SWA will increase maximally;
2) in the periphery, sleep SWA will have lower values; and 3) the SPN will show intermediate patterns.
 In Aim 2, I will also analyze single-unit (SU) recordings to identify the neuronal contributors to sleep
SWA during sleep and their alterations across seizure territories. I will use existing long-term
microelectrode recordings from epileptic patients to quantify SU firing rates and multi-unit activity (MUA)
synchrony during sleep (two markers of synaptic strength) in the SOZ, the SPN, and the periphery. To
shed light on the relationship between increased sleep SWA and ictal firing rates, I will use the SU
recordings to separate the SPN into areas of high vs. low ictal firing rates (the ictal core vs. ictal
penumbra, respectively). I hypothesize that 1) in the SOZ, SU firing rates and MUA synchrony will
increase maximally; 2) in the periphery, SU firing rates and MUA synchrony will show lower values; and
3) the SPN will show intermediate patterns, but with more normal values overall in the ictal penumbra
compared to the ictal core.
 If this project is successful, it will provide mechanistic evidence for a link between chronic
hyperexcitability in the epileptic network and synaptic potentiation due to seizures, which can be
sensitively detected using intracranial sleep EEG. It will also allow researchers and clinicians to develop
new diagnostic tools to localize the SOZ, paving the way for new therapeutic interventions targeting
sleep to decrease seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy."
10738266,"Enzalutamide and abiraterone are initially effective for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). However, resistance to both drugs occurs frequently through mechanisms which are incompletely
understood. Evidence from both clinical and experimental studies demonstrate that Wnt signaling, particularly
through Wnt5A, plays vital roles in promoting CRPC progression and induction of resistance to enzalutamide
and abiraterone. Development of novel strategies targeting Wnt5A to overcome resistance is an urgent need.
Preliminary and clinical data demonstrate that Wnt5A signaling is significantly activated in resistant CRPC cells
and specimens from CRPC patients. Down regulation of Wnt5A inhibits AR/AR variants expression, suppresses
cell growth, and resensitizes resistant cells to anti-androgen treatment. The objective of this proposal is to fully
delineate the role of Wnt5A signaling in drug resistance and determine the efficacy of targeting Wnt5A using two
novel strategies to overcome resistance. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of Wnt5A in the development of
resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. In aim 2, we will evaluate the efficacy of two novel strategies
targeting Wnt5A for inhibiting resistant CRPC tumor growth and re-sensitization to enzalutamide/abiraterone
treatment. In aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanisms of action by Wnt5A inhibition in resistant CRPC. We hope
that by completion of this study we will provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat advanced CRPC through
targeting Wnt5A. We also expect that targeting Wnt5A in conjunction with enzalutamide/abiraterone therapy will
increase the magnitude and duration of the benefits of second-generation antiandrogens."
10758586,"The overall goal of the Information Dissemination Core of the UNC Alcohol Research Center is to disseminate
current research on alcohol drinking in youth and adults to key stakeholders in the broader community. We will
accomplish these aims by leveraging established and new partnerships with state agencies, local science

neurobiological consequences of adolescent binge drinking to local and regional stakeholders. Our target groups
are parents and community members across the state of North Carolina. We also target college students who
are at risk for alcohol-related harm and high school students, with the goal of binge drinking prevention. In Aim
2, we will coordinate bidirectional, translational education with fellows in the UNC Addiction Medicine Fellowship
and postdocs and other trainees in the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies (BCAS). This facilitated interaction
between addiction clinicians and basic scientists will benefit the training of both groups and synergizes with the
translational research supported in the UNC Alcohol Research Center. In Aim 3, we will train BCAS scientists in
community outreach and dissemination of scientific information. This includes the development of interactive
learning modules around neuroscience concepts and training BCAS scientists to engage children and families
with these modules to promote scientific literacy and enthusiasm. We will also maintain a website with resources
for families and educators, including those resources developed over the years by this Core. We will track metrics
of success for each of these activities, both to evaluate their effectiveness and to improve our approach.
Collaborative partnerships for the dissemination of scientific insight on alcohol drinking across the lifespan, with
an emphasis on adolescence, optimize our impact on public knowledge and health."

Research Component 1. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a multiphasic neural and behavioral pathology that is
characterized, in part, by dependence-induced escalated alcohol use. Robust prior work shows that synaptic
activity of calcium permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) is a target of alcohol that mediates the positive
reinforcing effects of the drug via activity within the brain reward pathway. Despite this progress in understanding
the molecular mechanisms of AUD, the role of CP-AMPAR activity in dependence-induced escalated alcohol
self-administration remains to be fully elucidated. Strong preliminary data show that alcohol dependence both
escalates the reinforcing effects of alcohol, as measured by operant self-administration, and upregulates AMPAR
expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and other brain regions that send glutamatergic projections to the
nucleus accumbens (Acb), a central component of the reward pathway. This convergence of molecular,
physiological, and behavioral data supports the overall hypothesis that: CP-AMPAR expression and activity in
the BLAAcb pathway is a target of alcohol dependence that, in turn, drives escalated alcohol self-
administration. We propose to test this hypothesis in three separate but integrated aims using male and female
C57Bl/6J mice. First, an integrated set of molecular and electrophysiology studies will evaluate the impact of
alcohol dependence, induced by the well-characterized chronic intermittent ethanol vapor (CIE-v) method, on
AMPAR subunit expression and CP-AMPAR synaptic activity within the BLAAcb pathway. Second, loss of
function behavioral studies will evaluate mechanistic regulation of dependence-induced escalated operant
alcohol self-administration by CP-AMPARs in the BLA, and by GluA1-containing AMPARs in BLA neurons that
project to the Acb using an innovative CRISPR/Cas9 method for specifically deleting the GluA1 subunit in this
pathway. Third, based on strong preliminary data, we will conduct multi-channel fiber photometry to assess the
impact of alcohol dependence on calcium signaling in genetically tagged excitatory and inhibitory cells during
escalated operant alcohol self-administration. The mechanistic role of upregulated calcium signaling in escalated
operant alcohol self-administration will be evaluated by inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
II (CaMKII) in the BLA, which is required for CP-AMPAR activity. These groundbreaking studies will move the
field forward in understanding how calcium-dependent glutamatergic mechanisms in the BLAAcb circuit
regulate the escalated reinforcing effects of alcohol associated with AUD."

The induction of pro-inflammatory signaling is a key pathologic feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD). This
includes increased expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling systems as well as activation of a variety of
proinflammatory cytokines. Since many TLRs are involved in AUD pathology, it is important to study downstream
mediators that are shared by multiple TLRs, in circuits that regulate AUD-related behaviors. Therefore, it is
important that we find we find that agonists to TLR3 and 7 as well as chronic ethanol exposure all result in robust
downstream induction of the proinflammatory transcription factor interferon regulator factor-7 (IRF7) in the
anterior insular cortex (aIC) and nucleus accumbens core (AcbC). This induction in these brain regions is relevant
as our work implicates aIC→AcbC circuitry as critical in the maintenance of alcohol self-administration.
Interestingly, IRF7 was primarily localized in neurons along with pro-inflammatory activation of microglia.
Microglia are key initiators of inflammatory signaling in brain and are capable of promoting neuronal and circuit
adaptations to ethanol. Microglial pro-inflammatory cytokines further alter neuronal excitatory/inhibitory (E/I)
balance – an overall theme of the UNC Alcohol Research Center (ARC) – as well as functional connectivity.
Therefore, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory microglia in aIC promote neuronal IRF7 and subsequent
excitatory outflow from the aIC to AcbC to promote alcohol self-administration. The overall hypothesis of the
present project is that neuronal IRF7 induction and pro-inflammatory microglial activation as a consequence of
alcohol vapor exposure together alter E/I balance across aIC→Acb circuitry to promote increases in alcohol self-
administration. Experiments in Aim 1 assess IRF7 signaling in aIC projection neurons and determine if IRF7
promotes escalations in alcohol self-administration following alcohol vapor exposure. Experiments in Aim 2 will
examine proinflammatory microglia signaling in the aIC including E/I balance using gene expression analyses
and determine the functional role of aIC proinflammatory microglia in vapor-induced increases in alcohol self-
administration. Lastly, the collaborative studies in Aim 3 will directly determine the effects of the alcohol vapor
exposure on the activity of aIC→Acb projection neurons using electrophysiology in collaboration with Research
Component 1 and investigate the role of microglia on brain-wide connectivity across binge ethanol models using
resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) in collaboration with Research Components 3 and 4 and the Scientific Resource Core. The
overall goal of the UNC ARC is to increase understanding of molecular and cellular pathogenesis in alcohol use
disorder. To this end, the studies in Research Component 2 will determine the molecular consequences of
chronic high-dose alcohol exposure via vapor exposure on IRF7 signaling and microglial activation and how
these changes promote subsequent escalations in alcohol self-administration."
10758596,"Project Summary/Abstract
High risk, binge-level drinking accounts for most alcohol-related harm. Binge drinking often begins in
adolescence when the brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol insult, resulting in persistently atypical
neurocognitive function. For example, we found that a history of adolescent binge drinking in adult people and
adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in adult rats associates with less behavioral flexibility, which
describes an individual’s ability to adjust their behavior to changing environmental circumstances. These
behavioral effects are associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity among prefrontal and
subcortical control circuits. Mechanistic links between adolescent alcohol exposure and reduced behavioral
flexibility remain unclear, but several lines of evidence suggest a shift in the balance between excitation and
inhibition [excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance], towards hyperexcitability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) together
with a weakening of top-down output from the PFC. Indeed, this proposal stems from our preliminary data in
humans and rats that AIE and/or current binge drinking alters metrics of E/I balance measured via magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and EEG in humans and neurochemical and electrophysiological measures in
rats. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that adolescent binge alcohol promotes a shift in the balance between
excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling within control circuits that has the net effect of reducing PFC output,
which in turn mediates more habitual action selection and greater vulnerability to alcohol insult in adulthood.
We further hypothesize that these AIE-induced E/I balance shifts are associated with altered functional
connectivity (humans) and neurochemistry (rats) of control hubs, including the dorsolateral PFC (or analogous
rodent prelimbic cortex) and anterior insula. To test this hypothesis, we will study rat and human subjects with
or without a history of adolescent and/or current binge drinking (or binge exposure in rats) and assess
behavioral flexibility in tasks that require adaptation to changes in response contingency. In human subjects,
we will use MRS and EEG techniques to assess indices of E/I balance, and MRI to measure functional
connectivity. In addition, we will measure whether changes in these measures mediate the effects of
transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of PFC on behavioral flexibility. In rats, we will use
neurochemical and electrophysiological approaches to assess indices of E/I balance, and manipulate them via
chemogenetic tools. This work may ultimately identify therapeutic targets differentiated by adolescent alcohol
history and thus improve AUD treatment efficacy. Additionally, we propose a set of complementary studies that
will extend this work and build on collaborations across the Alcohol Research Center. This explicitly
translational approach allows the human and rodent findings to mutually inform each other and advances the
translation of basic science to clinical application."
10758597,"Sex specificity of corticolimbic circuit activity and anxiety-like behavior after alcohol exposure
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex clinical condition that is commonly associated with other psychiatric
conditions like anxiety and depression. Despite significant differences in the prevalence and experience of AUD
in men and women, few studies have examined the neurobiological mechanisms underlying sex-specific effects
of alcohol on specific brain regions. The prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) and central amygdala (CeA) have been
implicated in both anxiety and alcohol dependence. Our previous work revealed sex-specific differences in PrL
and CeA activity and anxiety-like behavior following chronic ethanol exposure. Alcohol is acutely anxiolytic, but
prolonged exposure produces an anxiogenic phenotype, particularly in withdrawal. The impact of basal anxiety
levels in sex-specific alcohol sensitivity in PrL and CeA and the role of PrL→CeA in sex differences in anxiety-
like behavior following chronic alcohol exposure remains unknown and offers a potential target for improved
understanding of AUD. Preclinical and emerging clinical evidence indicate that the neurosteroid
allopregnanolone may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AUDs via actions on GABAA
receptor-mediated inhibitory control. As our previous work demonstrated sex-specific adaptations in inhibitory
control in PrL and CeA, we will also investigate the impact of allopregnanolone on ethanol-induced dysregulation.
We will employ an integrated molecular, cellular electrophysiological, and whole-animal imaging approach to
rigorously examine sex differences in PrL, CeA, and Pr→CeA circuitry and any sex-specific effects in synaptic
transmission, E/I balance, and network activity following chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal. We will also
assess the impact of allopregnanolone on any sex-specific changes following chronic ethanol exposure as a
potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AUD. The results of these studies will provide important
information on sex differences in the activity of PFC and CeA circuits and anxiety-like behavior and
uncover the potential effects of a pharmacological approach to reverse specific circuit dysfunction
following chronic ethanol exposure."
10758601,"Project Summary/Abstract
Excessive ethanol consumption is a major public health issue that can drive a range of serious health problems.
There are multiple mechanisms that contribute to the motivation to consume ethanol, and it has been shown that
ethanol has both aversive and rewarding properties. Considerable attention has been paid to the reinforcing
effects of ethanol and how these effects motivate ethanol intake. However, another factor that contributes to the
motivation to consume ethanol is the sensitivity to the aversive effects. It has been hypothesized that tolerance
to the aversive properties of ethanol contributes to excessive intake. One pre-clinical behavioral assay for the
aversive effects of ethanol is the development of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). When a taste is paired with
a treatment which produces aversive internal symptoms, a strong aversion to the taste develops. Studies
comparing different rodent strains suggest a link between sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol and the
propensity to voluntarily ingest ethanol. Importantly, it has been shown that as a dependence-like state emerges
in mice, sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol also declines as measured by CTA. This would suggest that
the tolerance to the aversive effects of ethanol that emerges with dependence may be another factor that drives
dependence-induced ethanol drinking. Because the neurocircuitry underlying the aversive effects of ethanol is
still poorly understood, we propose to combine cutting-edge tools to characterize the neurocircuit and molecular
mechanisms that regulate tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol. Based on previous studies and
compelling pilot data, we will test the hypothesis that aversive properties of ethanol are encoded in the insular
cortex (aIC) and that chronic ethanol disrupts excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the aIC, disrupting the
aversive properties of ethanol, contributing to escalated ethanol consumption. Specific Aim 1 will use
electrophysiology and chemogenetic approaches to explore the plasticity in aIC to BLA outputs (aICBLA) as well
as the necessity of PV interneurons (aICPV) during retrieval of ethanol-induced CTA. Specific Aim 2 will use
chemogenetics and electrophysiology to explore plasticity in both aICPV and aICBLA neurons during retrieval of
ethanol CTA following long-term ethanol drinking. Specific Aim 3 is a collaborative aim and it will incorporate
slice physiology as well as channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping to explore changes in frontal-limbic
connectivity between aIC, nucleus accumbens (Acb), and BLA. In addition, using fiber photometry we will
measure activity of pyramidal neurons and interneurons simultaneously in the aIC and BLA. Together, all these
studies will help us to identify a novel circuit mechanism that drives tolerance to the aversive properties of
ethanol, which is a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD)."
10758522,"WAKE FOREST TRANSLATIONAL ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTER (WF-TARC)
 OVERALL SUMMARY
The central goal of the Wake Forest Translational Alcohol Research Center (WF-TARC) is to employ
integrated, translational animal and human subjects research to study behavioral correlates and
neurobiological substrates associated with vulnerability and resilience to alcohol use disorder (AUD). This
Center builds on a highly productive translational alcohol research program at WFSM that led to the awarding
of this P50 grant in 2017.
The WF-TARC is comprised of four research projects and two cores. An administrative core provides the
leadership and infrastructure needed to ensure integration across all research projects. This core also provides
biostatistical support and promotes interactions and communication between this Center and the many other
addiction-related research and educational programs at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). A pilot
project core serves to advance the goals and objectives of the WF-TARC. This core funds projects each year
to attract new investigators to bring their talent and expertise to the study of AUD vulnerability.
The unifying research focus of the WF-TARC is to leverage the unique strengths and advantages of animal
and human subjects research to study behavioral correlates of AUD vulnerability and identify neurobiological
adaptations that contribute to this heightened risk of developing this disorder. These studies employ cutting-
edge, multidisciplinary experimental approaches spanning molecular, cellular, circuit, and whole-brain
analyses. Importantly, studies in each project are also seeking to improve AUD treatment outcomes. The well-
integrated conceptual framework and research design facilitates backward and forward interactions across all
projects, facilitating the rapid translation of therapeutic discoveries from animals to humans.
The WF-TARC leverages a well-established, highly collaborative translational alcohol research program at
WFSM and benefits from a strong and growing institutional focus on alcohol and substance use disorders.
This Center will continue to enhance the outstanding educational environment at our institution, providing
unique training opportunities for the students and postdoctoral who will become the next generation of
translational alcohol researchers. Finally, the innovative research supported by the WF-TARC may lead to
improved evidence-based therapies for individuals who are at greatest risk of developing AUD, individuals who
are particularly ill-served by current AUD treatment options."
10745667,"ABSTRACT:
Memory decline accompanies numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases. To inform the development of
effective therapies, understanding how complex memories are encoded in the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex
system (HPC-ERC) is critical. Formation of successful episodic memories (of personal events) requires the
integration of information across dimensions including the context of an experience within a spatial
environment. The proposed research program will determine how the HPC-ERC system flexibly encodes
memories across different spatial environmental contexts using rare invasive neural recordings in humans.
Data will be collected from two distinct but complementary groups of participants with implanted electrodes: (1)
stationary participants with simultaneous single-unit/local field potential (LFP) recordings from the HPC-ERC
and (2) freely moving participants with chronic HPC-ERC iEEG recording electrodes. Participants will perform
an ecologically meaningful 3D immersive virtual reality (VR) spatial navigation task, either at the bedside (1) or
during free movement (2). Findings will illustrate critical neural mechanisms that underlie representations of
space and memory in freely moving humans and how these representations encode contextual changes.
Additionally, this proposal will identify the relationship between single-unit and LFP activity in humans in
relation to spatial navigation and contextual changes, using 3D VR. Results will advance our understanding of
HPC-ERC representations of spatial navigation, memory, and the effect of contextual changes that will
together serve as a scientific foundation for development of neurological therapies for disorders of memory."

Corneal disease and injury are the third most common causes of blindness, affecting over 10 million people
worldwide. The majority of corneal blindness is permanent due to scarring; therefore, controlling the progression
and state of scarring is crucial for the maintenance of vision. Surgical techniques are improving; however, they
are very invasive and may have long-term complications. Clearly, there is a need for therapeutic intervention in
order to reduce the need for corneal transplantation, which is the most commonly used technique for treating
corneal scarring. In the current proposal, we propose to investigate a novel target for corneal scarring treatment
known as Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP). PIP is a 17-kDa single polypeptide chain that is widely expressed in
cancerous breast tissue and is regarded as a diagnostic biomarker for the histopathological diagnosis of this
disease. We were the first to report the role of PIP in the context of cornea. Initially, we showed the interplay
between PIP and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and its ability to modulate all the TGF-β isoforms (in
vitro studies), and more recently we cemented PIP as a biomarker for keratoconus (clinical human studies).
During our recently published and preliminary studies, we observed PIP’s anti-fibrotic ability both in vitro and in
vivo, and discovered modulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondria health following exposure to PIP (in
vitro). Thus, we hypothesize that PIP is critical for corneal wound healing, following an injury/trauma, without the
presence of fibrosis. Utilizing minipigs in vivo and complementary in vitro and ex vivo models, we propose to
further explore these compelling findings and unravel the signaling mechanisms of PIP as well as determine the
efficacy of PIP eye drops, which seem to prevent corneal scaring in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed
studies could ultimately lead to the development of a new ocular drug for corneal trauma. We propose two
complementary, but independent, specific aims to examine the following questions: First, what is PIP’s signaling
cascade and mechanism-of-action? Second, can we develop PIP-based eye drops that can be used as an
alternative and non-invasive solution for corneal scarring treatment? Relevance to Public Health – Corneal
scarring is a major clinical problem and more often than not leads to complete or partial loss of vision. The
development of efficient, non-invasive corneal scarring drug, will likely help us move a step closer towards
resolving a sight threatening process."

The overarching goal of this R01 application (PA-18-278: Innovations in HIV Testing, Adherence, and
Retention to Optimize HIV Care Continuum Outcomes) is to advance the science of mobile health approaches
to increase uptake of repeat HIV self-testing (HST) and linkage to HIV-related care with populations that
underperform on these steps of the HIV care continuum. We propose an intervention entitled “WeTest-
WeLink” that builds on years of formative work with MSM in China (R34MH106349), demonstrating promising
effects from a pilot RCT and strong indication of intervention acceptability, feasibility, and cultural sensitivity.
The intervention uses the “WeChat” mobile app platform, which offers multiple features built into the app that
facilitate health information delivery and communication channels (e.g., capacity for private texts, group chats,
video sharing, GPS, instant messaging, real-time audio and visual communication). Guided by the Information-
Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) model and Minority Stress Theory, we will employ a user-centered design process
to refine and expand app features to support repeat HST uptake, behavioral risk reduction, stigma coping
strategies, and self-efficacy to link to HIV care. We will use an Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Type 1
design consisting of a three site, 2-arm RCT to test HST and linkage to HIV related care outcomes as well as
qualitative research to examine implementation and scalability. We will recruit 1,800 HIV negative MSM in
three cities with HIV high-prevalence among MSM – Chengdu (9%), Suzhou (13%), Wuhan (11%) – allocated
to the intervention (access to the WeTest-WeLink app) or control group (education about HST and passive
referral to HIV care for individuals who test HIV positive). We will assess participants at 6-, 12-, and 18 months
to measure intervention effects on primary outcomes: repeated use of HST (including photographic
confirmation) and linkage to care for individuals who test HIV-positive. Secondary outcomes include sexual risk
behaviors and use of HIV prevention services, and we will conduct mediation analysis to examine theoretical
mechanisms of behavior change. We will qualitatively assess intervention-related process characteristics that
enable and/or impede implementation and scalability informed by the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR). This project will provide the first known evidence for a mobile health
approach to optimize both HIV testing and linkage to care as part of a single intervention continuum with MSM.
Such findings can be crucial for optimizing the care cascade in populations that underutilize HIV services, such
as MSM in China and elsewhere in the world where HIV testing and linkage to care services are sub-optimal."

Female-specific and female-predominant risk factors provide opportunities to improve cardiovascular
disease (CVD) prevention and screening in women. Pregnancy complications are risk markers for future
CVD revealed through the cardiometabolic “stress test” of pregnancy, which can be leveraged for early CVD
prevention before the onset of established risk factors (chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2
diabetes). Women with a history of preeclampsia (a condition involving high blood pressure during
pregnancy) or preterm delivery (<37 weeks’ gestation) have twice the risk of future CVD. Mental health
conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, are twice as common in women
as in men and are also associated with increased CVD risk. Although existing studies and anecdotal
evidence suggest that acute adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs; preeclampsia and preterm delivery) can
constitute a traumatic event for some women and precipitate the development of mental health conditions
after pregnancy, rigorous epidemiologic studies are lacking. The extent to which APOs and mental health
conditions may jointly contribute to CVD in women is also unknown. This project will draw on the strengths
of complementary populations and methodologic approaches, including observational epidemiologic
analyses within the Nurses’ Health Study 2 and 3 (NHS2/3) prospective cohort studies and leveraging
electronic health records (EHR) from the Mass General Brigham health system for both quantitative
prediction modeling using machine learning and to recruit patients with recent acute APOs to participate in
qualitative interviews. This research will address the gaps in the literature by: 1) evaluating the extent to
which the increased CVD risk observed among women with a history of APOs is accounted for by the
development of mental health conditions after pregnancy using data from NHS2/3; 2) identifying clinically
relevant risk and resilience factors from the EHR that influence the risk of developing mental health
conditions after an acute APO; and 3) elucidating the relationship between APOs and subsequent PTSD
secondary to APO-related trauma through semi-structured qualitative patient interviews.
In addition to generating new insights into the accumulation of CVD risk across a woman’s life, this proposal
will provide crucial training for my development into an independent investigator by cultivating new skills in:
1) machine learning using EHR data, 2) qualitative research, and 3) psychiatric epidemiology. Given my
strong background in reproductive and cardiovascular epidemiology, my world-class mentoring team, and
personalized training plan to advance my skillset, I am well equipped to accomplish the proposed research.
The training, mentorship, and protected time provided by this Career Development Award will uniquely
position me as a leading epidemiologist equipped to improve the cardiovascular health of women."

NIEHS defines environmental health as “the field of science that studies how the environment influences
human health and disease”. The environment in this definition includes the natural environment, man-made
chemicals and structures that often pollute the natural environment, and our social interactions and lifestyle
choices. Because toxic environments are linked directly to human health and disease, a critical need exists to
educate the American population on this relationship to allow us to make informed choices about the amount of
risk we are willing to take. Stated differently, to improve public health we need to improve environmental health
literacy (EHL), the goal of RFA-ES-21-008 (Innovative Approaches for Improving Environmental Health
Literacy). The RFA requests collaborations between small businesses and environmental scientists “to develop
novel tools, activities, or materials to build EHL”. In response, Nzumbe Inc. has partnered with media experts
(SquishyMedia) environmental and education scientists at Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon State
University and local undergraduate institutions to submit this proposal. Our strategy is to use epigenetic
science as an education bridge to improve EHL because the basics of this science are relatively easy to
understand and the epigenome responds to environmental exposures in ways that can improve or worsen
health. To accomplish this goal, our SBIR Phase I and now our Phase II application focuses on developing two
“experiential” educational tools. The first tool, delivers interactive learning modules in an online software
application that utilizes “gamification” principles to teach users how the environment impacts our epigenome
and health as a consequence. Gamification offers a variety of benefits associated with learning outcomes,
including enhancing user-engagement, learning, and knowledge retention. Our software application will include
the “EpiMon” app, a stylized interactive game that will utilize the epigenetic principles that the student has
learned and apply them to fictional creatures (EpiMon) in a fictional world. The second tool, is an educational
laboratory kit that will emphasize and tie in principles taught with the software product. The lab kit utilizes a
simple and safe model organism, Neurospora crassa, to demonstrate basic epigenetic principles and how
environmental exposures can influence the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. While the kit will contain
control experiments to demonstrate these principles, it will also offer the students the ability to experiment with
growth conditions to determine their impact on epigenetic gene regulation. Unlike most laboratory kits in the
marketplace where the experimental outcome is pre-determined, the experiential approach of our kit puts the
keys in the hands of the student. Results will be reported to an accompanying software application module
where students can compare their results with classmates and other schools to identify exposures with
epigenetic activity. Successful completion of the proposed work will enable us to extend these tools to public
school students and the interactive software to the lay public and public health professionals at little to no cost."

Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) represent a spectrum of painful disorders that afflicts approximately 5 to
10% of the US population with approximate annual healthcare costs of $4 billion. Degenerative disorders,
internal derangements including disc displacement and hypo/hyper-mobility, and arthralgia of the
temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which together are referred to as TMJ disorders (TMJDs), are common in
many subjects with TMD. No definitive etio-pathologic diagnostics are currently available, and treatments are
non-specific and largely palliative. While a subset of TMJDs occur in isolation, a substantial proportion are
associated with comorbidities such as headaches and/or fibromyalgia. These two distinct patient cohorts
together with the peculiar predilection of TMJDs for women of reproductive age as opposed to the late onset of
similar disorders in other joints, point to unique and complex interactions of systemic and local factors. As
such, multi-omic signatures and cell networks at the local and systemic levels will facilitate specific diagnostics
and clinically meaningful stratification of patients between and within each of these cohorts. Currently there is a
substantial void in connecting the molecular multi-omic signatures and cellular networks / interactions with
clinical disease subtypes, etiopathogenesis, progression and severity. Our long-term goal is to identify local
and systemic single cell and biofluid multi-omic molecular profiles from a spectrum of TMJD subtypes and
severities to delineate relationships between clinical phenotypes with deep omic signatures and cell networks
that will nucleate new directions for rational and precision therapies, prognostics and prevention. We expect
that such multi-omic analyses combined with case control and longitudinal clinical and imaging data will
provide critical insights on novel molecular signatures and networks associated with specific disease subtypes
/ severity and the interactions between cell subpopulations in perpetuating or mitigating disease progression.
These goals will be achieved through two milestones-based phases involving (1) a UH2 feasibility phase to
develop and implement protocols and quality assurance; recruitment of subjects and clinical disease
categorization; sample collection to pilot sample handling and omic assays; data standardization, management
and access; and developing a robust statistical plan; and (2) a UH3 implementation and discovery phase to
identify distinct cell networks and molecular signatures towards a new rational classification of TMJDs and
comorbidities; and to validate salivary omics biomarkers of these endotypes. Given the assembled expertise
and plans, we expect that these studies will provide strong foundations and depth of knowledge needed to
more rationally stratify patients into TMJD and comorbidity subtypes and severity categories; provide the basis
for new directions of translational science in diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics based on multi-omics of
individual disease subtypes and the implementation of precision medicine for these patients; and define
homeostatic and disease signatures that are specific to the TMJ as opposed to appendicular joints."

Targeting immune checkpoint signaling with blocking antibodies has reached a limitation in the treatment of
advanced cancers. Although antibodies that bind programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are effective in blocking
PD-L1's extracellular interaction with PD-1 receptor on T cells, the potential adaptive upregulation of PD-L1 and
its recycling from intracellular compartment to the cell surface may compromise their efficacy. Importantly, the
discovery of PD-L1's intracellular functions in cancer cells to promote thier survival and metabolism
also highlight
a mechanism by which tumor cells can gain resistance to cytotoxic therapy and
call for a new strategy to target
PD-L1.
There is therefore a critical need to design, test, and translate new agents that can
simultaneously inhibit
PD-L1's extracellular and intracellular functions.
This application will utilize a new PD-L1 antibody (clone H1A)
that can reduce the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells through disrupting the association of PD-L1 with CMTM6
(a molecule that can stabilize PD-L1 recycling and expression) and subsequently directing PD-L1 for degradation.
H1A-induced degradation of PD-L1 may not only disrupt PD-1/PD-L1 interactions due to the loss of PD-L1, thus
removing PD-1's suppressive signals in T cells, but also disrupt PD-L1's cell-intrinsic functions within tumor cells
and myeloid cells, thereby decreasing tumor resistance to chemotherapy and releasing the immune-stimulatory
function of myeloid cells. Thus, H1A antibody may be a good candidate for targeting the dual functions of PD-L1
for cancer therapy. Based on preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that intracellular signaling
through PD-L1 results in tumor resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and limits the immune-stimulatory function
of myeloid cells. Thus, targeted agents that result in degradation of PD-L1 and elimination of its intracellular
signaling ability represent a novel therapeutic strategy that will both synergize with chemotherapy and improve
the immune response. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Determine how H1A
antibody synergizes with chemotherapy to overcome tumor resistance; (2) Determine how H1A antibody
promotes an enhanced T cell response to attack tumors. To further assess the future clinical use of H1A antibody,
a fully humanized version of H1A and humanized PD-1 and PD-L1 mice have been produced, which will allow
for evaluation of the therapeutic effects of H1A either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and exploration
of H1A's new mechanism of action in vivo. The overall impact of the proposed research is high because it will
provide a new therapeutic agent that is capable of targeting the dual functions of PD-L1, resulting in improved
efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy and an enhanced immune response. This strategy represents a significant
paradigm shift within the field in terms of how to target immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1 for future clinical
applications."
10733430,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription. It chronically infects >250 million people worldwide and kills ~870,000 annually. Therapy primarily employs nucleos(t)ide analog drugs against viral DNA synthesis that often drive viremia below the detection limit. However, replication is not eliminated, and HBV resurges if drugs are withdrawn. Nevertheless, treatment cures up to 6% of patients, so more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV further. Reverse transcription requires the viral ribonuclease H (RNaseH) that destroys the RNA after it has been copied into DNA. Blocking the RNaseH prevents synthesis of viral genomes, including both the key nuclear cccDNA form of the genome and the DNA in virions. Drugs have not yet been designed against the RNaseH. We developed the first screening pipeline for HBV RNaseH inhibitors and found RNaseH >150 inhibitors that block HBV replication. The most effective is an N-hydroxypyridinedione (HPD) with an EC50 of 0.11 μM and a therapeutic index (TI, CC50/EC50) of 300. An HPD hit compound suppressed HBV viremia in mice with humanized livers. We also found that napthyridinones [NPTH, comprised of true napthyridinones (HNOs) and the closely related hydroxypyridopyrimidinones (HPPs)] inhibit HBV replication with EC50s as low as 0.95 μM and TIs up to 83. Achieving EC50s as low as 0.11 μM and TIs up to 350 after assessing only 51 HPDs, combined with good activity of the related NPTH chemotype, led Drs. Tavis (HBV virologist), Meyers, Zhan, and Zoidis and (medicinal chemists) to join forces to develop the HPDs and NPTHs into pre-clinical leads for novel HBV drugs. Aim 1. Lead optimization of HPD HBV inhibitors. We will synthesize up to 125 HPDs based on our existing structure-activity relationships (SAR) and evaluate their efficacy, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Aim 2. Hit-to-lead development of NPTH HBV inhibitors. We will synthesize up to 100 HNOs and 100 HPPs and evaluate their efficacy, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Aim 3. Assess specificity for HBV of the novel inhibitors. We will evaluate HPDs and NPTHs for induction of heteroduplex formation in HBV capsids and suppression of cccDNA formation. Synergy with other HBV drugs will be assessed. Selectivity will be measured against microbial pathogens and human metalloenzymes including RNaseH1. Aim 4. Evaluate pharmacological parameters for HPD and NPTH HBV inhibitors. We will assess stability, cellular permeability, plasma protein binding, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of key inhibitors. Efficacy of the best compounds will be tested against HBV replication in HBV-infected mice carrying humanized livers. These studies will advanced HBV RNaseH inhibitors as first-in-mechanism and first-in-class HBV drug leads. The eventual anti-HBV RNaseH drugs are anticipated to be used in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs to suppress HBV replication enough to clear HBV in many more patients than current therapies achieve."
10732759,"The goal of this proposal is to establish a new model for masked detection and frequency resolution, applicable
to listeners with normal hearing and hearing loss, based on realistic physiological response properties. We are
developing a new, fundamental framework for neural representations of acoustic stimuli that can predict a wide
range of psychoacoustic phenomena. This framework is focused on neural fluctuations of auditory-nerve (AN)
fibers, rather than on energy, average rates, or phase-locking to temporal fine structure. Neural fluctuations
(NFs) refer to the relatively slow changes over time in AN responses (i.e., changes with rates ranging from 10s
to a few 100 Hz). Neural fluctuations in this frequency range are of interest because they strongly excite, or
suppress, neurons in the auditory central nervous system. The NF model is based on known nonlinear
properties of inner-hair-cell and AN responses, and thus has important implications for interpreting masking
results in listeners with sensorineural hearing loss. A representation of masked sounds based on the NF model
is an alternative to the commonly accepted excitation-pattern representation provided by the power spectrum
model of masking. The NF model successfully describes basic masking thresholds, as well as many
experimental paradigms for which the power-spectrum (or energy) model fails. The NF model is not limited to
low frequencies, as are models based on phase-locking to temporal fine structure. Here, the NF framework will
be applied not only to masking paradigms, but also to stimulus paradigms that focus on frequency resolution,
such as discrimination of the fundamental frequency of harmonic complex tones, or detection of increments in
profile-analysis stimuli. Current models for the representation of these stimuli rely on a conceptual peripheral
filter bank with critical bandwidths, estimated from human masking results using the power spectrum model of
masking. Critical bandwidths, assumed to limit the frequency resolution of the auditory representations of
complex sounds, are not consistent with known physiology. In contrast, frequency resolution according to the
NF model is grounded on physiologically realistic response properties of AN fibers and sensitivity to neural
fluctuations observed in the midbrain. Finally, to explain perception based on NF cues across the entire range
of audible sound levels, we will extend our AN model to include NF-driven feedback gain control, guided by the
known physiology and anatomy of the medial olivocochlear efferent system. The studies proposed here
include: i) computational modeling to predict human thresholds, including re-examination of classical datasets
that can, and those that cannot, be explained by the power-spectrum model, ii) related physiological studies in
the midbrain, where cells are strongly sensitive to fluctuating inputs, and iii) new psychophysical studies
designed to challenge the NF model, in listeners with normal hearing and those with sensorineural hearing
loss."

The overarching goals of the Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments (CAPHE) partnership,
established in 2014, are to: (1) develop new knowledge on local community-prioritized air pollutants; (2)
implement components of our scientifically-grounded community-informed Public Health Action Plan (PHAP) to
reduce exposure and improve health; (3) expand community engagement in environmental health research
and action; and (4) evaluate the process and impact of these collaborative efforts. Building on long-standing
community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships engaging community-based organizations
(CBOs), local and state governments, and academic partners, CAPHE conducted collaborative research,
training, education and outreach on air pollution, an environmental priority of the Detroit community, and health
impacts. We documented air pollutant levels, sources and distribution, quantified health impacts and
inequities, identified mitigation strategies, and projected health benefits of selected strategies. Our PHAP
detailed 25 scientifically based community-prioritized recommendations and action strategies to reduce
pollutant exposure and adverse health effects. CAPHE partners, leading advocates for air quality and health in
Detroit, are working to implement prioritized recommendations. This renewal application, CAPHE: Advancing
Air Quality and Health, will substantially expand the scope and impact of our successful research-to-action
partnership through four aims: (1) increase knowledge of environmental exposures and associated health
impacts by establishing a community-based ambient monitoring network and data portal for key air pollutants
(PM2.5, PM10, organic carbon, black carbon); (2) improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in schools and
other child-serving organizations located near major roads and industrial sites with high levels of cumulative
risk, using advanced air filtration practices and other strategies; (3) engage youth, educators, parents, CBOs
and business leaders in air quality research and translation, increasing environmental health literacy, access to
resources, and skills working with decision makers; and (4) increase effectiveness, engagement and impact of
actions in Specific Aims 1-3 using ongoing formative process and impact/outcome evaluation. The proposed
project will be implemented by a team that includes five Detroit CBOs with extensive records of environmental
leadership, five academic researchers with complementary expertise, and experienced state and local
government partners. CAPHE has a strong history of CBPR, experience in air quality monitoring, data
interpretation, and impact analysis (Aim 1); IEQ improvements (Aim 2); community engagement and translation
of research to action (Aim 3); and process and impact evaluation to maximize engagement and effectiveness
(Aim 4). This research-to-action proposal addresses community priorities of air quality and children's health
using linked, collaborative activities that will reduce exposure and adverse health effects and support sustained
engagement. Results have will be useful for communities globally that experience high cumulative risk."

Southern and East Africa is home to 54% of the world’s people living with HIV, with Southern Africa remaining
as the epicenter of the global HIV pandemic. The proposed Aurum South and East African Clinical Trials Unit
(ASEA CTU) brings together a unique South–South partnership led by three internationally recognized
investigators and including five clinical research sites (CRSs) (three in South Africa, one in Zambia, and one in
Uganda) experienced in conducting HIV and TB treatment and prevention trials. The ASEA CTU has a strong
centralized management structure, well-developed CRSs, access to the required study populations, and
experience conducting HIV and TB treatment and prevention trials. While there have been advances in treating
and preventing HIV and TB, we need to develop new treatment and prevention tools to control HIV and end the
TB epidemic. The ASEA CTU’s primary goal is to use its collective scientific leadership, infrastructure,
experience, and strong community relationships to partner with three Networks to meet the following aims: AIM
1: Conduct trials of HIV vaccines and antibodies for HIV prevention. We need a safe, effective HIV vaccine that
can be delivered at scale to combat HIV; antibodies that could be delivered through passive infusion or induced
by vaccination would complement taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) before possible HIV exposure to prevent
becoming infected with HIV. AIM 2: Conduct trials of HIV and TB therapeutics, and TB preventive therapy and
vaccines. In order to end the TB epidemic, we need shorter, more potent combinations of drugs to treat TB
disease or infection that is susceptible or resistant to the currently available TB drugs, and effective vaccines to
prevent disease or re-occurrence of TB once treated. Despite great advances in the treatment of HIV, adherence
to and retention in care remain problems; we need new, safe, simple, effective, and long-lasting forms of ART
that will promote uptake and address adherence challenges. AIM 3: Participate in studies of novel long acting
antiretrovirals, multipurpose technologies, and integrated strategies for HIV prevention. Our experience suggests
that more targeted and individually tailored interventions are required to overcome adherence challenges with
existing prevention options. Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancy remain
high and underscores the need for technologies that can prevent HIV and other conditions at the same time,
such as STIs and pregnancy."
10918137,"The heart and the mind: an integrative approach to brain-body interactions in the
zebrafish
Our current U19 has focused primarily on Exteroception, which can be defined as the accumulated sensory experience
originating from events in the outside world. However, all neural computation takes place in the context of the body,
which is subject to the dynamics of hunger, fatigue, motivation and diurnal cycles. The information that reaches the brain
from the organs and receptors inside of the body, summarized under the umbrella term of Interoception, is therefore
overlaid onto exteroceptive computations. This adds behavioral variability to any animal task, from changing vigor to
altering valence of rewards to vetoing responses altogether.
To better understand such embodied computation, we will first incorporate cardiac and respiratory variables that
dynamically report basic internal states to our standard behavioral classification methods, and we will include detailed
characterization and modeling of the autonomic and intracardiac nervous system in our functional imaging studies.
Finally, as a critical resource for the description and validation of the generated neural circuit models, we will create a
complete body-and-brain connectome of the larval zebrafish.
This research plan is aligned with the three levels of understanding articulated by David Marr more than thirty years ago,
who emphasized the importance of considering Evolutionary Principles, Algorithmic Representation and Hardware
Implementation as a unified and interconnected approach for understanding the brain. Following this framework, we first
try to isolate aspects of fish behavior that are adapted to their native environment and context. We next use a variety of
controlled behavioral assays to extract the algorithmic rules that govern the dynamics of modular sensorimotor
transformations, and that are augmented by knowledge about internal state changes as reflected by observed modulation of
cardiac and respiratory activity. To characterize the hardware implementation of these explicit and latent behavioral
algorithms, we propose to first measure cellular activity using brain-wide functional light imaging of the central, the
autonomic and the intracardiac nervous systems (CNS, ANS and ICNS). We next will use these comprehensive datasets to
generate realistic circuit models of the observed dynamics. These models will then guide a series of circuit dissection
experiments, such as optogenetic perturbations of specific cell types, targeted patch-clamp physiology and sparse
connectomics tracing, allowing us to validate, extend, and constrain our models. We note that this approach also affords us
the opportunity to discover new circuit elements and circuit motifs, and novel ways to implement computational
algorithms by the brain.
Another extension of our current U19 is the addition of a dynamical modeling framework for these behaviors, where
animals can interact flexibly with the environment, and where we consider multiple time scales of interaction. We believe
that this constitutes a different and perhaps ethologically more relevant approach when compared to the highly
constrained, simplified and repetitive challenges we used before. Further, this framework is well suited in characterizing
the continuous process of cardiac control and its interaction with behavioral modulation."
10769896,"Project Summary:
The project addresses an important problem - multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common cause of
neurological disability in young adults after trauma. While the approval of numerous immunotherapies has had
an impact on reducing inflammatory disease activity in relapsing remitting MS, there are no therapies to date
that enhance repair of the myelin or markedly influence the progressive stage of the disease. Although
non-inflammatory mechanisms may contribute to progressive MS, several recent papers highlight a critical role
for ongoing inflammation within the brain at or next to sites of tissue injury. A direct pathogenic role for T
cells in progressive MS has been suggested by the presence of lymphoid meningeal follicles, which are
associated with cortical demyelination and thinning. A more detailed understanding of how immune cells
inhibit remyelination is critical for developing therapies to enhance remyelination and halt progressive MS.
 Despite observational evidence that immune cells may suppress or promote
remyelination, there is remarkably little known regarding the specific mechanisms by which these processes
occur. This project addresses a barrier to progress in the field because our understanding
of why remyelination fails in disease is presently limited because we have not elucidated the
pathways involved in failed oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation. We plan to pursue an exciting
novel observation that not only do OPCs fail to differentiate into myelin producing cells, but in an
inflammatory environment they adopt an immune phenotype (iOPCs) and can prime CD8 T cells, as
well as become targets of the cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). This represents a paradigm shift in thinking
about OPC biology and remyelination.
 We will characterize the profile, fate and function of iOPC. We seek to understand the mechanisms by
which they activate CD8 T cells that in turn kill a subset of the iOPC as target cells. We will track iOPC using
fate mapping strategies and two-photon intravital microscopy through cranial windows. We aim to develop drug
therapies that target the NFkB signaling pathway involved in MHC expression using several novel therapeutic
approaches including the type 2 diabetes mellitus drug exenatide and an agonist of the NLRX-1 signaling
molecule that normally regulates NFkB expression."
10747355,"This proposal focuses on addressing one of the most fundamental questions regarding OL biology: What
axonal cues in the CNS microenvironment control OL differentiation and myelination? While it is still yet
unclear whether the spatial and temporal patterns of myelination are dependent on inductive or inhibitory cues
(or both), we know that exclusively axons – but not all axons – are myelinated by OLs in parallel with neuronal
circuit maturation. This suggests that axon-derived signals must be involved in coordinating this process. In
this proposal, we have identified a novel axon-derived peptide class, namely dynorphins that promote OL
differentiation and myelination. Neuropeptides, have several characteristics that make them an ideal axonal
signal to regulate myelination. They are stored in dense core vesicles and released only in response to high
levels of neuronal activity, a phenomenon that might signal a form of maturation that qualifies an axon for
myelination. Neuropeptides bind to G-protein coupled receptors and have slow-acting effects that may include
altering gene expression, providing a mechanism through which they might alter cellular fate. In this proposal
we will investigate: 1. Whether OLs and their precursors are influenced by the neuropeptide class, dynorphin,
2. Whether dynorphins are released in response to neuronal activity to regulate myelination and 3. Whether
dynorphins influence myelination globally or is restricted only to dynorphin expressing axons. Recent studies
demonstrate that biophysical properties of fiber diameter, inhibitory molecules and neuronal activity may all
affect OL precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, differentiation, and the selection of axons for myelination (Gibson
et al., 2014; Hines et al., 2015; Mensch et al., 2015; Redmond et al., 2016; Mitew et al., 2018; Mayoral et al.,
2018). Here, we provide the molecular mechanism and downstream signaling pathways for a specific
subset of neurons that may underlie activity dependent differentiation and myelination. Our preliminary
data place us in a unique position to determine whether dynorphins are a neuropeptide class that represents
an axonal cue to control OL differentiation and myelination. We believe that these findings should impart
valuable insight in providing a framework for identifying additional neuropeptides and transmitters that may
influence oligodendroglial lineage cells, as well as for profiling inhibitory and inductive cues for myelination."
10747352,"Project Summary
The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker
signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness
and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose
finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac
arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized
after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving
survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches.
The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical
illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which
individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high-
performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We
hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that
through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that
define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of
these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they
will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project
will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these
current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when
interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized
treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing
disability."
10524676,"SUMMARY
Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial pathogen and a leading global cause of ventilator-
associated pneumonia. This pathogen also infects a number of other anatomical sites, resulting in wound, urinary
tract, and bloodstream infections, meningitis, and endocarditis. A. baumannii infections are extremely recalcitrant
to therapeutic interventions, largely due to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by this pathogen. Nosocomial
transmissions of A. baumannii frequently occur in critically ill hospital patients, typically following contact with
contaminated hospital surfaces, personnel, or medical devices. Bacteria persisting on hospital surfaces must
tolerate an onslaught of environmental stresses, principal among them being the loss of water, or desiccation.
A. baumannii is extremely desiccation tolerant and this phenotype is observed across a wide spectrum of clinical
and laboratory isolates, suggesting that genes promoting desiccation tolerance are broadly conserved in this
pathogen. However, the factors promoting desiccation tolerance in A. baumannii remain largely undefined.
Additionally, it is well established that exposure to environmental stresses modulates the virulence of A.
baumannii; however, the impact that persistence in a desiccated state has on the transmission and virulence of
A. baumannii has not been explored. In preliminary experiments, we have discovered that Lon protease serves
as a critical regulator of the A. baumannii response to desiccation and we have determined that Lon regulates
the expression of a highly disordered protein, DtpA, which is required for the extreme desiccation tolerance of
this organism. Additionally, we have found that desiccated A. baumannii causes more virulent disease in a
murine model of pneumonia, suggesting that factors required to tolerate desiccation may promote pathogenesis
within the mammalian host. Here, we propose to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these
phenotypes and reveal the mechanisms linking environmental persistence and pathogenicity in A. baumannii by
1) defining the mechanism of Lon protease-mediated regulation of dtpA transcription, 2) elucidating the
regulation and function of Lon protease in response to desiccation, and 3) interrogating the molecular link
between A. baumannii desiccation tolerance and virulence. Together, these studies will improve our
understanding of how A. baumannii persists in the environment and define the impact that environmental
persistence has on the transmission of this emerging pathogen. Additionally, findings from this work may be
applied to the study of other nosocomial pathogens to more broadly understand how bacterial transmission
occurs in hospital settings."

ABSTRACT
Health and function of the nervous system relies on astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell in the mammalian
brain. Astrocytes are integral components of brain architecture, and critically regulate brain function and
plasticity through dynamic interactions with synapses. Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein
in astrocytes is common in aging and is exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, hyper-phosphorylated
tau in neurons detaches from microtubules to form soluble aggregates, destabilizing the microtubule
cytoskeleton. Pathogenic soluble tau aggregates (also called tau oligomers) are then released and transfer trans-
neuronally, promoting tau aggregation and destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in target cells.
Aging contributes the largest biological risk for AD; yet the mechanisms that link aging to AD remain elusive. The
development of cellular senescence and the accumulation of senescent cells during aging compromises tissue
function. Senescent astrocytes accumulate in AD brain. We discovered that, similar to trans-neuronal
propagation, soluble pathogenic tau aggregates are transmitted to astrocytes, where they potently trigger
microtubule destabilization and cellular senescence. The functional impact of tau transmission to astrocytes, and
its contribution to AD, however, remain unexplored. Our central hypotheses are that: (a) tau-induced astrocyte
senescence is a key driver of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD, and (b) removal of pathogenic
tau or senescent astrocytes will treat AD-related dysfunction in a surrogate model of AD by restoring neuronal
function. We propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define how tau transmission causes astrocyte senescence,
and will identify heterogeneous subtypes of senescent astrocytes and their secreted factors in a surrogate
model of AD tauopathy; Aim 2 will (a) establish the therapeutic potential of pathogenic tau or senescent cell
removal in AD-related neuronal and cognitive dysfunction, (b) determine, in human brains, how accumulation of
astrocyte tau and of senescent astrocytes is linked to molecular abnormalities identified in Aim 1 during AD
progression; and (c) define the incidence of heterogeneous subtypes of senescent astrocytes identified in Aim 1
in human AD. This work will address, for the first time, the involvement of tau-induced astrocyte senescence in
AD etiology, and will markedly advance knowledge of how pathogenic tau (and the cellular events it triggers) and
senescence itself can be targeted therapeutically. By singling out astrocyte senescence as a novel mechanism
of AD-like pathogenesis in mice, we will open up a completely new avenue of investigation in AD.
Because tau immunotherapy is being advanced in the clinic and the senolytics we will use are FDA-approved,
our results could have rapid translational potential, contributing new and urgently needed tools to treat AD and
potentially other dementias.

10746793,"ABSTRACT
About 55% of children with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment and up to 80% of children
with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. Treatments are often not initiated until issues are significantly
impacting the child and family. This study aims to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic
health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in,
and coordination of needed mental health services for children. The first task of the study will focus on the
implementation of a predictive model to identify symptomatic children with no diagnosed mental health
disorder(s) or treatments initiated. The tool identifies patients with documentation of mental health symptoms
or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Using this
predictive algorithm, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm
patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200
patients per arm (n=400). Children with (1) a new mental health diagnosis but no treatment initiated; (2) a new
mental health medication ordered with no mental health diagnosis; and (3) symptoms identified by the
predictive model with no new mental health diagnosis or treatment initiated will be recruited. The study
intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The
navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services,
conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 psychotherapy sessions
(when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental
health providers in the community, and reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are
missed. The primary outcome is the percentage of youth initiating psychotherapy. The secondary outcome is
the percentage of youth with at least 4 mental health visits. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have
higher rates of psychotherapy use compared to the control arm. We will also assess initiation of psychotropic
medications. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to
include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention
(“dose” of navigation) received."
10797027,"Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older individuals. Importantly,
alcohol misuse has been associated with increased pneumonia for over 200 years. While the role of alcohol in
bacterial pneumonia susceptibility and severity remains to be fully understood, it is essential to define the at-
risk conditions and unique needs of those who misuse alcohol and to do so immediately to optimize clinical
care. Disease is impacted by the sum of all environmental exposures during one’s life. Collectively referred to
as the exposome, little alcohol-mediated lung injury has taken into consideration such real-world complexity. In
this 5-year project, we will investigate the alcohol exposome in lung bacterial infections. Compared to the
general public, those with alcohol use disorders (AUD) can be characterized by heavy cigarette smoking
leading to pre-existing lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major co-
morbidity for pneumonia. Likewise, nutritional deficiencies play an important role in disease pathogenesis. Our
knowledge about how such exposome characteristics impact alcohol-mediated lung injury is limited. However,
results from our previous lung alcohol research have already demonstrated that AUD are associated with cilia
dysfunction. Our results also demonstrate that AUD results in decreased surfactant anti-microbial action.
Surfactant protein D has been documented to specifically bind to and aggregate bacteria for optimal
microbicidal action. We hypothesize that altered innate lung defense at the level of mucociliary clearance and
anti-microbial surfactants will negatively impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, placing
individuals with AUD particularly in harm’s way. Our assembled team of investigators include a VA Research
Career Scientist with 26 years’ experience in the impact of alcohol on lung injury and repair, a pulmonologist
whose expertise is on characterizing primary human lung clinical samples, experienced alcohol liver injury
researcher with extracellular vesicle expertise, a senior professor of pharmacy recognized internationally as a
zinc expert, and a junior investigator who is already an expert in alcohol-mediated gut dysbiosis and bacterial
infections. Our established expertise in mouse models of alcohol injury combined with our existing biobank of
human lung cells and tissues, we propose to address our hypothesis by identifying any differences in S.
pneumoniae infection responses due to a complex exposome model of alcohol, cigarette smoking, and zinc
deficiency. We will specifically identify in these groups any changes in cilia beat controlling clearance and the
role of reactive aldehydes generated by liver- and gut-derived extracellular vesicles. Such studies will be
performed for the first time in animal and cell models relevant to AUD. Defining the modalities of risk will also
empower clinicians to make informed preventive care decisions in the context of alcohol misuse."
10797028,"This project is a part of a P50 grant on exposome and alcohol. It is focused on understanding the innate
immunity mechanisms, by which environmental exposure to ethanol metabolites increases the levels of
hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection and promotes its persistence and liver injury. Despite a prophylactic vaccine
availability, the number of chronic HBV carriers is estimated to be as high as 250 million worldwide, with an
annual death rate of 800,000. The incidences of chronic HBV -infection, the viral load and the outcomes of
end-stage diseases are higher in hepatitis B patients abusing alcohol, but the mechanisms behind these
events are still unclear. Here, we will study how exposures to virus, alcohol and unsaturated fatty acids affect
interferon (IFN) response in hepatocytes. We will also study the protective effect of macrophages on the
activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the reduction of HBV levels in hepatocytes. One anti-viral
ISGs, APOBEC3G, is of special importance since it degrades HBV cccDNA. This macrophage-hepatocyte
communication is mediated via extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the protective effects of EVs secreted
from macrophages may be ruined when cells are exposed to alcohol. High-fat diet further exacerbates hepatitis
B pathogenesis enhanced by alcohol. Our central hypothesis is: that exposure to ethanol metabolites impairs
interferon signaling in HBV-infected hepatocytes and virus-activated macrophages both directly, via limiting
anti-viral ISG induction, and indirectly, via disrupting the protective EV-mediated crosstalk between
macrophages and hepatocytes, thereby promoting intrahepatic viral spread and enhanced pathogenesis. The
suppressive effects of ethanol on innate immunity in HBV-expressing hepatocytes may be further enhanced by
cell exposure to unsaturated fatty acids. For this study, we proposed 3 Aims:
Aim 1: To study the regulation of HBV-infection in hepatocytes by the activation of ISGs via the RIG1-MAVS-
IRF3 or the cGAS-STING-IRF3 and the JAK-STAT1/2 pathways under exposure to ethanol metabolites and
unsaturated fatty acids.
Aim 2: In the settings of alcohol and unsaturated fatty acid exposures, to assess the EV-mediated crosstalk
between HBV-infected hepatocytes and macrophages, which regulates anti-viral protection by innate immunity.
Aim 3: To elucidate the contribution of ethanol and high-fat diet to HBV expression, ISG induction, and liver
steatosis/inflammation in transgenic HBV-replicating mice, and to study whether these exposures affect other
organs/tissues (lung, heart, spleen, pancreas, adipose tissue) in these mice.
The obtained information has the strong potential to be translated to clinical practice and interventions through
the development of biomarkers for innate immunity dysfunction and the identification of possible treatment
targets."
10797029,"It is well-established that liver is the primary target of ethanol action and alcohol-associated liver
disease (AALD) is a major health concern in general population. It should also be noted that the
incidence of heart disease due to chronic alcohol consumption continues to rise owing to the
increased chronic alcohol drinking habits among humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that a
strong positive correlation exists between alcohol-associated liver injury (AALD) and alcoholic
cardiomyopathy (ACM). It has recently become clear that the combination of obesity with heavy
drinking exacerbates ethanol-induced organ injury. Thus, there is an urgent need to define
mechanisms by which obesity and alcohol either individually or in combination, promote liver and
cardiac injury. Central to our hypothesis is that thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TP-R) is a
common link between AALD and ACM. TP-R is a G-protein coupled receptor, expressed in all
tissues, and is activated by thromboxane A2 as well as isoprostanes, eicosanoids mediating
inflammatory response and oxidative stress. TP-R is known to play a role in the pathophysiology of
several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and certain autoimmune
diseases. Little is known, however about a role for TP-R in modulating obesity and alcohol-related
disorders. We present exciting preliminary data in this proposal that ethanol-induced hepatic
inflammation is greatly attenuated in TP-R-KO mice. Interestingly, our preliminary data also show
that TP-R expression is significantly higher in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
collected from patients with obesity or CVD compared to control subjects and therefore, its
involvement in both AALD and ACM might be important, and present opportunities for treatment.
Based on previous reports and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the presence of obesity,
chronic alcohol consumption promotes liver and cardiac injury and this effect is mediated at least in
part, via activation of TP-R through its effects on inflammation and oxidative stress. We will use
nutritional, genetic, and molecular approaches to determine the role of TP-R in altering AALD and
ACM. In Aim 1, we will define the role of hepatocyte-TP-R in modulating ethanol- and/or obesity-
induced liver injury and cardiomyopathy in mice. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of cardiomyocyte-
TP-R in modulating ethanol- and/or obesity-induced liver injury and cardiomyopathy in mice. Overall,
the proposed research will uncover the role of TP-R in modulating AALD and ACM in the presence
or absence of obesity, to identify potential mechanisms, and to set the stage for the development of
effective therapeutic agents for human patients affected by the metabolic complications of obesity
and/or excess ethanol consumption."

understudied and underserved groups of patients, who, in the face of advanced age and serious illness, are
more likely to be single, living alone, without children, lacking in social support, and at risk for and fearful of
discrimination. The applicant is a senior physician at Mayo Clinic and has a long track record of research in
studying symptoms and psychosocial issues in ill patients (400+ publications), mentoring (50+ mentees +
principal investigator/program director of career development program K12CA090628-20), and serving as a
leader in both her home institution and nationally. This track record and these experiences are brought to this
application with the goal of understanding and addressing the unmet needs of these groups of older sexual
and gender minority (SGM) patients – defined by the NIH as “individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, two-spirit, queer, and/or intersex.” A uniquely rich institutional environment that includes the
Kogod Center on Aging; the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center); a
robust Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCATS); a nationally renowned statistics and data center;
the robust Mayo Clinic practice, which provides depth and breadth of clinical expertise in the management of a
vast array of serious illnesses to over 1 million patients per year; and, last but not least, the 120,000+ (and
growing) social media platform, Mayo Clinic Connect -- perhaps the largest such patient-centric electronic
medical resource in the world -- will set the stage for the development of this programmatic infrastructure.
Novel, ground-breaking research early in the grant-cycle will consist of a needs-assessment that uses both
qualitative and quantitative methodology to learn the unremitting symptomatology and unrelieved psychosocial
hardships of these older patients and that relies on Mayo Clinic Connect (an estimated 30% of users self-report
as 65+ years of age) to reach older SGM patients anonymously and to learn confidentially about their
concerns. This needs assessment will give rise to a series of annual requests for pilot grant applications
aimed at young investigators. Young investigators who are awarded a pilot project will acquire mentoring from
the applicant, engage in coursework, participate in a weekly seminar series, learn from a biannual visiting
professor series, begin to learn to contribute to CCATS course development on older SGM patients, and
further launch their careers as investigators in this field. National/international experts in their respective fields
and a patient advocate will serve on an advisory committee, providing programmatic guidance over the 5-year
grant cycle. These efforts are destined to establish a sustainable, funded research program to improve the
lives of older SGM patients with serious illness."

The proposed U54 program Spatiotemporal Tumor Analytics for Guiding Sequential Targeted-Inhibitor --
Immunotherapy Combinations (ST-Analytics) is designed to develop the recent conceptual advance that
targeted inhibitor + cancer immunotherapy (IT) combination treatments may yield significantly greater patient
benefit if those treatments are administered in sequence rather than simultaneously. Analysis of retrospective
clinical data coupled with in vivo therapeutic modeling using syngeneic models of murine melanoma strongly
support this concept. In fact, the picture that has emerged in melanoma is that immune factors can play a strong
role in driving resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy, and that lead-in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
can ‘prime’ both the primary tumor and distal metastases (including brain metastases) for eradication when the
IT is subsequently combined with MAPKi. This observation opens the doors for immune based strategies, such
as ICB or adoptive cell therapy (ACT), as sequential combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance.
However, this concept introduces a number of new variables, including dosing, sequence, and timing. This can
make the design and execution of clinical trials that can yield statistically significant outcomes impractical. This
is the scientific and translational problem we address in the proposed ST-Analytics U54.
The ST-Analytics U54 center is populated by leading scientists at the ISB, the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine,
and Yale, and is comprised of two research projects and two research cores, with each project integrating both
state-of-the-art experimentation and computational work. This structure is further designed to bring together the
scientific, experimental, and computational and administrative resources to develop a data base that captures
the kinetics of lead-in monotherapy tumor priming, and apply that data base to the development of predictive in
silico models that can inform the design of such targeted inhibitor – immunotherapy sequence combinations for
clinical trials. This requires close integration and cycles of iteration between of state-of-the-art experimentation,
leading edge computation, and realistic disease models, continuously calibrated through the analysis of highly
relevant, biopsied patient tumors. The resulting science also provides exciting opportunities for high impact
STEM outreach. We propose to act on those opportunities by leveraging a long-standing systems education
outreach program at ISB that already has impacted K-12 STEM education in all 50 states, and places an
emphasis on those communities that have been historically under-represented in STEM."

10756092,"Project Summary/Abstract
Plasmodium vivax is the second leading cause of malaria and the most prevalent cause of malaria outside of
Africa. The estimated cost of the global burden of vivax malaria is $1.4 - $4 billion per year and more people
live at risk worldwide from P. vivax than P. falciparum. It is endemic mostly in poor countries where access to
affordable health care is lacking, which leads to lost adult productivity. Relapse infections from P. vivax
poses a special challenge to malaria elimination and eradication because of its ability to repeatedly restart
blood-stage infections from hypnozoites – the dormant parasite that can persist in human livers from weeks
to years after the sporozoite infection. Exacerbating the problem, P. vivax transmission occurs prior to onset
of clinical signs and treatment options to clear relapsing parasites in the dormant liver stage are limited. The
goal of this U01 project is to accelerate vivax malaria vaccine development by validation of an optimal
combination of P. vivax target antigens in pre-erythrocytic stages. Our vaccine strategy seeks to validate
candidate antigens that together can effectively inhibit sporozoite infection and block liver stage
development, including blood stage breakthrough infection. Our strategy exploits our new in vitro functional
assay for experimental studies of liver stage development of P. vivax. We will pursue a structural vaccinology
approach, using broadly neutralizing binding inhibitory antisera and monoclonal antibodies to identify and
characterize the highest value immunogens and vaccine delivery method to design a multivalent vaccine to
prevent and eliminate vivax malaria."
10771141,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States among both men and women. If
lung nodules can be detected with greater reliability at an early stage, significant improvements in survival rate
would be achievable. Chest radiographs are among the most common diagnostic tool used in radiology, and
can reveal unexpected incidences of lung cancer. However, even expert radiologists may fail to detect the
presence of a subtle low-contrast pulmonary nodule against the high-contrast anatomical background of a
chest X-ray, with estimated rates of missed detection of 20-30%. What are the perceptual mechanisms,
cognitive mechanisms, and critical learning experiences that determine how well a person can perform this
challenging task of lung nodule detection? The PI and Co-Investigator have formed a synergistic collaboration
that brings together expertise in human vision, computational modeling and neuroscience (Dr. Tong) in concert
with thoracic imaging and biomedical engineering (Dr. Donnelly) to address this longstanding problem with high
clinical relevance. This project will develop a validated computational approach for generating a diverse set of
visually realistic simulated nodules to achieve the following goals. These are: 1) to characterize radiologist
performance on an image-by-image basis in an ecologically valid manner, 2) to develop a novel image-
computable model that accounts for expert performance, and 3) to develop a novel learning-based paradigm to
characterize the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms of nodule detection, initially in non-expert participants,
with the long-term goal of developing a protocol to enhance clinical training. The project will incorporate
sophisticated 2D image-based computational methods as well as data from 3D CT segmented nodules to
generate a diverse set of simulated nodule examples, each placed in a unique chest X-ray. Success will be
evaluated by the following outcome measures. First, radiologists should find it very difficult to tell apart real
from simulated nodules. Moreover, their performance accuracy at detecting/localizing simulated nodules
should be predictive of their accuracy for real nodules. Second, if the simulated nodules suitably capture the
variations of real nodule appearance, then non-expert participants who receive multiple sessions of training
with simulated nodules should show improved performance for both simulated and real nodules. This learning-
based paradigm will allow for characterization of the perceptual, cognitive, and learning-based factors that
govern nodule detection performance. Third, development and refinement of this learning-based paradigm
should have the potential to improve nodule detection performance in radiology residents. Finally, the
behavioral data gathered from radiologists and other top-performing participants will be used to develop an
image-computable model of nodule detection performance. As a whole, this project will lead to a more rigorous
understanding of the perceptual and cognitive bases of lung nodule detection, and spur the development of a
new learning-based protocol to enhance the training of radiology residents and other medical professionals."

The overall goal of CAP-IT Center for RNA Immunoprevention (CRI) is to pre-clinically delineate, formulate and
validate liponanoparticle RNA (LNP RNA) vaccines for precision prevention of individuals with increased cancer
risk. The PI is Dr. Lipkin, an established leader in Cancer Prevention who has made several important, clinically
translated contributions to the field. Project 1 will develop and validate an LNP RNA immunoprevention vaccine
for Lynch syndrome, a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome with highly immunogenic recurrent neoantigens
shared among cancers from different patients. Project 2 will develop and validate an LNP RNA immune
interception vaccine for patients with lung non-solid nodule (NSN) pre-malignant neoplasms, a lung
adenocarcinoma precursor lesion. To achieve these goals, we will use state-of-the-art technologies, including
LNP RNA vaccine formulation, computational genomic tumor immunology, spatial genomics and
immunopeptidomics. To ensure CRI's scientific rigor and excellence, we have assembled a scientifically
outstanding CRI External Advisory Board (EAB), which includes 2021 Lasker Award winner Drew Weissman
(Penn) for his work on LNP RNA COVID19 vaccines. Overall, the CAP-IT CRI will develop state-of-the-art LNP RNA
immunoprevention and immune interception vaccines and provide a technologically powerful platform to
jumpstart additional CAP-IT CRI LNP RNA vaccine projects. We anticipate that CAP-IT CRI will propel both
Lynch syndrome and lung NSN vaccines to NCI PREVENT and CP-NET clinical trials within the next 5 years
and FDA approval/clinical translation within ten years."
10773204,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goals of this K01 Mentored Career Development Award are to understand how young adults’ (age
18-25) social media use affects their nicotine vaping and to identify intervention targets that mitigate social
media’s impact on vaping. Prevalence of vaping and social media use among young adults have increased in
tandem. Exposure to vaping-related social media content is common and is associated with vaping. Intense
social media use appears to contribute to young adults’ increased mental health symptoms, which are linked to
tobacco product use. This project aims to contribute to scientific understanding of the causal links between
social media use and vaping in young adulthood and to explore solutions to reduce young adults’ vaping and
improve their mental health. In Study 1, young adults with past-month vaping will report time spent on social
media, vaping-related social media content exposure, social comparison on social media, mental health, and
vaping behavior. After a 1-month baseline measurement period, they will be randomized to reduce their social
media use (incentivized) or use social media as usual for a 3-month experimental period. Longitudinal within-
and between-subjects analyses will test relationships between time spent on social media, risk factors for
vaping, and vaping behavior. In Study 2, young adults will participate in focus groups exploring intervention
strategies for reducing social media use and vaping and improving their mental health. Potential intervention
targets will include any significant risk factors for vaping identified in Study 1. Specific research aims are to: (1)
investigate the relationships between a reduction in social media use and: a) vaping content exposure, b)
social comparison, and c) mental health; (2) examine whether reducing social media use reduces past-month
vaping days, vaping episodes per vaping day, and puffs per vaping episode; and (3) explore digital intervention
strategies for reducing young adults’ social media use and vaping. At the University of Southern California, the
candidate will pursue the following training aims: (1) to develop expertise in young adults’ behavioral health; (2)
to learn and employ longitudinal statistical modeling to analyze relationships between social media activity,
vaping, and mental health; and (3) to use qualitative data to inform the development of health behavior
intervention strategies in a digital context. This project will support the candidate’s development as an
independent investigator with expertise in digital and behavioral health."

Time is a problem for biologists, especially for those interested in cancer, stem cell, and developmental
biology. Whereas cellular processes occur in real time, we most often try to understand biology by piecing
together information obtained with static end-point experiments. The goal of this proposal is to expand a novel
technology to provide innovative of dealing with problems posed by time in biology. The technology records a
ledger of events within the cell’s own genome with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tools, which have been
developed to execute machine-like instructions in cells. The ledger can be “read” by next generation DNA
sequencing, allowing the reading many ledger entries at one time at once. The presence of multiple ledger
entries on a contiguous DNA strand enables all the entries from many cells to be read at the individual cell
level. The system of recording is based on combining multiple modular activities in series to develop a
cascading process through sequentially activated steps; each step is encoded by a single module. We have
developed and validated the essential components of individual modules, and here we propose to build and
optimize series of modules linked together in pre-programmed orders. The proposed research is organized by
three Specific Aims of 1) expanding the duration of stem cell lineage tracking with a 10-module long cascade,
2) record the history of Wnt signaling in individual cells in a lineage using our technology, and 3) control a
ratcheting progression of cellular recording such that cellular events can be identified with a cell division
number tracker. Completion of the proposal will provide a substantial new capability for biologists in
interrogating the functions of biological systems."
10797025,"The primary function of the Biospecimen Core (BioCore) is to provide investigators of the Alcohol Center of
Research-Nebraska (ACORN) key support for the novel alcohol exposome projects and their significant
contributions to the field. The BioCore will provide expert assistance for the design of translational models and
a centralized mechanism for animal and human sample accrual. The BioCore will ensure standardization of
sample preparation and integrity; uniformity of protocols and procedures; and data collection, reporting and
sharing. At a minimum, the well-governed and supported BioCore will bank and distribute animal and human
samples for all four of the ACORN projects. Additionally, project milestones and deliverables will be
significantly supported through a searchable online inventory, annotated sample characteristics, and the
coordination and dissemination of available resources and collaborative support. Further, the BioCore will
facilitate educational seminars, training, and collaborative opportunities with local and national resources to aid
in the success of the alcohol exposome projects and future strategies."
10797030,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has an array of
liver pathologies that ranges from simple fatty liver to more severe forms of liver injury such as steatohepatitis,
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Many extrahepatic factors including genetics, gender, lifestyle (diet
and exercise) and exposures to viral infections determine the disease phenotype and outcome. Equally
important in ALD pathogenesis and progression is the associated dysfunction of other organs. It is now well-
documented that the alcohol-induced changes in the gut microbiota and disruption of the intestinal barrier
integrity resulting in the increased translocation of bacterial-derived byproducts into the portal-hepatic
circulation plays a crucial pathogenic role in ALD progression. In adipose tissue, chronic ethanol consumption
enhances lipolysis, impairs insulin-activated glucose uptake, reduces secretion of protective adipokines, and
enhances release of pro-inflammatory mediators, all of which contribute to ALD pathogenesis.
Aging is a predominant risk factor for the development of advanced chronic liver diseases. Emerging evidence
indicates that advanced age is associated with alterations to the hepatic structure and impairment of cellular
functions. There are also aging-related detrimental changes in adipose tissue as well as in the composition/
stability of gut microbiota and barrier integrity. Many of these aging-related alterations in the elderly resemble
ethanol-induced defects in the liver, adipose and gut organ systems.
Based on these considerations we hypothesize that aging-related structural and functional changes in the
gastrointestinal tract, adipose and liver in older subjects promote a faster progression of ALD than in
younger subjects. Here, we propose to conduct an in-depth study to examine the effect of aging on ALD
severity. This study is warranted given the upward trend for heavy drinking among the elderly and the global
expansion in the aging population which is predicted to double to over 1.5 billion persons by 2050.
To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Examine the aging-related structural and functional changes in the gastrointestinal tract,
 adipose and liver of ethanol-fed rodents
Specific Aim 2: Gain mechanistic insight into how ethanol administration to older and younger animals for
 the same duration generates more severe liver injury in older subjects
Specific Aim 3: Identify and analyze aging-related changes in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease
 in relation to the severity of liver disease"

The Scripps Research Institute-Alcohol Research Center (TSRI-ARC) will focus on the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that modulate top-down medial prefrontal control of the central amygdala and underlie stress-
induced vulnerability to relapse and excessive drinking during protracted abstinence. Our approach consists of
coordinated interdisciplinary molecular, neuroproteomic, cellular, neurocircuitry, connectomic,
neuropharmacological, and behavioral methods. Specific hypotheses are: (1) Protracted abstinence involves
increased vulnerability to stress-induced relapse via changes in modulatory control circuitry from the infralimbic
cortex to the central nucleus of the amygdala. (2) Modulatory control changes are a function of altered
glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid synaptic transmission, due to actions of stress-related molecules
(including hypocretin, corticotropin-releasing factor, dynorphin, and nociceptin) and astrocytic dysfunction. (3)
These neurocircuitry changes are associated with altered connectivity and decreased modularity of brain
networks, leading to increased vulnerability to stress-induced relapse. (4) Novel translationally relevant ligands
of neurobiological targets identified by TSRI-ARC will attenuate the reinstatement of stress-induced alcohol
seeking, excessive drinking, and stress-related behaviors in animal models. Our Center-wide aims will be met
by 5 Research Components (Functional Connectomics, Neuropharmacology, Molecular, Neurophysiology, and
Neurocircuitry), and 4 Cores (Administrative, Dissemination, Animal Models, and Neuroproteomics). The
Administrative Core is organized to optimize Center-wide functioning, utilization of Core resources, and research
collaborations in the Center-at-Large. TSRI-ARC is structured to promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI),
training and career development at all levels of the Center. TSRI-ARC rapidly disseminates its discoveries to
scientific, healthcare and lay stakeholders, and engages young people from health disparity backgrounds for
internships in TSRI-ARC laboratories to learn about alcohol and careers in alcohol research. Center-wide
Specific Aims are: (1) To characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate top-down medial
prefrontal control of the central amygdala and underlie stress-induced vulnerability to relapse and excessive
drinking during protracted abstinence. (2) To understand how reversal of the cellular and molecular stress
mechanisms that impair modulatory control systems can prevent stress-induced relapse and excessive drinking
during protracted abstinence. (3) To evaluate the efficacy of neuropharmacological targets identified by TSRI-
ARC for reversing dysregulated connectivity within and between brain stress systems and modulatory control
circuits in protracted abstinence. The ultimate goal of TSRI-ARC is to positively influence public health by
generating data relevant to the identification of neurobiological mechanisms mediating alcohol use disorder
(AUD), and guide the translation of our basic research findings toward clinical applications to help in prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of individuals with AUD."

across 5 Research Components (Functional Connectomics, Neuropharmacology, Molecular, Neurophysiology,
and Neurocircuitry), and 3 Cores (Dissemination, Animal Models, and Neuroproteomics). Specific Aims are: (1)
Provide scientific and administrative leadership for TSRI-ARC Cores and Research Components to
function in an optimal and synergistic manner. The Center Director chairs monthly meetings of the Steering
Committee which is comprised of all Project Leads, and with the help of the Scientific Director and Deputy
Scientific Director, monitors progress and outcomes of all projects, develops new collaborations, and identifies
problems and proposes fair solutions. A Program Advisory Committee comprised of five external experts in
domains relevant to TSRI-ARC will meet annually to review progress and make recommendations to the Director.
The Director implements course corrections and the reprioritization of resources when indicated, and dynamically
manages expenditures to bolster TSRI-ARC aims. (2) Facilitate the dissemination of expertise between
Cores and Research Components and the utilization of Core resources. Cores provide systematic
prioritization of resources and standardized methods that foster integration of projects. Rapid dissemination and
utilization of Core expertise (e.g., new animal models, biochemical analyses, single-cell proteomics analysis
techniques, and functional neurocircuitry mapping techniques) are accomplished by monthly Steering Committee
meetings and monthly Center-at-Large scientific seminars. Requests for Core services are submitted (and data
archived) on the TSRI-ARC website, providing transparency of Core operations and facilitating ongoing review
of the Cores’ efficiency by the Steering Committee. (3) Provide scientific enrichment for TSRI-ARC and
disseminate TSRI-ARC research. The Administrative Core will organize monthly scientific seminars to
stimulate collaborations and scientific enrichment throughout the Center-at-Large. Seminars include a
presentation by a project Lead on recent progress, or an invited lecturer on research relevant to TSRI-ARC’s
scientific interests, in tandem with 1:1 meetings with investigators. TSRI-ARC will host an annual Scientific
Retreat on the TSRI campus, consisting of a poster session, a data blitz, and presentations by TSRI-ARC and
Center-at-Large investigators, T32 postdoctoral trainees, and interns. TSRI-ARC discoveries are shared with
scientific, healthcare and lay stakeholders via scientific publications and presentations, our website and social

10757663,"Dissemination Core Abstract
The goals of the Dissemination Core are to educate higher risk young people about alcohol use disorder while
also tackling health disparities by increasing representation of minorities in biomedical science. To achieve these
goals, we will create a virtual internship program targeted toward high school students from health disparity
populations (these populations are also under-represented in STEM fields, i.e. URM) and expand our in-person
internship opportunities, increase post-doctoral trainee involvement in outreach and better utilize social media to
highlight both our scientific accomplishments and outreach efforts, and create an Alcohol Research Center
(ARC) & NIAAA Training Grant (T32) trainee and intern diversity-related club and annual poster session. Our
virtual internship program will serve to educate our interns on the neuroscience of alcohol use, abuse and
dependence using ARC laboratory examples and empower them to pursue scientific careers by encouraging
their sense of identity and belonging, by promoting agency and leadership, and by educating them about career
pathways. In-person interns will be encouraged to participate in these lessons and discussions. ARC and T32
post-doctoral trainees will lecture and mentor within the virtual internship program, give lectures to high school
and undergraduate students, present in university community center settings, and contribute to our social media.
Our ARC Diversity group and end-of-summer poster sessions will allow the interns to learn about each other’s
work, practice presenting science, interact with each other, and connect with our trainees and investigators to
foster mentee/mentor relationships. Health disparities are extremely problematic and addressing them
represents a key goal of NIAAA. This core has the goal of targeting URM in STEM research both for education
regarding health disparities as well as to increase their representation in biomedical science and medicine. This
will be a valuable resource for ARC labs as it will help recruit URM into our labs. It has been shown that diversity
enhances problem solving and innovation as well as increasing publication impact and citations."

SUMMARY
The advent of cancer immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized clinical
care in multiple solid tumor types and demonstrated the power of the immune system to target and eliminate
cancer cells. Despite these breakthroughs, the efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy is limited to a subset of
cancers, and even in tumors where ICB is now the standard of care, only a fraction of patients achieve durable
complete responses. Addressing these limitations requires (1) improving our fundamental understanding of
tumor-immune interactions in immunological contexts where current immunotherapies fail and (2) developing
novel strategies for enhancing responses in contexts where they have only partial success. The Center for
Tumor-Immune Systems Biology at MSKCC has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of leading investigators
in computational biology, immunology, and cancer biology to tackle these challenges. The Center is organized
around three Research Projects that integrate computational and experimental studies in mouse models and
molecular analyses in patient tumors in both immunotherapy-resistant and -responsive contexts, exploiting novel
machine learning modeling of single-cell multiome, highly multiplexed optical imaging using confocal
immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomic data sets. We will investigate distinct immune
microenvironments where cancers are refractory to ICB: metastatic colonization of the brain, an immune-
privileged organ where the interplay of cancer cells, astrocytes, and different states of disease-associated
microglia dictate modes of invasion (Project I); and mismatch-repair proficient primary colon cancer, where
tumors reside in a tolerizing microenvironment and interact with complex cellular circuits of regulatory and
conventional T cells, together with metastases to the lymph node and liver (Project II). We will also carry out a
systems biology interrogation of cancer cell death mechanisms in models of ICB-responsive melanoma and
renal cell carcinoma, based on findings that engineering mitochondrial damage-dependent but caspase-
independent cell death elicits anti-cancer immunity and protection against tumor rechallenge (Project III). A
Shared Resource Core will interact with all three Research Projects to develop computational methods and
establish technologies for spatial analyses of the tumor-immune microenvironment. These studies will advance
our fundamental understanding of tumor-immune ecosystems in ICB-refractory microenvironments and of
immune responses to therapeutically induced immunogenic cancer cell death in ICB-responsive settings,
ultimately leading to novel immunotherapeutic targets and combination strategies. Our team will build on the
successes of our previous CSBC U54 Center award for the Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,

10757691,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder marked by lasting vulnerability to relapse due to
persistent experience of negative emotional protracted abstinence symptoms and related impairments in
inhibitory control over alcohol use behavior. Neurobiological understanding of and novel treatments that target
these protracted abstinence sequalae are needed to impact AUD relapse. Data from our ARC suggest a novel
hypothesis that relapse risk is increased by chronic ethanol-induced imbalance between cortical stress and anti-
stress systems in the infralimbic cortex (IL) that impair “top-down” control over the central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeA), leading to negative affective dysregulation and compulsive-like, recurrent alcohol use. The
Zorrilla Neurocircuitry component, in collaboration with our ARC colleagues, tests this hypothesis in 3 aims.
Aim 1 uses retro-DREADD manipulation to test the hypotheses that activity of the IL-CeA projection
bidirectionally modifies stress-induced relapse to alcohol-seeking, drinking in risky contexts and in response to
frustrative reward omission, and irritability-like behavior. Aim 2 will use systemic and intra-IL brain-site specific
administration of translatable small molecule nociceptin opioid peptide (NOP) receptor ligands and a short-acting
kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist to test their effects on the increased stress-induced relapse, drinking
and irritability of post-dependent CIE rats. Aim 3 uses targeted and unbiased retrograde CAV2-Cre circuit-
defined proteomic analysis in STOPflox-MetRS* mice to identify altered expression and post-translational
modification of proteins in CeA-projecting IL neurons, by labeling nascent proteins produced during abstinence
with the methionine surrogate azido-nor-leucine (ANL). The collaborative studies with each ARC research
Component and Core seek to determine the causal role of the IL-CeA projection in stress relapse, drinking and
affective dysregulation during protracted abstinence. They also aim to provide translatable insight into the
systemic and IL role of KOR and NOP receptor systems with mechanistic neurophysiologic and whole-brain
network insight. Finally, they may refine or discover new molecular targets in this key stress-related cortico-
amygdalar projection linked to compulsive drinking and AUD relapse under stress and distress."
10748294,"Nearly 50% of American adults over age 30 have periodontal disease (PD). The basic pathology of PD
is excessive alveolar bone resorption leading to tooth loss. Furthermore, PD can trigger general inflammation,
adversely influencing cardiovascular, central nervous, reproductive and endocrine systems. Our laboratory has
explored a variety of strategies for treating this disease and is still actively searching for a more effective and
practical therapy with minimal side effects to cure the disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of
non-protein-coding transcripts with the length longer than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs participate in a wide
repertoire of biological processes and play important roles in gene expression and posttranscriptional processes
and are also implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. However, the functions of lncRNAs in dental
diseases are just beginning to be uncovered. LncRNA ANRIL was the first shared genetic risk factor of
atherosclerosis, PD, diabetes and cancers, thereby coined to APCD. Our laboratory has performed extensive
preliminary studies including studies on lncRNA-APDC knockout mice. Our hypothesis is that lncR-APDC
inhibits inflammation, osteoclastic bone resorption and promotes osteogenesis and alveolar bone regeneration
through specific epigenetic pathways, by which efficiently targeting the pathophysiology of periodontitis. Aim 1
will determine the functions of lncR-APDC in periodontitis via loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Next
generation RNA-Seq will be performed to elucidate the expression patterns of the participating genes and cellular
pathways altered by the lncRNA dysregulation. Aim 2 will use state-of-the-art techniques to determine the
cellular localization of lncR-APDC and decipher the mechanisms by characterizing the protein and RNA binding
partners and chromosomal regions regulated by the lncR-APDC. Aim 3 will test the therapeutic effects of lncR-
APDC in periodontitis to determine lncR-APDC’s effect on inflammation, osteoclastic bone resorption and
alveolar bone regeneration. The results will provide a paradigm shift and advance the research field vertically in
three ways. Firstly, we have initially found that lncR-APDC could play a pivotal role in cell differentiation and
proliferation in PD. However, how this lncRNA is involved in PD progression is virtually unknown. Therefore, the
results will reveal a novel pathological mechanism of PD deterioration and progression. Secondly, we will
decipher the pathways of lncR-APDC modulating gene clusters in different cells playing active roles in the
periodontal microenvironment and their roles in the PD progression, which will lead to the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets. Finally, we will examine the potential utility of our newly constructed adenovirus conjugated
lncR-APDC, as a safe and effective therapeutic measure for PD in dental clinics. An interdisciplinary team of
investigators with complementary and synergistic skills will conduct the studies (Jake Chen – Experimental Oral
Pathology and Bone Biology; Qisheng Tu – Cell and Molecular Biology; Thomas Van Dyke – Periodontology
and RNA-Sequencing; Hans Johansson – RNA Biology and lncRNA FISH)."
10741761,"Abstract
Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but
clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may
even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of
postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of
polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best
dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used
one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly
individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized
to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all
Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to
minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus
(hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE).
Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe
between group differences in HbA1c, β-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also
will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation,
Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out-
of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in β-
cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing,
the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition
for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease
progression in those with early-stage T2D."
10737618,"ABSTRACT
Proper regulation of histone biosynthesis during the cell cycle is critical for coordinating
chromatin assembly and DNA replication. Overproduction or underproduction of histone
protein results in replication stress and genome instability that contributes to the
development of cancer. In this proposal, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of
replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNA biosynthesis and how this process is
regulated during the cell cycle in the context of animal development. RD-histone mRNAs
are the only eukaryotic mRNAs in animal cells that lack a polyA tail, ending instead in a
conserved stem loop structure. In contrast, mRNAs for histone variants such as H3.3
and H2A.Z are encoded by polyadenylated mRNAs that are not cell cycle regulated.
Generation of the unique RD-histone mRNA 3’ end results from the activity of an
evolutionary conserved set of pre-RNA processing factors. The genes encoding all five
RD-histone proteins are clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-
mRNA processing factors required for histone mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a
nuclear body (the histone locus body or HLB) that assembles at these gene clusters. We
will determine the requirements for the coordinate synthesis of the RD-histone mRNAs
using both biochemical and genetic approaches in Drosophila, with a particular focus on
the role that the HLB plays in histone transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Histone
gene clusters provide a system in which one can readily study the expression of a tightly
regulated set of genes at all levels of mRNA biosynthesis, from the organization of
genes within the nucleus through activation of transcription, pre-mRNA processing and
transcription termination. Our Drosophila experimental paradigm permits the in vivo
interrogation of these fundamental processes in gene expression in ways that are
unavailable in other experimental systems."

Cocaine use disorder is a complexly determined, heritable trait that imposes significant harm on those afflicted
and on society. Discovery of the genetic factors that influence cocaine use disorder risk is imperative for a
comprehensive understanding of cocaine addiction neurobiology. In an ongoing study, we have characterized
a large panel of inbred mouse lines for voluntary cocaine self-administration (IVSA). We are utilizing this
approach to identify genes and allelic variants that influence cocaine self-administration, including Neuron-
navigator-1 (Nav1), which has emerged as a candidate gene from our genetic analyses. Furthermore, inbred
reference strains in the HMDP that are predisposed to take large amounts of cocaine represent polygenic
models of extreme cocaine use and can be used to understand how risk variants collectively impact
neurobiology to ultimately affect cocaine self-administration. The project proposed here will directly investigate
the polygenic and single gene impact of genetic risk for extreme cocaine IVSA on mesolimbic dopamine
neurotransmission, a key neurobiological function impacted by cocaine and other drugs of abuse. This project
will provide training in fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and fiber photometry and will allow me to
create a unique niche in addiction neurogenetics research. Aim 1 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk
for extreme cocaine IVSA on dopamine neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shell after acute
application of cocaine. This aim may reveal genetic influences on basal and acute dopamine responses that
underlie risk for dysregulated cocaine use. Aim 2 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk for extreme
cocaine IVSA on neuroadaptations in dopamine transmission in the NAc following chronic cocaine IVSA
exposure. This aim may reveal genetically determined adaptations of dopamine transmission that underlie
escalated use after chronic exposure. Aim 3 will evaluate the causal effects of experimental changes in Nav1
expression on dopamine transmission at the single-gene level. This project will advance understanding of how
genetics intersect with neurobiology to affect cocaine use. The training I will receive in conducting this project
will broaden my skill set and allow me to more effectively investigate addiction neurogenetics."

Globally, depression is the leading cause of disability world worldwide, yet over 75% of people in low and
middle-income countries (LMIC) do not receive treatment. This gap is especially large for men. Treating men is
essential to reducing the global burden of depression given its impact on families and children with men’s
mental health (MH) predicting poor parenting and child MH. Although treating parent depression has been
shown to improve parental MH, parenting, and child MH; men and fathers have been missing MH care and
clinical trials. MH care relevant to fathers that address common barriers to MH, such as masculine norms and
economic factors, are needed. The goal of the K23 is to expand the candidate’s skillset and prepare her to
conduct independent research on scalable interventions for adult MH to improve child MH in low-resource
settings. Through a combination of coursework and seminars, scientific conferences, collaborative
publications, and mentorship from leading experts, the candidate will develop competency in 1) execution of
randomized control trials using implementation science designs; 2) exploration of mechanism of change on MH
using mixed methods; 3) understanding social determinant of health (SDH) on implementation.
 The candidate will apply knowledge and skills gained through training to conduct a pilot randomized
control trial (RCT) using an effectiveness-implementation design in Kenya. The candidate will leverage existing
partnerships with AMPATH and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Kenya. She will also build on
collaborative preliminary work with AMPATH/MTRH that showed promising proof-of-concept for ‘Learn, Act,
Engage, Dedicate’ (LEAD), a 5-session task-shifted behavioral activation intervention with motivational
interviewing and masculinity discussion strategies for fathers in Kenya. Proof-of-concept findings with nine
fathers and families were promising with high participant satisfaction and improvements in father depression,
parenting, and child MH. This supports pursuit of a pilot RCT, proposed here, using an effectiveness-
implementation Hybrid Type I design to explore preliminary effectiveness and its implementation. Specifically,
the candidate will conduct a pilot RCT with fathers randomized to either LEAD or a waitlist control group to
(Aim1) explore change in fathers’ MH; (Aim 2) explore drivers of change in father MH, father parenting, and
child MH (or non-response); and (Aim 3) explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a task-shifted
MH treatment for fathers in a low-resource setting. Results will inform the development of an R01 proposal for
a Hybrid trial to assess clinical outcomes of father and child MH and the impact of implementation strategies.
Together, the training, research, and partnerships in the proposed award will support testing of a scalable MH
treatment delivered by peer-father counselors with potential for engaging men and improving father and child
MH in a low-resource setting, contributing to the NIMH’s goal of maximizing public health impact of research."
10748364,"Accurate assessment of kidney function is fundamental to the care of all patients, but current methods to
estimate GFR have error rates of 35-60% in important populations as well as variable accuracy across race,
ethnicity and geography, leading to errors in critical decisions, drug dosing, and determination of prognosis.
Current GFR estimates include a coefficient for Black vs non-Black which may restrict access to care. As a
result, there are critical knowledge gaps in evaluation and management of GFR in health and disease.
Our goal is to develop a valid and robust GFR estimate optimized for an individual person that meets the
critical unmet need for a confirmatory test. The confirmatory test will use a panel of endogenous filtration
markers to estimate GFR (peGFR) from a single blood sample using an equation that does not require serum
creatinine or demographic characteristics. Our research team has extensive experience in biomarker
evaluation, GFR estimation, epidemiology, laboratory science and metabolomics. Our preliminary data
provide proof of concept that a panel of novel metabolites that does not include serum creatinine or
demographics can eliminate bias and greatly improve precision of GFR estimates in patients with heart failure
and reduced muscle mass; and that novel techniques can be used to produce a high-accuracy and
parsimonious prediction model.
Aim 1 Using global metabolomic discovery (~1000+ metabolites) on five cohorts (N=2583), we will select
candidate metabolites based on maximal joint association with mGFR as well as biological and physiological
assessment of their properties as filtration markers. Markers that show acceptable analytical properties in initial
testing will be incorporated into a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) multiplex
assay. Aim 2: We propose to use a spectrum of novel approaches, such as marginalizing predictions to down-
weight outlier metabolites and kernel nearest neighbor weighted average predictions, to maximize precision as
well as robustness across multiple diverse populations and to compare these approaches to a benchmark
model developed using superlearner ensemble modeling techniques. Development and external validation in
~3036 and ~3465 participants across 8 and 12 studies, respectively. Aim 3: We propose to evaluate the
impact of panel eGFR in patients with heart and liver failure (N=1796) on clinical decisions and outcomes.
The expected outcome is development of panel eGFR that can be used as a confirmatory test and ultimately
incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. The proposal is highly innovative as it is comprehensive
spanning discovery, validation, assessment of clinical utility in populations not previously been studied and use
of novel statistical methods to compute individualized GFR estimates. The proposal is significant because it
will enable generalizable and accurate individualized GFR estimates in health and disease, particularly
diseases with unacceptably GFR estimation high error rates and diverse racial, ethnic and geographic groups."
10757686,"Abstract
The TSRI-ARC and others have identified numerous molecular changes and dysregulations of
specific neuronal circuits, including the extended amygdala, contributing to excessive alcohol
drinking in dependent animals. However, there is considerable evidence that such complex
behavioral states and associated behaviors are encoded throughout the brain in dozens if not a
hundred brain regions. Unfortunately, the functional connectivity of single-cell whole-brain
networks during alcohol abstinence is largely unknown because of technical limitations. The
Functional Connectomics component will bridge this gap using single-cell whole-brain imaging
of immediate-early genes to identify the network mechanisms associated with pharmacological
interventions (Specific Aim 1) and circuit-specific interventions (Specific Aim 2) that decrease
addiction-like behaviors during abstinence. The overarching hypothesis is that FDA-approved
medications and ARC-related experimental compounds candidates for the treatment of alcohol
use disorder normalize network modularity, deactivate the extended amygdala network, and
strengthen the cortical networks. We will also test the hypothesis that manipulations of the
lateral hypothalamus-infralimbic-amygdala pathway shown by other ARC components to
decrease addiction-like behaviors will also increase brain modularity and identify the specific
subnetwork mechanisms associated with these manipulations. The use of advanced
computational network analysis, including graph theory, machine learning frameworks, minimal
network analysis, and advanced network comparisons, will allow us to identify whole-brain
networks that predict behavioral states and identify repetitive patterns of connectomics changes
that predict the therapeutic effects of interventions that decrease addiction-like behavior."
10797021,"The goal of the Alcohol Center of Research-Nebraska (ACORN) is to expand existing strengths and expertise
in Nebraska to develop a novel niche in alcohol research, by creating a Center focused on the Alcohol
Exposome. Alcohol research has been a major area of emphasis in Nebraska (at the Omaha VA Medical
Center Research Service and at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for over 5 decades. As a result,
many contributions to the field of alcohol research and the treatment of alcoholic liver disease have been
made. Studies examining the effects of alcohol on trace metal metabolism, lung biology and physiology,
mechanisms of alcoholic fatty liver, role of aldehyde adducts in alcoholic cell injury, hepatic protein trafficking
and signal transduction events and the role of immune mechanisms in alcoholic liver disease have been some
of the key areas of investigation. Our goal is to translate to humans how factors in the exposome such as age,
nutritional status, cigarette smoking, and exposure to pathogens interact in the presence or absence of alcohol
administration. We know that a major component of the specific external environment is the lifestyle factor of
alcohol consumption. Thus, under the comprehensive schema of the exposome, alcohol represents an
environmental exposure that should be considered in context with other internal and external factors to
understand causes and nature of disease progression. The overall hypothesis of our application is the
following: the examination of alcohol in the context of the exposome will allow us to understand its role
more fully in the etiology of disease and the subsequent manifestations of alcohol-induced human
pathophysiology. The alcohol-exposome theme of the center is unique among alcohol centers and has the
potential to be highly translational. Our investigators represent an outstanding team of interdisciplinary
investigators that will be supported by an Administrative Core, a Biospecimen Core, and a Pilot Projects Core.
ACORN investigators will have access to state-of-the art facilities at UNMC, Nebraska Medical Center and
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. We include faculty from 5 departments and 3 colleges. Our proposed Specific
Aims for the ACORN are to: 1) Facilitate interdisciplinary research and identify factors so that we can translate
in humans how age, nutritional status, cigarette smoking, and exposure to pathogens interact in the presence
or absence of alcohol administration. 2) Create a Biospecimen Core to aid Center investigators in promotion
and development of translational animal and human tissue and cell models. 3) Enhance the collaborative
ACORN environment and provide opportunities for funding through training, symposia, and pilot grants. Work
on our 4 research projects, with participation of the Administration Core and the Biospecimen Core will allow us
to realize our goals. Overall, this new P50 will utilize the expertise and knowledge of past research efforts to
examine how alcohol, in the setting of various external and internal environmental factors will influence disease
in a variety of organs and help us shape our future animal and human studies."

 Biomedical advances in HIV prevention and care, principally pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and
treatment as prevention, led to optimistic predictions and plans to bring HIV under control by 2020. For people
who use drugs (PWUD) in NYC, the US, and abroad, it is unlikely that the WHO 90-90-90 goals (90%
diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed in care, and 90% of those in care virally suppressed) will be met in the near
future. In the US, there have been more than a dozen additional HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs
(PWID) since the sentinel HIV outbreak in Indiana PWID in 2014. In NYC, 64% of PWUD living with HIV are
viremic, and mortality rates in HIV-positive PWID in NYC are twice as high as in sexual minority men and
heterosexuals living with HIV. PrEP uptake among PWUD is very low (0-3% in the US), even in the midst of
outbreaks when it is needed most. After a decade of declines, new HIV diagnoses in US PWID have been
increasing 4% per year since 2012. COVID-19 has increased unemployment, homelessness, and substance
use across the nation, and is threatening gains that have been made toward ending HIV among PWUD.
 Thus, our Center for Drug Use and HIV Research has chosen the theme, “Reinvigorating HIV prevention
and care for people who use drugs: Accelerating progress and sustaining gains in the midst of societal
disruption.” To achieve this, we will lead the field and support our investigators to: 1) understand how large-
scale societal changes may undermine HIV prevention and treatment for PWUD, 2) gain knowledge and skills
to carry out studies that address the specific needs of PWUD at elevated risk of HIV infection, morbidity and
mortality including PWID, sexual minority men, transgender women, and people of color who use drugs, to
reduce persistent and widening disparities, and 3) engage with community members to improve the relevance
and impact of the knowledge generated. We are committed to supporting new and early stage investigators
(new/ESI), especially those who are underrepresented in NIH funding, to achieve their potential as productive
and successful scientists. We will achieve these aims through four Cores – an Administrative Core, the Pilot
Projects and Mentoring Core, and two Research Support Cores – the Infectious Disease Epidemiology and
Social-Behavioral Theory Core, and the Transdisciplinary Research Methods Core. These Cores support our
research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across
investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the
individual projects could have achieved. Our theme and aims build upon many years of research experience
and collaboration, broad methodological and theoretical expertise and innovation, and engagement with
community and public health partners locally, regionally, nationally and internationally."

The Admin Core provides scientific leadership and administrative support to: 1) ensure that the overall aims of
the Center and individual Cores are achieved, 2) enhance the productivity and impact of the studies in the

working in the field of HIV and drug use. The Admin Core also strives to promote a collaborative,
transdisciplinary intellectual environment for the entire CDUHR community. Doing so invites fuller participation,
freer exchange of knowledge and ideas, and more effective responses to urgent public health problems. Three
new initiatives were adopted by the Admin Core. First, a Visiting Scholars program was created that invites
scientists who are expert in studying health disparities in at-risk, vulnerable, and under-served populations to
engage with us so that our investigators may learn from and potentially collaborate with them. Second, a new
Community Coalition will advise the Center and our investigators regarding community concerns, research
questions, and best practices for conducting studies with vulnerable populations. Third, the Admin Core will
prioritize more frequent and timely evaluation of Center activities in order to keep up with our investigators’
changing needs. Altogether, we believe that carrying forward our tried and tested approaches while routinely
updating and improving how the Center functions will ensure that we achieve the Center’s aims. The specific
aims of the Admin Core are to: 1) Ensure that the Center continues to serve as a resource to the field,
including investigators, policy makers, and service providers and actively seek new ways that the Center can
serve as a resource; 2) Provide scientific leadership and ensure integration and synergy across Cores by a)
fostering transdisciplinary collaborations to reinvigorate HIV prevention and care for PWUD through Center
activities that promote discussions of new ideas, such as emerging and ongoing Big Events and Trends
(BE/BT), innovative and rigorous research methods, and high priority research questions and b) provide
centralized resources for project activities and assisting with regulatory requirements to promote project
efficiencies, and adapt to an evolving research environment that may be shaped by BE/BT; 3) Collaborate with

Acquired and inherited diseases of myelin are the major cause of non-traumatic neurological
disability in young adults in the USA. Studies have also described myelin pathology in brains
from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
myelin protein gene alleles are risk factors for schizophrenia, depression, and autism. In
addition to its insulating properties, therefore, myelin has multiple effects on neuronal function. It
is now accepted that axonal and neuronal degeneration cause permanent neurological disability
in individuals with primary myelin disease. My laboratory played a significant role in identifying
axonal and neuronal degeneration in brains from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), an
inflammatory demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system (CNS). We leveraged
these data to develop animal models that recapitulate mechanistic aspects of myelin-induced
axonal and neuronal degeneration. The purpose of the present proposal is to consolidate three
NINDS R01s that investigate mechanisms of myelin-induced neurodegeneration. We will
address three key questions. 1) How does myelin provide trophic support to axons? We
propose that transfer of ATP substrates is the major mechanism by which myelin provides
trophic support to axons. Disruption of this metabolic coupling in inherited myelin diseases
induces mitochondrial pathology/degeneration in paranodal axoplasm, which causes axonal
degeneration. 2) How does demyelination affect neurons and their synaptic connections? We
propose that demyelination alters neuronal gene expression, modulates dendritic structure, and
reduces neuronal viability; we further propose that remyelination will reverse these changes. 3)
How does subpial cortical demyelination occur? We propose that subpial demyelination occurs
by mechanisms that differ from immune-mediated mechanisms that demyelinate white matter
and that novel therapies are needed to prevent subpial demyelination. The biggest challenge
facing the myelin research community is the development of neuroprotective therapies. R35
funding will consolidate our efforts to identify new therapeutic targets that cause axonal and
neuronal degeneration in myelin diseases. This is essential for the development of
neuroprotective therapies that delay and possibly reverse permanent neurological disability in
individuals with myelin disease."

Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear a disproportionate burden of the global HIV epidemic. Conducting
studies in the most affected areas of the world is critical to the international HIV research agenda. The Johns
Hopkins University-Blantyre, Malawi Clinical Trials Unit (JHU Blantyre-CTU) and its clinical research site (CRS)
in Malawi, located in one of the most affected regions of the world, propose to continue and expand high-
impact research collaborations with four NIAID Clinical Research Networks in order to prevent, treat, manage
and potentially cure HIV and AIDS in adults, key populations, and children. With more than 30 years of HIV
research experience and the strong backing of the host institutions (Johns Hopkins University and College of
Medicine, University of Malawi), the CTU and CRS leadership will be responsible for the conduct and
management of clinical trials at the Blantyre, CRS in accordance with the Research Networks and NIAID
policies. The CTU aims to advance the scientific agenda of the proposed Clinical Research Networks for HIV
prevention, treatment and vaccine research among adults and children by generating hypotheses and
developing new scientific concepts; continuing implementation of active study protocols at the Blantyre CRS
under the current CTU; making available the efficient and flexible local research infrastructure to quickly
respond to emerging needs of the Networks; and by engaging protocol-specific populations. The CTU will
emphasize quality, oversight, cohesiveness and efficiency in all operations as it works to achieve these aims.
During the current CTU cycle (2013 to present), the Blantyre CRS has been involved in 35 studies at various
stages, from initiation to completion, for four existing Division of AIDS/NIAID Clinical Research Networks. The
CRS has established effective institutional and community collaborations and has been responsive to both the
Network agendas and the national health research agenda for Malawi. The goal of this application is to
describe scientific, leadership and administrative strengths of the proposed JHU-Blantyre CTU and its CRS in
Blantyre, Malawi, which will ensure successful implementation of the NIAID international clinical research
agenda. The sub-sections (A-L) of this application provide a scientific overview of the proposed CTU and
describe its administrative and financial management structures; plans for communication, evaluation and
training; and the roles, responsibilities and resources of each CTU element and CRS technical department,
including community engagement, pharmacy, laboratory, quality and regulatory assurance, and data
management. Our CTU arrangement that encompasses a single CRS has demonstrated capacity and
promotes efficiency."
10740878,"Stroke remains a leading cause of death and morbidity in the USA and lacks effective therapeutic
interventions. Redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction are considered as leading causes of cell death
in stroke. Identification of novel therapeutic targets that restore redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function,
and cell survival is a critical need. Deregulation in peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) is one of the mechanisms leading
to redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction. PRDXs act as double-edged swards that the highly
neuroprotective when inside the cells in reduced forms. However, when oxidized and released from
damaged/dead cells, PRDXs can lead to secondary cell death signaling via inflammatory responses.
Therefore, the regulation of PRDXs in stroke is a vital neuroprotective strategy. We identified that regulation
of PRDXs by SULT4a1 (relatively less studies neuronal protein) is a critical neuroprotective function of
SULT4a1 and may have a vital neuroprotective role in stroke. Loss of SULT4a1 in mouse neurons leads to
the accumulation of oxidized PRDXs with subsequent redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell
death. SULT4a1 can interact with PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX3, and PRDX5. These PRDXS (cytosolic-PRDX1
and PRDX2, and mitochondrial-PRDX3 and PRDX5) are crucial for cytosolic and mitochondrial redox
homeostasis via detoxification of peroxides. During this process, PRDXs are oxidized and must be recycled
back to reduced forms. Expression of SULT4a1 increases the levels of reduced PRDXs in peroxide-treated
cells. SULT4a1 protein levels decrease in stroke via the ubiquitin proteasomal system. However, the role of
SULT4a1 in stroke or the mediators that lead to loss of SULT4a1 in stroke are not known. We will use oxygen-
glucose deprivation in mouse cortical neurons and a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke
in mice to identify the neuroprotective roles of SULT4a1 in stroke. We propose the following four aims to study
the role of SULT4a1 in stroke:
Specific Aim #1: Can SULT4a1 maintain redox homeostasis via PRDXs in stroke?
Specific Aim #2: Can SULT4a1 rescue mitochondrial function in stroke?
Specific Aim #3: Is SULT4a1 neuroprotective in stroke?
Specific Aim #4: Identify the mechanisms leading to loss of SULT4a1 in stroke
Our supporting data strongly favor our hypothesis and the proposed aims. Combining viral-mediated
expression of SULT4a1 with Seahorse Flux analysis, electron microscope imaging, proximity ligation assays,
proximity-dependent biotin identification, live-cell imaging, and MRI imaging in experimental models of stroke
represents a novel approaches to identify the neuroprotection by SULT4a1 in stroke. These studies will reveal
essential knowledge about the role of the novel SULT4a1-dependent pathways in stroke, and determine
whether SULT4a1 can represent a credible target for therapeutic intervention in stroke."

 Medulloblastoma (MB) is a pediatric brain tumor arising from the cerebellum. MB treatment is challenging
due to diverse genetic make-up, resistance to chemotherapy, inefficient drug transport across the blood brain
barrier (BBB) and drug induced neurotoxicity. Hedgehog (Hh) and IGF/PI3K signaling pathways regulate cell
growth, cancer stem cell (CSC) proliferation, and tumorigenicity in MB patients. Hh inhibitors are effective
initially to treat SHH-MB, but their repeated use develops chemoresistance due to mutations in SMOothened
(SMO) but can be overcome by modulating GLI, which is downstream of SMO using SF2523, which is a
BRD4/PI3K dual inhibitor and inhibits MYCN expression. In our preliminary studies, we synthesize SMO
inhibitor 2-chloro-N1-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl) phenyl]-N4, N4-bis (2-pyridinyl methyl)-1, 4-benzene-
dicarboxamide (MDB5). MDB5 and SF2523 effectively inhibited the proliferation of ONS-76 and HD-MB03
cells in a dose dependent manner, with significantly higher cell killing when these drugs were used in
combination. Treatment of HD-MB03 cells with the combination of these two drugs showed significantly higher
decrease in colony formation and cyclin D1 expression but higher increase in Bax expression, compared to
individual drugs. We synthesized mPEG-b-PCC-g-DC copolymer, with 5.1±0.21 and 6.5±0.1% loading for
MDB5 and SF2523 when formulated into nanoparticles (NPs). There was sustained drug release from NPs,
wherein 100% of MDB5 was released in 50 h, but only 60% of SF2523 was released in 80 h. Targeted NPs were
prepared by mixing COG-133-PEG-b-PCC-g-DC and mPEG-b-PCC-g-DC at 10/90, 20/80 and 30/70 ratios, with
the highest cellular uptake at 30/70 ratio. Systemic administration of COG-133-NPs loaded SF2523 into
orthotopic SHH-MB tumor bearing NSG mice resulted in significantly higher drug concentration in the brain at
6 and 24h post administration compared to non-targeted NPs loaded with this drug while systemic injection of
free drug showed negligible drug concentration in the brain. Moreover, systemic administration of COG-133-NPs
loaded with MDB5 and SF2523 resulted in decreased tumor burden compared to non-targeted NPs of MDB5 and
SF2523 as determined by IVIS imaging, with no hepatic toxicity. Our hypothesis is that BRD4/PI3K and Hh
signaling pathways exert control over CSC proliferation in SHH-MB and hence represents a target for therapeutic
exploitation with small molecules which can inhibit these signaling pathways. Our specific aims are to i) evaluate
the resensitization effects of MDB5 and SF2523 on SHH and MYC driven MB and patient derived xenograft
(PDX) cells; ii) formulate MDB5 and SF2523 into NPs with COG-133 conjugation and determine biodistribution
and systemic/organ toxicity; and iii) determine effects of targeted NPs loaded with SF2523 and MDB5 in SHH
and MYC driven orthotopic, patient derived xenograft (PDX) and transgenic SmoA1 MB mouse models. Long-
term significance. Successful completion of this project will provide a platform technology for treating SHH-
MB and other brain tumors using this innovative NP-based combination therapy of Hh and BRD4/PI3K inhibitors."
10738257,"Abstract
Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and acquired infantile
hydrocephalus in preterm infants in the United States, with little progress made in its clinical management. Blood
clots have been shown to elicit secondary brain injury after GMH, by disrupting normal cerebrospinal fluid
circulation and absorption after germinal matrix hemorrhage causing post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus
development. Current experimental evidence suggests that rapid hematoma resolution is necessary to quickly
ameliorate inflammation and improve neurological outcomes after hemorrhagic stroke. N-formyl peptide receptor
2 (FPR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor, has been shown to be neuroprotective after stroke. FPR2 activation has
been associated with the upregulation of phagocytic macrophage clearance, yet its mechanism has not been
fully explored. Recent literature suggests that FPR2 may play a role in the stimulation of scavenger receptor
CD36. Scavenger receptor CD36, a trans-membrane glycoprotein, plays a vital role in microglia phagocytic blood
clot clearance after GMH. FPR2 has been shown to activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2),
which promotes the transcription of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) gene. Current literature
suggests that DUSP1 may act on CD36 receptor and may play a role in FPR2 induced phagocytosis. Our
preliminary suggests that FPR2 activation enhances hematoma resolution and improves neurological deficits.
Therefore, we seek to elucidate the underlying hematoma resolving mechanism of FPR2. We hypothesize that
FPR2 stimulation enhances microglia induced hematoma resolution through the activation of the ERK
(1/2)/DUSP1/CD36 signaling pathway, thereby improving short- and long-term neurological outcomes.
Aim 1 will investigate the role of FPR2 in enhancing hematoma resolution, thereby improving neurological
function following GMH. Aim 2 will investigate FPR2-induced activation of the ERK/DUSP1/CD36 signaling
pathway after GMH. The long-term goal of this proposal is to provide a basis for clinical translation of FPR2
stimulation as an effective non-invasive therapeutic strategy to protect against acute and chronic complications
in the GMH patient population."
10747304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumor that causes neurological deterioration and death in most patients within 2
years. Despite aggressive therapy, most GBMs reappear within 6 months. A major reason for this outcome is
because GBM stem cells (GSCs) are resistant to existing therapies. Currently, no treatment consistently kills
these highly resistant cells. However, the Zika virus epidemic has provided us with a new approach to eradicate
GSCs. ZIKV targets normal stem cells in the developing fetal brain, yet has minimal effects on differentiated
neurons or the adult brain. Since GSCs share properties with neural stem cells, we investigated whether the
natural honing and lytic activity of ZIKV could be harnessed to target and kill GSCs. We published the first use
of ZIKV to kill GSCs. We showed that ZIKV kills GSCs in tumors removed from patients, with minimal impact on
non-GSC tumor cells, called differentiated GBM cells. Importantly, normal human brain cells were not affected
by ZIKV. After intracranial treatment with ZIKV, mice harboring gliomas survived more than twice as long as
untreated mice and, in some cases, treated mice were long-term survivors. In addition to the resistance of GBM
stem cell to chemoradiation, GBM is the hallmark example of an immunotherapy-resistant tumor. Importantly,
we found that in vivo, ZIKV treatment reduces tumor size and extends survival beyond that expected for only
anti-GSC effects. This suggested that ZIKV killing of GSCs may trigger an immune response against the
remainder of the tumor. In more recent studies, we have found that CD8+ T cells are required for the efficacy of
ZIKV as an oncolytic therapy in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that ZIKV elicits an anti-tumor immune response
that could be made even more effective by combining it with existing immunotherapies. Aim 1 will determine how
CD8+ T cells promote tumor clearance after ZIKV and Aim 2 will determine whether ZIKV can be combined with
immunotherapy or standard-of-care for GBM to improve outcomes. Our long-term goal is to develop a new
treatment for GBM by leveraging the immune system response to ZIKV."

10797024,"The Pilot Projects Program will represent an essential component of the long-term sustainability of the Alcohol
Center Of Research-Nebraska (ACORN). This program supports project investigators with funding up to
$25,000 over an 18-month period. The program goal is to enable investigators to collect preliminary data to
support submission of grant applications for independent, longer-term, larger projects related to alcohol
research. The central hypothesis of this program is that pilot and/or feasibility projects funded from this Center
will result in subsequent grant submissions to NIAAA or other funding agencies to advance alcohol research.
The projects selected for support by this program must address a critical issue in alcohol research and clearly
lead to future, more extensive study of the selected critical issue. In addition to the budgeted $50,000/year for
pilot projects contained in this NIAAA application, matching funding from the University of Nebraska Medical
Center’s Vice Chancellor for Research ($50,000/year), will allowed ACORN to double the number of pilot
projects over the same 5-year period. The aims of this program proposal are to: (1) Select and fund at least
four 18-month pilot/feasibility projects each year; (2) Evaluate the results of each pilot/feasibility project; and (3)
Monitor the effectiveness of converting pilot/feasibility projects into funded grants. A commitment of $50,000
per year from the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Vice Chancellor for Research will allow ACORN to
fund at least 2 additional pilot projects per year. The pilot/feasibility projects will be selected for funding based
on review by investigators knowledgeable about specific areas of alcohol research. The selected projects will
be evaluated based on periodic required reports and monitoring of subsequent funded research grants based
on the results of the pilot/feasibility projects. We expect that most of the selected pilot and feasibility studies will
lead to applications for subsequent research projects building on the pilot/feasibility data."

The overarching goal of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Social-Behavioral Theory Core (IDEST) is to
support and train CDUHR investigators to apply theories and knowledge about multilevel factors, including
current large-scale trends and events that are affecting HIV transmission, natural history, prevention, and
clinical care, so that they are prepared to develop and carry out rigorous high-impact research that will
contribute to ending HIV among people who use drugs (PWUD). (We refer to these large-scale disruptive
trends and events as Big Events and Big Trends (BE/BT).) There has been a recent resurgence in new HIV
infections and outbreaks among PWUD in the US and abroad, and, in many settings, the COVID-19 pandemic
has generated the same circumstances that led to those outbreaks. This signals the need for a reinvigorated
HIV research agenda.
The IDEST Core has the following Specific Aims: 1) Encourage and support CDUHR investigators in applying
and integrating knowledge and theory about substance use and HIV epidemiology, prevention, and treatment
to enhance current studies and to develop and conduct new clinical, social-behavioral, and epidemiologic
research that will contribute to ending HIV in PWUD; 2) Provide training on multilevel factors that may promote
or impede ending HIV in the context of societal disruption, leading to studies that take these factors into
account; and 3) Lead the field in guiding a broad research and training agenda by developing and
disseminating relevant existing and new transdisciplinary theories and frameworks, with a focus on multilevel
and time-varying considerations generally and BE/BT in particular.
Core members are experts in the epidemiology, prevention, care and treatment of HIV infection and HIV-
related related co-morbidities, co-infections, and complications; in the study of substance use including
substance use disorders, and harm reduction; and in the development and use of relevant theories and novel,
theory-based metrics. All Core members have been highly productive in the field and within the Center. The
Core will provide training and consultation, and will take the lead within the Center on bringing emerging,
scientifically relevant issues, new theories, and advances in epidemiologic, biomedical and clinical aspects of
HIV and substance use to CDUHR investigators, with a focus on new and early stage investigators (new/ESI)
and underrepresented investigators. The IDEST Core will collaborate with other Cores and Center Leadership
to support CDUHR investigators to develop innovative high impact studies which will lead to new knowledge
related to the multilevel factors driving HIV among PWUD to guide interventions and policies promoting

The overarching goals of the Transdisciplinary Research Methods (TRM) Core are to (1) train and support our
affiliated investigators in application of relevant research methods, including methods that may be new or
complex, (2) make our investigators aware of innovative, cutting-edge methods that may be useful in their work
and can open up possibilities that inspire new research questions, and (3) contribute to methodological
advances. One primary area of emphasis will be on methods needed to understand the impacts of multilevel,
time-varying processes and Big Events/BigTrends (BE/BT) on HIV prevention and care among PWUD. To
support the work of a multidisciplinary set of investigators, we represent a range of expertise that includes field
research and sampling; ethnography; infectious disease etiology, epidemiology and surveillance; community-
engaged research; intervention design and testing, including optimization; and (now) designs and methods for
causal inference, and the frameworks and methods of implementation science. This expertise is needed to
understand how BE/BT impact the lives and health of PWUD, and to carry out research to develop
interventions that will be relevant, resilient, and adaptable to societal changes. Building on prior successes, this
Core will continue to focus on assisting affiliated investigators to integrate study design and methods with
theories of prevention and care; create testable models of causal pathways; detect and respond to HIV
outbreaks and other sequelae of BE/BT; and develop, test and implement potent and sustainable social,
behavioral, and social-structural interventions. Specific Aims of the TRM core are: Aim 1. Lead the field and
support CDUHR affiliated investigators in applying methods to enhance research conducted in the context of
disruptions due to BE/BT by providing training, seminars, and consultation on quantitative, qualitative, and
mixed methods, including the creative application and novel extensions of existing methods. Aim 2. Lead the
field in the integration of the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), implementation science (IS), and
community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and build the capacity of CDUHR investigators to
develop highly effective, efficient, implementable, and sustainable behavioral, biobehavioral, and social-
structural interventions for prevention and treatment of HIV among PWUD by providing training and support in

of the PPM Core will be achieved through an individualized approach that centers upon each participant's
strengths, training, and identified needs, in addition to considering those of their mentoring team. To this end,
the PPM Core builds upon its well-established pillars of evidence-based training and mentoring which include
(1) didactic trainings, (2) pilot projects, (3) interdisciplinary team mentoring, (4) individual development plans,
and (5) structured support and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) training for mentors. In
CDUHR-6, the Core incorporates three additional innovative pillars that have recently emerged as critical to a
comprehensive, evidence-informed, and effective mentoring program: (1) meaningful community engagement
principles, (2) training that focuses on maximizing research impact and (3) integrated positionality-informed
approaches to mentoring. Each of these eight pillars addresses specific gaps to equip the next generation of
investigators to make important contributions toward preventing HIV infection, morbidity, and mortality among
PWUD, in alignment with NIH priorities and the overall scientific and infrastructure aims of the Center. We are
committed to supporting our investigators to address complex problems, as represented in the CDUHR-6
theme of “Reinvigorating HIV Prevention and Care for PWUD: Accelerating progress and sustaining gains in
the midst of societal disruption.” The PPM Core will leverage the outstanding experience, knowledge, and
resources represented within the Center to enable our scientists to strengthen their research skills and develop
strong and fruitful collaborations with community members and colleagues to pursue a personally rewarding

10746746,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entity in the biosphere and are responsible for much of bacterial
evolution. Most phages utilize elaborate tail machines to translocate their viral DNA and proteins into a host cell.
During the last grant period, we made considerable progress in documenting infection initiation from several
classic phages (T7, T4, P22, SP6, Φ29, and λ). Our studies provided new molecular insights into the mechanisms
by which these tailed phages overcome the multiple barriers of the bacterial cell envelope and to deliver their
genetic material into the host cell cytoplasm. Here we focus entirely on T7, because a complete mechanistic
description of how T7 infection is initiated and how DNA translocation is effected remains elusive. The signal
triggering protein ejection is not known. How do the core proteins penetrate the outer membrane, and how is the
cytoplasmic membrane breached? How does the extended tail nanomachine function to deliver its cargo – the
phage genome – into a cell? Equally importantly, how are the conformational changes in the tail and fibers
coordinated so that the initial interaction of a phage with a susceptible cell almost inexorably leads to infection?
A completely unanticipated observation for any phage system is that T7 recruits the host F1FO ATP synthase at
the initiation of infection. Our central hypothesis is that T7 undergoes massive conformational changes to
facilitate adsorption, channel formation, and DNA translocation. Our collaborative experimental approach where
structural biology in situ is intimately coupled to genetics and physiology will address these fundamental
questions. Three specific aims are: (1) Dissect the structure and function of the T7 genome ejection machine;
(2) determine how the extended T7 tail spans the cell envelope; (3) illuminate mechanisms of adsorption and
recruitment of the F1FO ATP synthase."
10748292,"Project Summary
Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) remains a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality in lung transplant (Tx)
recipients. The Lung Transplant Outcomes Group (LTOG) has been studying this problem for the past decade and a newly
NIH-funded LTOG-related project (1U01HL14535-01), headed by Dr. Jason Christie (UPENN), involves long-term follow-
up of adult lung transplant recipients. In preliminary studies, undertaken in collaboration with LTOG, we found that patients
who subsequently developed PGD had significantly elevated pre-Tx levels of HDAC6 mRNA in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. We identified CD14+ monocytes as the main source of upregulated HDAC6 in pre-Tx PGD-prone
patients, observed an inflammatory phenotype of those monocytes after stimulation in vitro, and found that HDAC6
targeting significantly decreased cytokine production in an in vivo murine lung model of ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that recipient blood monocytes with upregulated HDAC6 expression pre-lung Tx are
important drivers of graft injury and development of PGD, and that such elevated HDAC6 expression in monocytes may be
of prognostic and therapeutic significance. We propose to test this hypothesis by studying pre-Tx blood samples from
patients enrolled in the parent U01 that began June 15, 2019. Aim 1: Determine if the phenotype of upregulated HDAC6
in monocytes of patients listed for lung Tx is a risk factor for developing PGD? We will expand upon our preliminary
data using a larger sample size to evaluate 1.1) pre-Tx levels of monocyte HDAC6 expression, including mRNA and protein
levels, and co-expression of classical markers of monocyte activation; and 1.2) post-Tx events (PGD with grade) in relation
to the pre-Tx monocyte phenotype. Aim 2: What are the mechanisms by which HDAC6 alters key monocyte
characteristics? We will: 2.1) evaluate cytokine expression (qPCR, flow cytometry, ELISA) by monocytes isolated from
pre-Tx recipients and healthy donors, in relation to their HDAC6 levels; and 2.2) study how high HDAC6 expression
regulates TLR/MyD88 pathway activation. Aim 3: Test whether HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) therapy can reverse or
diminish the effects of monocyte dysfunction, including ex vivo and in a murine model of PGD. We will: 3.1) test
effects of HDAC6i on monocyte activation, cytokine production and interaction with other immune cells; 3.2) test effects
of one or more novel HDAC6i small molecules (monocyte specific HDAC6i, HDAC6 zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain
inhibitor and HDAC6i PROTAC); and 3.3) apply HDAC6i in vivo in a recently described new murine model of PGD.
Importantly, our studies will • delineate pathogenic mechanisms of disease; • identify mechanisms or factors that influence
and/or predict response to treatment; and • discover or validate biomarkers of disease development and/or progression."
10746752,"Acute care hospitals discharge over 1.5 million sepsis survivors annually. Sepsis survivors are twice as likely
as non-sepsis patients to be readmitted within 30 days, with 32% of those readmissions occurring within 7
days. Annually, over one third of sepsis survivors transition to skilled home health care (HHC) after their
hospitalization where nurses monitor for reinfection, support uninterrupted medication management, and work
with patients, caregivers, other providers to support continued recovery. This proposed competing renewal is
based on HHC best practice evidence generated by our previous study (RO1-NR016014) showing the value of
early visits by registered nurses and early outpatient provider follow-up. We found that 30-day rehospitalization
rates were 7 percentage points lower (a 41% relative reduction) when sepsis survivors received a HHC nursing
visit within 2 days of hospital discharge, at least 1 more visit the first week, and an outpatient provider follow-up
visit by 7 days compared to those without timely follow-up. However, nationwide, only 28% of sepsis survivors
who transitioned to HHC received this early visit protocol because several barriers to achieving this protocol
exist. To advance the science, the proposed study will test the effectiveness of this practice in the real
world and study the implementation with a pragmatic, Type 1 hybrid, stepped wedge randomized trial
in partnership with dyads of acute and HHC stakeholders. Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of the I-
TRANSFER intervention compared to usual care on 30-day rehospitalization and emergency department use
among sepsis survivors receiving home health care. The stepped wedge protocol will involve a baseline period
with no intervention, and two steps where randomized dyads provide the intervention. In addition to the usual
care/control periods from the dyad sites, additional survivors from national data will provide a much larger
sample of control observations, weighted to produce covariate balance. The hypotheses will be tested using
generalized mixed models with covariates guided by the Anderson Behavioral Model of Health Services. In aim
2 we will: Produce insights and generalizable knowledge regarding the context, processes, strategies, and
determinants of I-TRANSFER implementation. The implementation aim is guided by the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research. As the largest HHC study of its kind and the first to transform this
type of care through implementation science, the proposed study has the potential to produce new knowledge
about the process of transition to and care in home health. If effective, the impact of this intervention during this
common transition process could be widespread, improving the outcomes for a growing, vulnerable population
of sepsis survivors. An Advisory Group of national experts will assist with widespread dissemination of the
study results."
10753449,"SUMMARY
Devastating and persistent neurological deficits occur after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), despite survival of nearly
all neurons. The primary cause of disability is disconnection of networks by axon transection. Recovery of
some movement would be adequate for patients to gain a level of independence in wheel chair transfers,
bowel and bladder management, and locomotion. Today, there is no approved medical therapy for the 300,000
to 1,200,000 individuals in the USA with SCI.
The CNS of adult mammals, as compared to the peripheral nervous system of mammals or the nervous
system of other organisms, has extremely limited capacity for axonal regeneration. Our axonal growth studies
included discovery of Nogo and Nogo Receptor (NgR1). We demonstrated their role in preventing axonal
sprouting, regeneration and recovery after injury. We have demonstrated that NgR1(310)-Fc is efficacious for
recovery from SCI, even when treatment starts months after damage. It is being developed for human SCI
trials now.
While specific factors, such as NgR1, limiting axon regeneration have been identified, they provide an
incomplete explanation for poor adult mammalian CNS regeneration. We completed a genome-wide shRNA
screen for endogenous genes limiting mammalian CNS axon repair. The validity of this method was
demonstrated by the identification of INPP5F as a gene limiting neural repair in a pilot screen of phosphatases.
One cellular pathway is bioinformatically the most enriched gene set in the mammalian screen, and also
regulates regeneration in nematodes. The relevance of this pathway will be tested in preclinical models of
traumatic SCI. Both gene deletion strains and pharmacological inhibition will be studied to provide a validated
pathway for future therapeutic development. The findings will have high relevance for the development of novel
therapeutics for SCI."
10753512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica or DM) is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults
(prevalence is 1/8,000) and an autosomal dominant multisystem disease caused by a CTG trinucleotide
expansion in DMPK gene (DM type 1) or CCTG tetranucleotide expansion in CNBP gene (DM type 2). Such
DNA expansions are responsible for the presence of toxic RNA molecules. Promising therapies are in current
development to target these RNA transcripts; however, disease biomarkers to monitor disease activity and
patient’s response to upcoming treatments are lacking. The proposed research focuses on identifying reliable
and non-invasive biomarkers that serve to monitor the slow progression of DM muscle disease and that can be
later used to also monitor response to upcoming treatments. This project not only addresses the need for
muscle biomarkers in DM type 1 but also in DM type 2, that although less frequent, it is probably
underdiagnosed. The applicant’s research strategy aims at investigating skeletal muscle MRI and ultrasound,
and electrical impedance myography as monitoring disease biomarkers. The candidate’s research
environment is ideal for the proposed project. The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard
Medical School provide an enriching and motivating academic atmosphere for trainees who have the
opportunity to attend high-quality courses/lectures, collaborate with expert scientists and clinicians in the field
of neuromuscular disorders and skeletal muscle imaging. The candidate’s mentoring team is composed by
Dr. Thurman Wheeler and Dr. Seward Rutkove. Dr. Wheeler has been investigating DM for almost two
decades by using in vitro and animal models of the disease, and more recently also disease biomarkers in
patients’ biofluids. He has significantly contributed to advance the understanding of DM and he has become a
renowned researcher in the field as shown in his numerous high-impact factor publications. Dr. Rutkove is a
neuromuscular specialist with expertise on skeletal muscle ultrasound and electrical impedance myography,
and with a successful clinical research career in the design and development of new technologies to better
characterize neuromuscular diseases. As collaborator and consultant, Dr. Martin Torriani who directs the MGH
Musculoskeletal Imaging Core and is an expert on skeletal muscle MRI. The advisory team will also
contribute with expertise in applied computational methods and biostatistics (Dr. Hang Lee), and high-quality
translational research in neuromuscular diseases and readiness for biomarker application into future clinical
trials (Dr. Basil Darras and Dr. Sabrina Paganoni). The candidate’s training plan includes career development
lectures (i.e Training in Responsible Conduct of Research), Harvard Catalyst courses (i.e Certificate in Applied
Biostatistics) and attendance to scientific meetings (i.e Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation and Muscle Study
Group). Candidate’s career goal is to transition towards an independent clinician-scientist position in the field
of neuromuscular diseases with main focus on muscular dystrophies and patient-oriented research."
10749871,"In natural vision, objects change appearance over time as they translate, rotate, become occluded or undergo
complex transformations, e.g., during biological motion. In these dynamic environments, the visual cortex
integrates information over multiple spatial and temporal scales to compute motion trajectories and represent
the shape of objects. To understand how form and motion percepts are derived from such dynamic visual
input, we will investigate how neuronal responses in area V4—an intermediate stage along the ventral visual
pathway—are shaped by the spatiotemporal integration of time-varying visual stimuli. We will test the
hypothesis that the spatiotemporal characteristics of V4 neurons are suited for tracking dynamic objects:
specifically, V4 motion signals arise from object-tracking over longer spatiotemporal windows than comparable
dorsal-stream areas and that V4 signals reflect form transformations at an object level rather than at the level
of the local retinal image. We will leverage the percept of long-range apparent motion to probe the role of V4
neurons in motion perception (Aim 1). When a stimulus intermittently skips across the visual field with large
spatial and temporal steps, it induces a strong illusory motion percept but neurons in V1 and MT of the dorsal
visual stream are strikingly insensitive to the direction of the perceived motion. Psychophysical studies have
argued that long-range apparent motion relies not on the dorsal stream but on higher order object tracking
processes with large spatiotemporal windows in the ventral visual stream. We will conduct the first
neurophysiological investigations in the awake monkey to ascertain the role of V4 in the perception of long-
range apparent motion. Next (Aim 2), we will use dynamic stimuli that rotate in the fronto-parallel plane, and
translate and rotate in depth, to determine whether V4 neurons encode other common dynamic object
transformations (beyond long-range translation), and whether the encoding is based on a sequence of static
poses, as in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex, or dynamic transformations. Finally, we will examine the encoding
and perception of partially occluded dynamic objects (Aim 3). When an occluded object moves, different parts
of the object are revealed over time and integration across time and multiple neuronal receptive fields is
required to build an entire object representation. As animals discriminate moving occluded objects, we will
study 50-100 neurons with high-density Neuropixels probes. We will use single trial population decoding
methods to determine how dynamic stimulus information is integrated across the V4 network to extract object
shape and the motion trajectory and how V4 contributes to psychophysical behavior. We anticipate that our
results will reveal an important role for V4 in the processing of dynamic stimuli that is complementary to those
of MT and IT cortex and will establish the level of internal visual representation operating in V4. Our studies will
provide a deeper understanding of the neuronal basis of global motion perception and the tracking of dynamic
objects—processes that are impaired in aging populations, especially those with Alzheimer’s disease."

 Our ROBIN center focuses on elucidating the genomic and microenvironmental determinants, and
temporal dynamics underlying efficacy of radiation-based combination therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), alone or
in combination with other treatments, is used to treat about two-thirds of all cancer patients. Despite the
widespread use of radiation therapy in oncology, our understanding of the mechanisms driving response and
resistance remains poor. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that underlie efficacy and
resistance of radiation-based therapies. New efforts to improve treatment for many cancer types now focus on
using combination therapies in which radiation is used with systemic agents, highlighting the urgent need to
understand the drivers of efficacy. Among the most promising new biologics being studied for use with
radiation are antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We will use an
innovative molecular characterization trial testing radiation plus ADC in bladder cancer and radiation plus ICI in
head and neck cancer to characterize the mechanistic drivers underlying these next generation RT-based
combinations. The central hypothesis of this U54 application is that specific genetic and immunologic
mechanisms underlie sensitivity and resistance to radiation-based combination therapies. We will address
these questions through 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will work to understand the molecular mechanisms that
underlie efficacy of treatment with radiation plus ADC. Here, our working hypothesis is that specific genetic and
immunologic events underlie response to RT plus sacituzumab govitecan (SG) treatment. We will leverage our
molecular characterization trial (Part A) investigating the use of RT and sacituzumab for bladder preservation
therapy. We will determine the differential molecular effects with standard-of-care RT + cisplatin versus RT +
SG. In Aim 2, we will improve identification of patients who are sensitive or resistant to RT-based therapies
based on new insights into transcriptional dynamics and temporal reprogramming during treatment with
radiation-based therapies. Here, we will leverage our molecular characterization trial treating head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or bladder cancer patients with RT + chemotherapy versus RT + SG or
ICI. We will build on recent experimental and clinical breakthroughs led by our research groups, which have
identified highly refined gene expression programs associated with RT sensitivity and delta radiomics. In Aim
3, we will identify the differential mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activities of RT + cisplatin versus RT +
immune checkpoint blockade. Here, using our head and neck trial (Part B), we will uncover the unique genetic
and immunologic factors that govern response to RT when combined with these two classes of agents. We
will elucidate the differential molecular effects of the two approaches, immune reprogramming, and
mechanisms of acquired resistance. Our studies will help build a foundation to optimize multimodal, radiation-
based definitive treatment strategies."

understand the drivers of efficacy. Among the most promising new biologics being studied for use with
radiation are antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We will use an

head and neck cancer to characterize the mechanistic drivers underlying these next generation RT-based

underlie efficacy of treatment with radiation plus ADC. Here, our working hypothesis is that specific genetic and
immunologic events underlie response to RT plus sacituzumab govitecan (SG) treatment. We will leverage our
molecular characterization trial (Part A) investigating the use of RT and sacituzumab for bladder preservation
therapy. We will determine the differential molecular effects with standard-of-care RT + cisplatin versus RT +
SG. In Aim 2, we will improve identification of patients who are sensitive or resistant to RT-based therapies
based on new insights into transcriptional dynamics and temporal reprogramming during treatment with
radiation-based therapies. Here, we will leverage our molecular characterization trial treating head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or bladder cancer patients with RT + chemotherapy versus RT + SG or
ICI. We will build on recent experimental and clinical breakthroughs led by our research groups, which have
identified highly refined gene expression programs associated with RT sensitivity and delta radiomics. In Aim
3, we will identify the differential mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activities of RT + cisplatin versus RT +
immune checkpoint blockade. Here, using our head and neck trial (Part B), we will uncover the unique genetic
and immunologic factors that govern response to RT when combined with these two classes of agents. We
will elucidate the differential molecular effects of the two approaches, immune reprogramming, and
mechanisms of acquired resistance. Our studies will help build a foundation to optimize multimodal, radiation-

 Our ROBIN center focuses on elucidating the genomic and microenvironmental determinants, and
temporal dynamics underlying efficacy of radiation-based combination therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), alone or
in combination with other treatments, is used to treat about two-thirds of all cancer patients. Despite the
widespread use of radiation therapy in oncology, our understanding of the mechanisms driving response and
resistance remains poor. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that underlie efficacy and

Epilepsy is the world’s most common, serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For
one-third of patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite maximal medical management. In these patients,
seizures often arise from a localized brain region, and neurosurgical interventions are the most effective
treatment option. When successful, surgical interventions provide cure from seizures, and also prevent or
reverse the disabling consequences of uncontrolled seizures. Critical to successful intervention is accurate
identification of the core tissue responsible for generating seizures (i.e., the epileptogenic zone). Traditionally,
this tissue would be surgically resected, but modern approaches aim to focally disrupt this tissue with targeted
electrical stimulation (i.e. neuromodulation). Improvements in epilepsy care are now limited by (i) the inability to
accurately identify the epileptogenic zone; (ii) a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying epileptiform
activity; (iii) a lack of understanding of how to target these mechanisms with neurostimulation. The most common
approach to identify the epileptogenic zone is through continuous recording of a patient’s cortical electrical
activity to capture seizures. However, because seizures are infrequent, this approach is expensive, time
consuming, and unpleasant for patients. Moreover, this approach often fails to identify the epileptogenic zone,
resulting in unsuccessful neurosurgical intervention in 20-70% of cases. To address this, interictal biomarkers of
the epileptogenic zone that manifest between seizures are required. Two such biomarkers have been proposed:
(a) interictal discharges or spikes, and (b) high frequency oscillations or ripples. While both signals have been
extensively studied, neither accurately delimits the epileptogenic zone. Spikes are specific for epilepsy, but too
spatially diffuse to identify the epileptogenic zone. Ripples are spatially focal, but represent both pathologic and
physiologic processes. We address these limitations by focusing on the simultaneous occurrence of a spike and
ripple, “spike-ripple” discharges, as an improved biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Spike-ripples commonly
occur in patients with epilepsy, improve the spatial specificity of spikes for the epileptogenic zone, and
disentangle physiologic from pathologic ripples. Our interdisciplinary team will apply expertise in epilepsy,
neurophysiology, neurosurgery, animal experiments, modeling, and statistics to: (i) develop a fully automated
spike-ripple detector and compare its clinical utility to predict surgical outcome to spikes and ripples alone, (ii)
identify the biological mechanisms that generate spike-ripple discharges using novel voltage imaging techniques
in animal models combined with computational models; and (iii) develop principled neurostimulation protocols to
disrupt the mechanisms that generate spike-ripples. Completion of these Aims will represent significant progress
towards resolving fundamental questions in modern epilepsy research, an understanding of mechanisms in the
core epileptogenic network that generate spike-ripples, and a principled approach to neurostimulation to focally
disrupt these pathologic dynamics."
10740879,"This project continues the development and support of ERPLAB Toolbox, a Matlab-based open
source software package for the analysis of event-related potential (ERP) data. ERPs provide
information about brain activity related to perception, cognition, emotion, and action with millisecond
resolution and are widely used to study a broad range of basic and translational science issues in
psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and related fields. ERPs are widely used in research
on the mind and brain, but progress has been hampered by the limited abilities of commercial ERP
analysis packages, which often include out-of-date processing and analysis procedures, obscure the
details of the algorithms, make it difficult to automate data processing, and discourage the development
and sharing of new processing and analysis methods. Moreover, these packages are extremely
expensive, taking funds away from other purposes and limiting the number of analysis workstations that
a given lab can afford.
 ERPLAB Toolbox directly addresses these shortcomings of commercial ERP analysis packages. It
provides powerful but easy-to-use tools for the basic and advanced analysis procedures that are
commonly used by ERP researchers. The individual procedures are designed to provide substantial
flexibility while also encouraging best practices that maximize reproducibility and replicability. All
ERPLAB tools can be accessed from a GUI to maximize ease of use, and they can also be accessed
from Matlab scripts to provide automation and customization. In addition, ERPLAB can be easily
extended by anyone with rudimentary programming skills, making it possible for researchers to create
innovative new data processing and analysis procedures and link ERPs with other types of biological
data.
 ERPLAB has been downloaded over 45,000 times and has been cited in over 1650 publications. It
has been used to replace expensive commercial software for conventional analyses, and it has been
used as a platform for developing new analysis procedures and for linking ERP data with other open
source toolboxes. In the proposed funding period, we will continue to provide basic support and
develop new features that reflect trends in basic, translational, and clinical research. We will focus on
four themes: increased workflow efficiency; addition of multivariate pattern analysis methods; tools for
increasing the reproducibility of methods and the replicability of results; and extensive new training
materials. Our goal is to give researchers free, open-source tools that allow them to conduct innovative,
state-of-the-art, high-impact research on normal and disordered brain function."
10994045,"Focal cerebral arteriopathy of childhood (FCA)—one of the most common causes of arterial ischemic stroke in a healthy child—is an acute, monophasic, and presumed inflammatory arteriopathy of the distal internal carotid artery and its proximal branches. It has an aggressive natural history, typically progressing from mild arterial irregularity at presentation to high-grade stenosis within days. Greater severity of the arteriopathy correlates with larger infarct size and poorer neurological outcomes. The time interval from presentation to maximal severity represents a window of opportunity to intervene and improve outcomes. Current management includes aspirin, supportive care, and high-dose corticosteroids despite the absence of efficacy data. A Delphi consensus identified a clinical trial of corticosteroids for FCA as the highest research priority amongst international pediatric stroke neurologists. Surveys of U.S. pediatric stroke investigators also indicate an unwillingness to randomize children with FCA to “no steroids,” making a traditional randomized placebo- controlled trial infeasible. The most pressing clinical question is whether to treat all children with suspected FCA immediately or wait and treat only the subset that demonstrate the disease progression characteristic of FCA. Immediate treatment has the potential advantage of preventing FCA progression, but the disadvantage of diagnostic uncertainty at initial presentation, leading to unnecessary steroid exposure in children with other stroke etiologies. Clinicians also lack safety data needed for corticosteroid risk/benefit discussions with families of children with FCA. The primary aim of the Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy Steroid (FOCAS) trial is to compare the effectiveness of two strategies for treating suspected FCA with corticosteroids: (Strategy A) immediate treatment of all patients, versus (Strategy B) selective treatment of only those that demonstrate disease progression confirming the FCA diagnosis. The secondary aim is to determine the safety and tolerability of corticosteroid therapy in the setting of FCA and acute ischemic brain injury. Using a comparative-effectiveness trial design, FOCAS will prospectively enroll 80 children with suspected FCA presenting with arterial ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack at 25 centers over 5.5 years and randomize them 1:1 to Strategy A or B. The primary endpoint will be an imaging outcome: change in FCA severity score from baseline to 1 month, measured by blinded central neuroradiologists comparing MRAs performed on the same scanner. Infarct volume at 1-month and neurological outcome at 6-months will be secondary endpoints. FOCAS safety outcomes will address clinical concerns for severe infection and hemorrhagic transformation of infarctions due to steroid-induced hypertension. The overall goal is to obtain clinically pertinent evidence that will immediately guide FCA management and help effect better outcomes for children with this dangerous arteriopathy."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid
(ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have
been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM. While
ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side
effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS
in women with T2DM. Before we are able to evaluate the neonatal benefit of ACS in this population, the first
step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia
after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use
of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to
overcome these challenges. My long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with
T2DM as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test
the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the
association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. My central hypothesis is that
treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving
neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment
strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at
achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic
control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims in this K23 proposal will determine the
optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve
neonatal outcomes among women with T2DM and threatened PTB. The research plan will be augmented by
intensive mentoring from a multidisciplinary team of experts, formal training at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, and participation in premier national training programs. The training plan was carefully crafted to
ensure Dr. Battarbee achieves her specified career development goals: 1) Expand skills in CGM data
acquisition, management and analysis of repeated measures, 2) Understand behavioral science theory and
develop skills in implementation science, 3) Develop skills for leading a multidisciplinary research team, and 4)
Refine grant writing skills to ensure ability to secure funding for future research. Completion of this proposal will
transform care of pregnant women with T2DM receiving ACS and uniquely position Dr. Battarbee to achieve
independence with R01 funding to improve neonatal outcomes of women with T2DM on a larger scale."

to the research agendas of several DAIDS HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks and thereby achieve the desired
efficiency for a CTU. The Aims of this application are: 1) to continue to advance the scientific agenda of the
DAIDS HIV/AIDS Therapeutic and Prevention networks by developing and implementing high-priority research
studies as key protocol team members, by serving on major network leadership and scientific committees, and
by directing the ACTG Laboratory Center (LC) Virology and Immunology Specialty Laboratories; 2) to recruit,
enroll, retain and monitor study participants in high-priority protocols of the DAIDS networks, and to meet and
exceed performance standards established by these networks; 3) to engage with partners in our communities,
including Columbus, Ohio, located in Franklin County (one of the 48 counties in the US with the highest HIV
burden) to support implementation science initiatives consistent with the national “Ending the HIV Epidemic
Plan”; 4) to partner with affected communities and community advisory boards at each CRS throughout these
endeavors; and 5) to mentor young investigators identified at each CRS to become skilled, independent
researchers. The key scientific areas of focus in HIV therapeutics will include HIV reservoirs and control of HIV
replication in the absence of ART (“ART-free remission”); novel and long-acting interventions for the treatment
of HIV; and prevention and treatment of HIV-related non-infectious co-morbidities and Hepatitis B. In HIV
Prevention, the Pitt-OSU CTU will utilize skills and expertise developed over the past decade to focus on long-
acting antiretroviral agents and delivery systems for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP); evaluation of
multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) and broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV prevention; and
integrated strategies for HIV prevention. The collective expertise, administrative efficiency, and performance
record of the Pitt-OSU CTU and its CRSs over the last grant cycle ensure that these Specific Aims are achievable
and that the Pitt-OSU CTU will make important contributions to the research agendas of DAIDS-sponsored
networks, with the ultimate goal of ending the AIDS epidemic."

intensive program of mentored clinical research training and career development activities to promote the
research independence of Scholars in the area of substance use disorders. The substantial expertise in
addictions research at MUSC ensures our ability to mentor individuals in early stages of their research careers
to contribute significantly to the understanding and treatment of substance use disorders. In the previous funding
periods, an infrastructure of a strong mentorship development program has been established and participating
Scholars have had significant success in obtaining independent federal funding. This application requests
support to build on our previous programmatic successes by making innovative changes to strengthen the K12
program, including increasing opportunities for Scholar training in leadership development and science writing,
providing innovative and timely didactic trainings in clinical research and entrepreneurship, broadening our
mentorship pool to provide expertise in telehealth, opioid use disorders, and health disparities, and leveraging
the newly developed MUSC Regional Health Network to expand addiction research throughout South Carolina.
There are three Scholar positions in the program. Scholars will remain in the program for typically two to four
years, depending on their level of training and experience at entry and time needed to obtain independent
funding. Scholars will be junior faculty members who are recruited from internal and external pools. In keeping
with the mission of NIDA, emphasis during the renewal funding period will continue to be placed on attracting

10751050,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Every year, nearly 2.5 million U.S. high school athletes participate in contact sports. Each of these athletes
sustains an average of 650 subconcussive head impacts (SHI) in a single season, with some athletes exceeding
1,000 hits from, for example, football tackles and soccer headings. A subconcussive head impact is defined as
an impact that does not trigger the clinically detectable signs and symptoms of concussion. However, these
mechanical forces, if applied repeatedly, can trigger subclinical cellular and molecular disruptions in brain cells.
Adolescence is an especially vulnerable time for neurodevelopment, because of (a) arborization of white matter
tracts within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and between the PFC and limbic structures and (b) synaptic pruning.
Our clinical studies suggest that both acute and chronic exposure to SHI can impair neuro-ophthalmologic
functions, increase the levels of brain-derived proteomic (NF-L, Tau, UCH-L1, GFAP, S100B) and exosome (7
neuron/glia-specific exosomes) biomarkers in blood, and trigger changes in the microstructural integrity of white
matter. Despite these serious public health implications, no empirical basis exists for establishing a safety
protocol or predicting who may develop cumulative pathologic sequelae from SHI, and to what extent, during a
4-year high school football career. The overall goal of this study is to determine the longitudinal effects of SHI
on neural integrity and function in adolescents throughout their high school football careers and to identify the
dose and intensity of SHI that induce chronic, progressive neurodegeneration. Our central hypothesis is that
SHIs in adolescents will gradually degrade neuronal cellular and functional integrity across multiple football
seasons in a head-impact-dependent manner. There are three related, hypothesis-driven aims. We hypothesize
(1) that a panel of brain-derived proteomic (NF-L, Tau, UCH-L1, GFAP) and exosome markers will increase in
blood in response to SHI; (2) that chronic exposure to SHI will disrupt neuro-ophthalmologic function, as reflected
in increased variability in smooth eye pursuit and slower King-Devick performance; and (3) that repetitive SHI
will lead to disruption in white matter microstructure and changes in resting-state fMRI connectivity. We further
hypothesize that with repetitive SHI these changes may not return to baseline and may carry over and
accumulate from one season to the next. By tracking SHI exposure and neurologic health in the same athletes
for 4 years, the proposed study will help to establish safety guidelines for adolescent athletes. The long-term
goal is to prevent neurocognitive deficits in competitive sports athletes."

 All organisms require maintenance of DNA integrity to grow and proliferate. Replication and repair of DNA
damage requires the increased synthesis of DNA nucleotides, a process that is dependent on the activity of the
kinases such as ATM and ATR. Misregulation of DNA replication can result in either cell death or cancer. Studies
by our lab and others have shown that many DNA damage response (DDR) proteins (such as ATM, ATR, XRCC1
and RNR) are stabilized by the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90. These proteins perform a variety of
functions in the cell including protein folding of both newly synthesized and denatured proteins, protein transport
across membranes and disaggregation of oligomerized proteins. Research has primarily focused on how
chaperone function specificity arises through regulation of expression, isoform differences and the variety of co-
chaperone proteins that bind to the Hsp70 and Hsp90 molecules. Despite the identification of several
phosphorylation sites on both yeast and mammalian Hsp70 through global proteomic screens (known as the
chaperone code), the biological function of these remains unclear. Our studies published in Cell determined that
CDK-mediated phosphorylation of a single site on Hsp70 can regulate chaperone function by altering both co-
chaperone and client protein interactions.
 In this proposal, we aim to understand how the activation of DDR can promote changes in the pattern of
Hsp70 chaperone code. We predict that in line with several Hsp90-kinase interactions, Hsp70 phosphorylation
during DNA damage creates a feedback system whereby chaperone phosphorylation increases stability of DDR
proteins, amplifying the signal of the DNA damage response.
 We propose to use both molecular biology and state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques on both
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cell culture cells to achieve the aims of the objectives in our proposal.
Identification and study of functional phosphorylation sites on Hsp70 in both yeast and mammalian cells will
provide us with a completely novel way to target chaperone activity. Hsp70 activity may be suppressed using
specific phosphatase/kinase inhibitors. It may be possible to target specific ‘client’ proteins though alteration of
Hsp70 phosphorylation status and specific Hsp70 phospho-species may have a higher susceptibility to inhibitors.
The scope of this work has broad implications for a variety of diseases associated with both the DNA damage
response and molecular chaperone function, including many types of cancer and neurodegenerative illnesses
caused by protein aggregation (Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease)."

Glioblastoma (GBM), a lethal human brain tumor, is made up of multiple molecular subtypes, suggesting that
therapy could be targeted to particular subtypes. Yet all newly diagnosed GBM patients are treated with a
similar therapeutic regimen, which results in overall poor patient outcomes. GBM tumors contain stem-like cells
(GSCs) that contribute to tumor initiation, growth, and resistance to standard-of-care temozolomide (TMZ) and
ionizing radiation (IR). Thus, GSCs present an excellent system in which to study the biology of GBM and
develop and evaluate targeted therapeutic approaches to GBM. Our long-term goal is to develop mechanism-
based therapeutic approaches to significantly advance the care of GBM patients. Our laboratory discovered
the transcriptional repressor REST as a stem cell promoter, and thus a critical oncogenic regulator, in
medulloblastoma. We and others discovered that REST also regulates oncogenesis in GBM and that tumors
with GSCs expressing high levels of REST (HR-GSCs) are molecularly and biologically distinct from tumors
with GSCs expressing low levels of REST (LR-GSCs). Further, GBM patients with an HR tumor transcriptome
signature have shorter survival than patients with an LR tumor signature, similar to our results with HR-GSC
versus LR-GSC tumors in mouse models. These studies have suggested that REST is a potential therapeutic
target in HR-GBM tumors. Yet there is no REST-specific therapeutic approach for stratified HR-GSC tumors.
The goal of this project is to determine therapeutic approaches for HR-GSC tumors using mouse intracranial
tumor models. First, information obtained here will determine whether targeting HR-GBM tumors with REST-
specific inhibitor, REST-VP16, is a valuable therapeutic approach for HR-GBM. Second, Information obtained
here will determine whether targeting HR-GBM tumors with REST downstream miR targets via exosome-
mediated delivery would promote therapeutic approaches for HR-GBM. Third, we will determine the underlying
regulatory network changes and transcriptome signatures in selected tumors with and without treatment
conditions. Such regulatory networks will provide information about changes in treatment-dependent
downstream pathways and targets. The transcriptome signatures could be useful to measure treatment
progression in a clinical setting. Fourth, we will determine the homing mechanism of Exosome-mediated
delivery of miRs to HR-tumors. Information obtained here will aid in designing exosomes with enhanced
homing capabilities to HR-GBM. Thus, the project has the potential to produce a novel, mechanism-based
therapeutic approach for the HR-GBM subtype, for which such approaches are limited."

implementation in our patients. In its initial four years of funding, the CHOP PCEN has partnered
with PEDSnet through the Learning Health System (LHS) Core to establish a national
interconnected, multi-institutional infrastructure focused on childhood kidney disease. The LHS
Core has extended the data science work of PEDSnet to establish an embedded Pediatric
Nephrology Data Resource that emphasizes data elements and data quality optimization central
to studies of kidney disease. In the next funding cycle, the LHS Core will provide expanded
services for comparative effectiveness and pragmatic trials in pediatric nephrology. Through the
addition of the Molecular Precision Nephrology (MPN) Core, we will facilitate identification of novel
targets to expand therapeutic options for children and youngadults with kidney disease. The MPN
Core is uniquely poised to address critical barriers to the clinical and research implementation of
molecular precision tools in pediatric nephrology. The Administrative Core facilitates consultation
with experts in study design and analysis to achieve appropriate inferences from observational
data, and in this proposal, to design comparative effectiveness studies and pragmatic clinical
trials. The Administrative Core will support the Opportunity Pool Pilot and Feasibility Program, the
Enrichment Program, and two Research Projects that apply innovative approaches to the data
resources of the LHS Core and NIDDK consortia (CKiD and CureGN) to address clinically
important evidence gaps. One project will examine comparative effectiveness of balanced fluids
versus normal saline to reduce the risk of acute and chronic kidney diseasein children with sepsis.
The second project will develop, test, and apply a novel class of marginal structural models to
estimate time-varying treatment effects on different types of recurrent time-to-event outcomes,
including proteinuria remission, infection-related acute care, and skeletal fracture. The PCEN will
build upon the strong foundation of pediatric nephrology research at CHOP and Johns Hopkins
University as well as successful collaborations with other pediatric nephrology centers and adult
nephrology colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. We will amplify these interactions across
institutions to accelerate translation of discoveries into therapies for children and young adults
with kidney disease."

Annotations of coding genes in the human genome have been tremendously useful in understanding etiology of
genetic disorders and in basic biology research. Despite being the most accurate and comprehensive set of
genomic features annotated, emerging evidence has indicated that an increasing number of translated regions
are missing from the current annotation. These overlooked genomic regions, or formally translated open reading
frames (tORFs), represents important biology missing from the current literature. For example, myoregulin, a
conserved 46 amino acid micro-peptide was discovered in a “non-coding” region, and was later demonstrated to
function in regulating skeletal muscles in mice. These potentially functional novel tORFs are often small, and
therefore overlooked by most coding gene annotation programs. To overcome this challenge, efforts leveraging
functional genomics datasets to identify novel coding regions across the human genome have begun to reveal
this previously underappreciated class of genomic features. In particular, the applicants previously developed a
computational method, riboHMM, which leverages patterns specific to the translated regions in functional
genomics data, such as ribo-seq data, in order to identify tORFs genome-wide. Using riboHMM to systematically
annotate tORFs in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, 7,273 novel tORFs were found, in addition to the tORFs of
known coding genes. These novel tORFs were found in regions of the transcriptome previously annotated as
non-coding (e.g. Untranslated Regions and lincRNAs). Although newly developed methods, such as riboHMM,
can now systematically identify thousands of previously overlooked tORFs, the biological relevance of these
translation events remains unclear. The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate functional relevance for
these newly discovered tORFs. Three major aspects of biological importance will be evaluated. First, loss of
function impact. Effects of tORF deletion on cell viability and synthetic fitness impact in combination with well-
characterized coding genes will be evaluated using pooled CRISPR dropout screens (Aim 1). Second, ability to
encode protein/peptide. The ability of tORFs to produce stable protein/peptide will be evaluated in mass
spectrometry studies designed for detecting translation products of small ORFs (Aim 2). Third, evolution
conservation. The strength of purifying selection on these loci will be carefully evaluated using new alignments
created based on independently annotated novel tORFs in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. The completion
of the proposed aims will provide the first systematic evaluation of biological relevance for novel tORFs. Impacts
of these new functional annotations could range from providing new interpretations for GWAS hits to reevaluating
“non-coding RNA” function. Results from the proposed study will guide future research directions on this group
of previously overlooked genomic features. Given the sheer number of unexplored tORFs and the prior examples
of overlooked tORFs that turned out to play critical roles in important biological pathways, the findings here will
have far reaching implications for both basic and translational biomedical research."

Washington University Therapeutics CRS have been members of the HVTN and ACTG since the inception of
these Networks in 1987-1988. The Vanderbilt Therapeutics CRS joined the ACTG in 2000. To contribute more
broadly to the Networks, Washington University has provided protocol-specific enrollment to the HPTN since
2016, and proposes to become a full member site of the HPTN, as the Washington University Prevention &
Therapeutics CRS. Leaders of this CTU have made high-impact scientific and programmatic contributions to the
Networks in areas that include human genomics, contemporary HIV-associated comorbidities, neurological
aspects of HIV disease, immunology of vaccine response, and beyond. During the proposed funding period, the
Vanderbilt CTU will continue to make substantial contributions to the ACTG, HVTN and HPTN's scientific
priorities. ACTG sites at both Vanderbilt and Washington University will focus on strategies to improve the health
of people living with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis. The Vanderbilt HVTN site will contribute both
study participants and cutting-edge immunologic technologies to further the major scientific priority of developing
and testing a safe and effective vaccine for HIV. The Washington University site will additionally contribute to
HPTN's emphasis on long-acting agents for pre-exposure prophylaxis, developing multipurpose technologies
such as combining HIV prevention with contraception, and strategies integrating biomedical, behavioral and
structural interventions for prevention. All CRSs of this CTU have an established record of success in enrolling
participants to clinical trials and conducting studies with utmost fidelity to ensure participant safety and quality

10748290,"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and
disposition
Abstract
Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials.
Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how
lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the
regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding
genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered
and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion)
chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more
than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through
interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance
lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME
chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and
transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three
specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of
lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional
characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer
chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance
lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters.
Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a
major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor-
mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the
development of chemo-resistance."

This is a K-01 application for Esra Karakose, PhD. Her overarching goal is discovering novel therapeutic
approaches for diabetes. This proposal investigates the role of epigenetics in the control of human beta cell
replication, aiming to identify novel pathways and drug targets that will enable human beta cell regeneration.
Candidate. Dr. Karakose is a junior faculty member (Instructor) at the Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism Institute
at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She holds a M.Sc degree from Bilkent University, Turkey, and a
Ph.D degree from the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Germany. Her extensive experience in
molecular biology and genetics as well as the expertise she developed in beta cell biology during her postdoctoral
work have prepared her to successfully accomplish the objectives of this proposal. Her career development plan
includes four training goals all which will be instrumental to help her transition into an independent research
career: 1) Acquire advanced programming skills to better analyze and interpret data; 2) Gain hands-on
experience in single cell RNA-seq experiments and data analysis; 3) Develop Chromatin Conformation Capture
experiments and apply bioinformatics analysis; and, 4) Develop writing and leadership skills.
Mentors/Environment. Dr. Karakose will be mentored by her primary mentor, Dr. Andrew Stewart, and two
additional very accomplished and complimentary scientists. Dr. Martin Walsh is a prominent scientist in genetics,
epigenetics and pharmacology, and Dr. Sebra is a pioneer in next-gen sequencing technologies and analysis.
Mount Sinai provides state-of-the-art lab facilities as well as a highly dynamic scientific environment, thereby
creating an excellent opportunity for Dr. Karakose to thrive as a researcher.
Research. Current approaches to reverse beta cell loss in diabetes are limited: islet transplantation, whole
pancreas transplantation and stem cell-based strategies for transplantable beta cells. However, many hurdles
are associated with these approaches, including an insufficient number of organ donors, immune rejection, lack
of successful implementation in the case of stem cell-based strategies, and excessive cost. A promising
alternative is beta cell regenerative drug therapies. This proposal will be key to understand the mechanisms of
actions of the current beta cell regenerative drugs, all of which work through mechanisms involving beta cell
epigenetics. Moreover, it will provide crucial information for identifying novel drug targets for beta cell
proliferation. Aim 1 will define the open chromatin regions and histone mark signatures in of human pancreatic
beta cells treated with regenerative drugs. Aim 2 will determine epigenetic properties of proliferating beta cells
with single cell approaches. More specifically, Aim 2a will define the transcriptomes of the subset of human
pancreatic beta cell populations with the proliferative capacity, whereas Aim 2b will define 3D chromatin
architecture in proliferating human pancreatic beta cells."
10747930,"Abstract
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts over 1.7 million persons per year in the U.S. alone, resulting in
substantial economic burden annually. To date, despite promising pre-clinical data, no new pharmacological
strategies have demonstrated improved patient outcomes in a phase III clinical trial. One significant and often-
overlooked pitfall of pharmacological strategies is the use of systemic administration of free drug, where toxic
and/or negative side effects may limit the therapeutic threshold at tissue targets. Nanoparticles (NPs) have
emerged as an ideal approach to address such drug delivery obstacles. Our long-term goal is to engineer NP
delivery systems to improve outcomes in TBI. Here, we will focus on developing a mechanistic understanding
of sex-dependent differences in pathophysiology that lead to altered NP delivery to the injured brain of male
versus female mice. Our group recently demonstrated that a TBI provides a unique window to deliver NPs to
the parenchyma within both of these BBB disruption events. We discovered a sex-dependent response in BBB
disruption and subsequent NP delivery profiles, whereby the BBB of females remained open for longer and to
a greater extent than males. There is limited understanding of how sex hormones influence TBI induced BBB
disruption over the longer term and the potential impact it has on drug delivery. To address this unmet need,
we will directly examine the influence of sex hormones on TBI pathophysiology and drug delivery, and we will
develop new strategies for targeting sex-dependent injury microenvironments. Our studies will address both
mechanistic and therapeutic goals, focusing on NPs composed of poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-
PEG) and loaded with the histone deacetylase inhibitor quisinostat, which we have already shown are
neuroprotective following TBI in mice. We will leverage our existing experience with bacteriophage biopanning
to identify sex-targeting ligands to enhance drug delivery to unique, hormone-dependent post injury
microenvironments. We hypothesize that differences in NP delivery to male and female mice can be attributed
to sex hormone-dependent contributions to TBI pathophysiology, and we predict that improving our
understanding of these sex differences will enable us to design more effective NP delivery systems. We will
probe this central hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the contribution of hormone
mediated sex-dependent injury sequelae on BBB disruption and inflammation, (2) Establish the relationship
between hormone mediated sex-dependent injury, drug delivery, and efficacy, and (3) Demonstrate feasibility
of sex-specific targeting for NP and drug delivery to TBI. Impact from these studies includes deepened
mechanistic understanding of sex-dependent responses to TBI with response to nanoparticle drug delivery, as
well as the first exploration of sex-targeted drug delivery to the brain. This will contribute to a thorough
understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI and more broadly the potential to exploit inherent biological
complexities for developing NP-based drug delivery strategies in context of brain injury."
10754230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Strategies for effective management of HIV care and prevention exist, however many evidence-based
interventions, such as Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), are not sufficiently scaled into practice, failing to reach
those most in need. Implementation science (IS) seeks to bridge the gap between research and practice to
ensure that evidence-based interventions are translated effectively at scale. IS methods are rapidly evolving;
trainees require mentors with dedicated time and research platforms to offer opportunities to learn and apply IS
methods as they work towards independent research careers. In this proposal Dr. Sheri Lippman, Associate
Professor in Residence at UCSF, proposes to: 1) expand her mentoring program, including formal training to
attain mentoring competencies, to improve the breathe and depth of the training she offers early career
scientists; 2) expand her own program of stakeholder-engaged IS research focused on means to improving
PrEP delivery to populations who are underserved through addressing clinic- and health system-based barriers
to care; and 3) provide early career scientists in UCSF programs and collaborating research institutions abroad
with a platform to train in IS methods. Dr. Lippman has built a research portfolio focused on social-behavioral
intervention development, supporting individuals and mobilizing communities to uptake HIV testing, prevention,
and care, mostly in Brazil and South Africa. The patient-oriented research in this K24 includes exploring
contextual domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to characterize the
PrEP delivery context in clinics attending transgender women (TGW) in São Paulo, Brazil, and clinics attending
adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Agincourt, South Africa (Aim 1). The work then includes
stakeholder engaged processes to arrive at a proposed set of implementation strategies to improve PrEP
service delivery that facilitates PrEP uptake and maintenance based on the taxonomies from the Expert
Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) Project (Aim 2). Finally, strategies will be piloted at one
clinic in each site to assess feasibility, acceptability, and monitoring processes to prepare for larger trials
(R01s) that evaluate whether selected strategies improve PrEP delivery, uptake, and maintenance. The
research focuses on PrEP delivery for TGW in Brazil and AGYW in South Africa as both are populations who
have high HIV incidence, poor engagement in HIV care, and low uptake of PrEP despite stated interest in use.
Dr. Lippman has extensive collaborations, including NIH-supported work, in both areas and can ensure
abundant opportunities for mentoring and stimulating new research among early career investigators in the US
and both countries. In sum, this K24 provides an opportunity for Dr. Lippman to expand her IS research to
address barriers to PrEP delivery in the clinic and health-system environment through implementation
strategies tailored to each site, concurrently building her mentoring program to ensure a pipeline of
investigators with skills to establish new careers and scientific inquiry in the burgeoning field of IS."

The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is a major health concern in immunocompromised and
critically ill patients, manifesting as a variety of pulmonary conditions ranging from acute to chronic. In these
clinical syndromes, A. fumigatus elicits a diverse adaptive CD4 T cell response, but the mechanisms by which
these varied responses are induced remains unknown. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are crucial for
sensing and initiating immune responses to this fungal pathogen and are the likely mediators of diverse T cell
responses to A. fumigatus. Recent studies have established the transcriptional basis for cDC heterogeneity
through single cell analyses, specifically demonstrating a division in the cDC2 population, which are considered
the canonical antigen presenting cells, expressing MHC Class II and priming CD4 T cells. We now separate
cDC2s into two novel subsets—cDC2A and cDC2B—based on differential expression of the transcription factors
T-bet and RORγt, respectively. In addition, the anatomic positioning of cDC2s is known to facilitate spatial
colocalization with pathogen-derived products allowing for efficient pathogen sensing, antigen uptake, and
subsequent CD4 T cell activation. Based on the pathogenic properties of A. fumigatus and recent discoveries of
cDC2 heterogeneity, our specific hypothesis is that cDC2A and cDC2B subsets will localize differently in
lung and draining lymph node and facilitate different adaptive CD4 T cell response types to A. fumigatus.
In this study, we investigate cDC2 subsets’ functionality in a clinically relevant murine model of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the temporal and spatial dynamics of cDC2 subsets
during acute A. fumigatus infection by applying high-content immunofluorescence methods and flow cytometry.
We will also assess cDC2A and cDC2B functional properties in vitro. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the
direct impact of cDC2 subsets on adaptive immunity in A. fumigatus infection by implementing genetic tools to
specifically ablate cDC2A and cDC2B subsets and establish their functional significance in vivo. In addition, by
investigating spatial reorganization of other immune cell subsets in subset-specific ablation of cDC2A and
cDC2B, we can identify their significance in cellular circuits governing lung immunity. This study employs and
develops novel genetic tools, microscopy methods, and computational approaches to generate a systems level
understanding of lung immunobiology and study host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, this proposal is
tailored for a physician-scientist in training, as it investigates the basic features of and mechanisms by which
cDC2 subsets induce adaptive immunity to the clinically relevant pathogen A. fumigatus, with implications for
anti-fungal therapeutic strategies and vaccine development."
10747329,"Project Summary/Abstract: Amphetamines (AMPHs) are psychostimulants commonly used for the
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. They are also abused, with devastating outcomes. The abuse potential
of AMPHs has been associated with their ability to cause mobilization of cytoplasmic dopamine (DA), leading to
an increase in extracellular DA levels. This increase is mediated, at least in part, by the reversal of the DA
transporter (DAT) function, which causes non-vesicular DA release (DA efflux). This DA efflux is thought to be
essential for the psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPHs, a notion supported by evidence that specific
inhibition of DA efflux impairs the ability of AMPH to cause locomotor behaviors. To date, no pharmacotherapies
are available for the treatment of AMPHs abuse. Therefore, it is essential to understand: a) the molecular
mechanisms targeted by AMPH to promote DA efflux; b) whether DA efflux disrupts DA functions in brain, and
whether these disruptions support AMPH-induced behaviors; and c) how we can target these mechanisms to
impair DA efflux to regulate AMPH behaviors.
 Previously, using a combination of biochemistry, electrophysiology, as well as behavioral assays, we and
others have shown that the DAT N-Terminus (NT) is a critical structural domain for the ability of AMPH to promote
specific behaviors. This is because AMPH stimulates DAT NT phosphorylation, which is vital for its ability to
cause DA efflux. Furthermore, we provided the first evidence that the human DAT (hDAT) NT engages in direct
associations with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, syntaxin 1
(Stx1), and that this interaction, in addition to hDAT phosphorylation, regulates AMPH-induced DA efflux and
behaviors. This was the first demonstration that the interaction of a plasma membrane protein with Stx1 is
essential for psychostimulant behaviors. Noteworthy is that our data suggest that the strength of this interaction
is regulated by AMPH-induced phosphorylation of Stx1.
 We hypothesize that the functional and behavioral role of the hDAT NT phosphorylation is dictated by its
interactions with the plasma membrane protein, Stx1, a process regulated by the phosphorylation status of Stx1.
 We propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) to determine how hDAT interacts
with Stx1; 2) to determine the involvement of Stx1 in AMPH-induced DA efflux. The molecular discoveries of
S.A. #1 and S.A. #2 will be evaluated in neurons, in isolated Drosophila brains, and behaviorally, by using
Drosophila as an animal model to study AMPH actions. We are now able to “humanize” flies by expressing hDAT
in DA neurons of Drosophila lacking the endogenous DAT (KO). In this system, we have established that AMPH-
associated behaviors, such as locomotion and grooming, are DAT-dependent. Also, in this animal model, we
can now determine preference (reward) and avoidance for AMPH. Thus, specific aim 3) is to determine whether
hDAT NT-Stx1 interactions are required for AMPH-induced behaviors."

Innovation Hub brings together experts from distinct fields–-LD and neuropsychology, child psychiatry,
cognitive neuroscience, public health and environmental science–-to improve our etiologic understanding of
environmentally-associated learning difficulties (LDiff), defined both dimensionally and categorically by
performance in the lowest quartile on standardized measures of reading and math. Our study includes Black
and Latinx children from economically disadvantaged families—populations at high risk for prenatal exposure
to neurotoxic chemicals and learning problems, who have historically been excluded from research. The Hub
will establish infrastructure to (a) foster innovative research into the complex etiology and neural underpinnings
of environmentally-associated LDiff in the context of economic adversity, and (b) train future interdisciplinary
LD scholars and leaders in cutting-edge neuroscience and to engage with the wider child educational
system. The Hub will document how prenatal environmental chemical exposures contribute to the achievement
gap in the United States. Long term, the Hub will help close the achievement gap by identifying behavioral and
neural pathways from prenatal exposures to LDiff—pathways that may be amenable to change.
The Embedded Research Project will identify neural and cognitive pathways through which prenatal exposure
to air pollution and early life stress (ELS) lead to LDiff in a sample of Black and Latinx children and
adolescents. We will use novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of neuromelanin, a by-product of midbrain
dopamine, and model-based functional MRI to probe dopaminergic circuits and related inhibitory control (IC)
and reinforcement learning (RL) in relation to prenatal exposure. We hypothesize that midbrain dopamine
serves as a critical mechanism mediating air pollution and ELS effects on domain-general cognitive factors (IC
and RL) and LDiff. The Leadership Core will establish the Hub's administrative and training infrastructure and
foster the next generation of interdisciplinary LD researchers, trained in public health and LDiff through an
innovative program including neuroscience research experience, methodological and translational coursework,
mentoring and interdisciplinary practicum training in the educational setting. We continue our commitment to
the recruitment of early career scientists from underrepresented groups, preparing them for research and
leadership positions in LD. IMPACT: Through our innovative, high-risk project and integrated
training/mentorship opportunities we will identify novel circuits and potentially modifiable
environmental risk factors implicated in LDiff in children from economically disadvantaged families.
We will develop an intellectual and administrative infrastructure to serve as a foundation for a future
Center for Environmental LD Research, capable of translating our research findings into actionable

Loneliness, or the feeling of distress that accompanies perceived social disconnection, confers significant risk
for negative physical and mental health outcomes, such as chronic disease, depression, and self-harm.
Adolescence is a period of increasing loneliness and thus a critical time to identify risk and protective factors.
Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate higher rates of loneliness than the typical
population, making them especially vulnerable to these negative outcomes. While developmental research has
identified peer relations as risk and protective factors in typically developing (TD) populations, gaps remain in
our understanding of how peer relations relate to the development of loneliness in ASD. Thus, understanding
the mechanisms that confer risk and protection in the development of loneliness in adolescence, and whether
they differ in high-risk populations, is critical to effectively intervening and ameliorating loneliness before the
onset of significant deleterious consequences. Research in adults points to several cognitive and neural factors
associated with loneliness and social connection: social-cognitive systems, social reward systems, and
dissimilarity from others. These brain mechanisms are also atypical in ASD and posited to relate to atypical
social interaction. The current proposal will test a novel biopsychosocial model of the development of
loneliness in which these posited neural mechanisms serve as predictors in the development of loneliness via
their effects on social experiences. In our model, peer relations may confer both risk and protective factors
between social experience and the development of loneliness. We will test this model using a prospective-
longitudinal design to follow 75 ASD and 120 TD adolescents mean-matched in age and IQ, and followed
every four months for twenty months. Importantly, this project will be the first to integrate across these neural,
cognitive/affective, and behavioral levels of analysis to investigate risk and protective mechanisms in the
developmental emergence of loneliness in adolescents with TD and ASD, and to examine whether these
mechanisms differ between groups. The current proposal is innovative in its use of ecologically valid,
naturalistic, and social-interactive fMRI approaches that the PI Dr. Redcay has developed. Further, the
proposal builds on existing work from co-Is Drs. Shackman and Lemay and Consultant Dr. Silk to use
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to obtain real-world, in-the-moment assessments of social
experiences and their effects on mood and loneliness. These contributions will be significant to the scientific
field and relevant to the strategic mission of NIMH because they will provide novel, critical missing information
on the developmental trajectory of loneliness in ASD and will identify mechanisms of risk for and protection
against loneliness outcomes. Knowledge gained from this project has direct implications for treatment
interventions to mitigate the experience of loneliness and associated negative outcomes in high-risk
adolescents with ASD and TD."

 Significance: Our study will rigorously evaluate whether synchronous, within-visit telemental health
evaluation and intervention services can successfully overcome poor access to behavioral health and
substandard suicide-related care in emergency departments (EDs), including evaluating the impact on system
metrics, a primary goal of RFA-MH-20-226. Notably, our study will surpass this primary requirement, because it
will extend our understanding of the relative added value of the ED-SAFE post-visit telephone intervention and
will create knowledge about key factors related to implementation and sustainment.
 Investigators: The team has extensive expertise in healthcare systems-based suicide prevention using
continuous quality improvement implementation strategies (Boudreaux, Larkin, Miller), telehealth for behavioral
health disorders (Boudreaux, Davis-Martin, Brown, Allen), using “big data” for outcome and intervention target
ascertainment (Mathew, Liu, Li, Clements), and implementation science (Boudreaux, Larkin, Davis-Martin).
 Innovation: This will be the first study to evaluate telehealth for suicide prevention in the ED. It will use best-
practices in both telemental health and suicide prevention and is designed for rapid dissemination. Our study
design, an interrupted time series with a nested RCT and parallel Non-intervention control EDs, embodies cutting
edge implementation science methodology. Our analyses are modeled after NIMH's experimental therapeutics
paradigm, allowing us to evaluate intervention targets appropriate for healthcare service delivery studies.
 Approach: We will compare three conditions across two Intervention EDs that currently do not have on-site
behavioral health specialists: (1) Treatment as usual (TAU), (2) Telehealth to Improve Prevention of Suicide
(TIPS), which will include within-visit telehealth components only, and (3) TIPS+EDSAFE, which will include
within- and post-visit components. Aim 1 will evaluate whether TIPS alone improves primary system metrics and
suicide-related care practices compared to TAU. Aim 2 will compare 12-month patient outcomes, including a
suicide composite outcome, across TAU, TIPS, and TIPS+EDSAFE. Aim 3 will evaluate factors related to
implementation and sustainability, including costs. Two Non-intervention EDs will be monitored to control for
macro system changes and secular trends. Existing big data sources, augmented by structured chart review,
will be leveraged for efficient outcome ascertainment that maximizes sample representativeness.
 Environment: UMass has demonstrated its ability to support this study by its success with the NIMH-funded
System of Safety (SOS) study, a Zero Suicide pragmatic clinical trial, in addition to its successful telehealth
efforts funded through NIH and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 Impact: The TIPS will address numerous fundamental questions around the role of telehealth in suicide
prevention in a highly efficient, pragmatic clinical trial, maximizing the study's scientific and public health impact
and building a singular database that will serve as an enduring resource to the suicide prevention community."

 The cancer care delivery system frequently provides care that is not patient-centered, evidence-based,
or accessible to vulnerable and underserved populations. Cancer care and outcomes are particularly poor for
patients living in rural areas, areas with high poverty, racial/ethnic minorities, and patients with multimorbidity.
Recent advances such as genomic testing, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and CAR T cell therapy have
made oncology care more complex. Concurrently, there has been substantial integration and consolidation of
the delivery of cancer care, and little is known about how consolidation impacts cancer care and outcomes.
 As part of an Agency for Health Care Research and Quality initiative on Health Systems Organization
and Performance, our team created a novel national database (Enhanced DataBase [EDB]). The EDB
combines a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental proprietary sources to identify health systems
as groups of commonly owned providers and contains microdata on physicians, physician practices, hospitals,
and health systems.
 We propose to leverage longitudinal data from the EDB to characterize the integration of cancer care
over time, using these changes to understand effects on care delivery, including quality, diffusion of new
therapies, utilization, and outcomes. We will study care for patients enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare and
those enrolled in Medicaid. In addition to studying claims-based measures of quality and utilization, we will link
with clinical data about genetic testing and test results from Foundation Medicine, one of the country's largest
providers of somatic genomic testing. Specifically, we will:
1. Describe changes in integration and ownership of oncology care providers since 2010 and assess
 differences in these trends for providers serving large numbers of vulnerable or disadvantaged populations,
 including rural and urban poor patients, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals with multimorbidity.
2. Leverage changes in the organization of care to assess the impact of integration and health system
 affiliation on quality of care, outcomes, utilization, and spending for patients with cancer. We will examine
 quality across multiple domains, including care coordination, guideline recommended care, avoidance of
 low-value care, and patient experiences.
3. Understand the extent to which quality and value of cancer care delivered within vs. outside of integrated
 systems differs for various disadvantaged populations, including individuals living in rural and urban poor
 areas, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals with multi-morbidity.
 Our study will provide oncology practitioners, payers, and policy makers valuable information to
improve access, quality and outcomes of oncology care. Our results will inform policies and practices related to
the value of integration of oncology care, quality measurement, and design of alternative payment models."
10738275,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have identified a group of genome instability configurations called the Tandem Duplicator Phenotypes
(TDPs) that are found in ~50% of triple negative breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers and are characterized
by the massive genome-wide distribution of somatic tandem duplications (TDs) of specific span sizes. We have
identified the bona fide genetic drivers of these configurations, demonstrated that loss of Trp53 and Brca1 in the
mouse mammary gland is sufficient to induce tumors with the short-span TDP configuration found in TP53- and
BRCA1-deficient human cancers, and shown that upon loss of Brca1, TDs are formed through the aberrant
repair of stalled replication forks. Here, we propose to deploy a combination of computational analyses, in vivo
modelling and in vitro experimentation to achieve a deep mechanistic understanding of how the distinct TDP
genomic configurations emerge and impact the course of breast tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will investigate
the molecular mechanisms leading to de novo TD formation across the different TDP groups by exploring how
local DNA features associated with DNA replication and fork stalling contribute to the generation of new TDs
across a large pan-cancer dataset representing all TDP groups and all TDP genetic drivers (Aim 1A) and how
loss of BRCA1 activity may modulate the spread and location of the de novo TDs formed in the context of the
short-span TDP (Aim 1B). We will establish new genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of breast
cancer to validate that activation of the Ccne1 pathway or loss of Cdk12 activity, both in conjunction with Trp53
loss of function, induces medium- and long-span TDP configurations that mimic their human counterparts both
in terms of TD span size and distribution (Aim 2A) and of the genomic features and genetic elements that are
associated with and affected by TD formation (Aim 2B). We will also assess the tumor neo-antigen load of the
TDP tumors emerging from the newly developed GEMMs and test whether immuno-oncology agents are
effective against mammary tumors with the TDP configuration, as suggested by recently emerging clinical
observations (Aim 2A). We will then use isogenic human cancer cell lines that are either proficient or deficient
for BRCA1 activity, to determine the dynamics of de novo TD formation under different modes of cellular
perturbation and as a function of BRCA1 status (Aim 3A). Finally, we will use the newly developed GEMMs to
understand the evolutionary path to genome-wide TD distribution in the mammary gland, and to discern the
dynamics of TDP emergence, both in terms of the rate of de novo TD formation and with respect to the timeline
of breast tumorigenesis (Aim 3B). If successful, this proposal will uncover the root causes of a significant form
of genomic instability in human cancer, the TDP, define the mutational dynamics leading to cancer formation in
this condition, and generate model systems that can lead to the development of new and directed therapeutics
against cancer growth."

address many of the targeted high priority areas of the four NIAID proposed Networks. Aim 1: Identify
novel and durable interventions to reduce reservoirs and control HIV replication in the absence of ART (ART-
free remission) (ACTG Aim 1 and IMPAACT Aim 2). Aim 2: Advance ART of pregnant and postpartum women

10747313,"Use of the non-dominant left hand is critical for individuals who suffer chronic impairment of the dominant right
hand due to unilateral conditions such as peripheral nerve injury. (This project will study right-handed
individuals, and thus uses ""right hand"" instead of ""dominant hand."") Most rehabilitation focuses on restoration
of function, but many patients never achieve this: 64,000 people per year in the USA have nerve injury to the
right hand but achieve satisfactory recovery, and these patients must learn to compensate by using the left
hand. However, the neural mechanisms of left hand compensation remain unknown. Our preliminary data
suggest that compensation involves interhemispheric mechanisms: the left hemisphere's mechanisms are
recruited to support the ipsilateral left hand. However, this mechanism has never been assessed with
neuroimaging during the left hand precision movements that would engage such a mechanism, nor in the
context of hand usage choices (left vs. right) during unconstrained reach-to-grasp action.
Our short-term goal is to identify interhemispheric mechanisms that support left hand compensation (both
performance and use), and determine whether the mechanisms arise from cortical asymmetry for movement
(hand dominance). This will provide the foundation for our long-term goal to develop and target therapies to
improve compensation for patients who face challenges to rehabilitation due to chronic right hand impairment.
Our patients will be individuals with chronic forced use of the left hand due to unilateral upper extremity
peripheral nerve injury. We will compare them with healthy patients in one fMRI study with 3 Aims:
 Aim 1: identify interhemispheric mechanisms that support left hand performance after right hand injury. We
 expect left hemisphere activity to correlate with left hand performance in fMRI, in patients > controls.
 Aim 2: identify interhemispheric mechanisms that support left hand usage after right hand injury. We expect
 left hemisphere activity to correlate with left hand usage outside fMRI, in patients > controls.
 Aim 3: determine whether the interhemispheric mechanisms arise from cortical asymmetry. We expect the
 mechanism to depend on hemisphere-specific specializations. Specifically, for patients who retain some
 function of their injured right hand, we expect that ipsilateral brain involvement will be demand-correlated
 during left hand action > during right hand action.
These findings will establish a mechanistic understanding of the interhemispheric cortical mechanisms of left
hand compensation. These mechanisms are the necessary foundation for future development of interventions
such as targeted neuromodulation, and precision-medicine prediction of which patients will benefit from
compensatory therapy. Moreover, our findings will establish a healthy-brain mechanism for the changes
following chronic forced use of the LH, which can serve as a baseline for future studies of central nervous
system conditions (e.g. stroke) that include chronic forced use."
10749902,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a rare degenerative disease characterized by progressive lung stiffening, resulting in
death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Compelling clinical evidence show that mutations of the epithelial cell-
specific gene encoding surfactant protein-C (SP-C), are linked to a particularly extreme lung phenotype.
Progression of PF in humans is often punctuated by inflammatory bursts, clinically termed “acute exacerbations”,
that drastically accelerate the disease and reduce life expectancy. In accord with this notion, monocyte
mobilization and the persistence of monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung are strong predictors of PF
severity. Several environmental factors have been proposed to promote and accelerate acute inflammatory
exacerbations of PF; however, the exact mechanisms have not been interrogated. The ubiquitous air pollutant
ozone (O3) represents a major, and unavoidable, environmental contributor to pulmonary disease through
oxidative stress and monocyte/macrophage rich inflammation. To closely mimic causes of human PF, we
developed a novel mouse model that develops spontaneous lesions over time, as a result of inducible ectopic
expression of the most common PF-linked SP-C mutation (SP-CI73T). This preclinical model provides a unique
platform to decipher mechanisms of PF progression and specifically the roles of acute exacerbations (induced
by O3), infiltrating monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages in promoting PF. Our published work showed
that SP-C mutation is accompanied by a dynamic monocyte/macrophage inflammatory response, initiated by
the epithelium. Preliminary evidence confirm that O3 exposure amplifies inflammatory cell influx and pro-
inflammatory signaling in SP-C mutant mice, worsening PF. Assessment of the proposed paradigm will provide
fundamental data to define the responses of the healthy, acutely inflamed, and fully fibrotic lung to environmental
exposure. Our hypothesis is that O3-induced acute exacerbation of PF driven by SP-C mutation enhances the
recruitment and activation of inflammatory monocytes, triggering a monocyte-derived macrophage pro-fibrotic
response. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Define monocyte dynamics following O3-induced pulmonary inflammation
and PF. 2) Investigate the role of monocyte-derived macrophages and O3-induced exacerbation of PF; and 3) :
Establish the role of monocyte subpopulations in the PF phenotype."

GENOMIC BIOMARKERS OF SPLENIC LYMPHOMA
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is the most common form of primary cancer in the spleen. SMZL
typically involves the bone marrow and peripheral blood (PB) at presentation. The diagnosis is invariably
established in late stages of disease via a splenectomy which is a surgical procedure carrying major risk.
Additionally, the diagnosis of SMZL is subjective because there are no specific histopathologic or
immunohistochemical biomarkers of the disease. Consequently, early diagnosis of SMZL is challenging and
not achieved in most clinical scenarios. Further, SMZLs are among the least reproducibly diagnosed category
of lymphomas. The suboptimal diagnostic accuracy necessitates the development of qualitative and objective
biomarkers of SMZL. Importantly, while all cases of SMZL are characterized by PB involvement at diagnosis,
however this biologic feature has not been leveraged for the reliable early detection of the disease. Using
whole genome and exome sequencing, we and others defined the genomic landscape of SMZL and identified
recurrently mutated genes in SMZL. An unmet clinical need is the development of reliable biomarkers for the
early and accurate diagnosis of the disease based on the characteristic genomic alterations of SMZL. We
propose in this application to develop a genomic-based approach that utilizes and validates peripheral blood as
for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease. The overall impact of the application is the establishment of a
paradigm for early, sensitive and accurate disease diagnosis by analysis of peripheral blood, thereby
permitting early and appropriate treatment for the disease."
11174144,"ABSTRACT
 Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate unequivocally that several isoforms of small conductance Ca2+-
activated K+ channels (SK or KCa2 channels) underlie Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK,Ca) in cardiomyocytes. Since
our original reports, knowledge of cardiac SK channels in the field has been greatly expanded. Studies by our
group and more recently by others, have provided evidence to substantiate the important roles of SK channels
in the heart. Interests in cardiac SK channels are further fueled by recent studies suggesting the possible roles
of SK channels in human arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, SK channel may represent a novel
therapeutic target for atrial arrhythmias. Moreover, SK channels are upregulated in heart failure (HF). To our
knowledge, they are the only K+ channels that are upregulated in HF, underpinning the importance of this class
of channels in normal and diseased hearts. Significant gaps in our knowledge and seemingly contradictory
findings on SK channel function in cardiac disease mechanisms are our motivations for the next grant cycle.
These are the challenges: 1) Blockade of SK channels has been shown to be both anti-arrhythmic and
proarrhythmic in various models; and 2) SK channels are upregulated in HF. However, the mechanisms for the
observed upregulation remain incompletely understood. Thus, this multidisciplinary proposal will combine
experimental and computational studies, taking advantage of complementary expertise from four different
laboratories in functional studies, optogenetic tools, and computational modeling to successively address the
multifaceted SK channel remodeling in diseased hearts. SK current is enhanced during -adrenergic (-AR)
stimulation, especially in female animals, therefore, the sex-specific roles of SK channels will be tested. The
proposed study represents the necessary and critical steps to disentangle the highly complex and sex-specific
SK channel remodeling in HF, the unique K+ channel that helps to compensate for the much-needed
“repolarization reserve” in HF."
10744756,"Project Summary
This revised renewal application requests funding for years 15-19 for a proposal that is devoted to
understanding the impact of genetic hypomorphs of the p53 tumor suppressor on cancer risk and therapy.
The central premise is that the analysis of cancer-associated genetic hypomorphs of the p53 tumor
suppressor can lend critical insight into the key functions of this tumor suppressor in cancer. The proposed
research focuses on the African-specific Pro47Ser p53 hypomorph (hereafter S47) that exists in over
800,000 African-descent individuals in the United States and confers increased cancer risk in these
individuals. The S47 variant of p53 is defective in the transactivation of a small subset of p53-target genes,
particularly those that confer sensitivity to ferroptosis. The overarching hypothesis of the proposed
research is that by understanding the biology of P47S and other cancer-associated hypomorphs, two
important outcomes are met: the first is the identification of key tumor suppressor functions of p53, which
are still not known. The second is that we can use mouse models in order to better understand cancer
risk, and uncover superior cancer therapies, for the individuals who possess these variants.
In Aim 1 we will investigate our finding that the tumor micro-environment in S47 mice is more immuno-
suppressive, due to increased accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs are
potent immunosuppressive cells that directly limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We will
test the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in WT and S47 mice, and we will test combination therapy
in which we target MDSCs. In Aim 2 we present data that P47S, like two other cancer-associated p53
hypomorphs Y107H and G334R, has impaired ability to transactivate the chromatin modifier PADI4, along
with increased propensity to misfold and adopt a mutant p53 conformation. We will investigate the
relevance of both activities to tumor suppression by p53. In Aim 3 we provide PheWAS data indicating
that the S47 allele is a highly significant risk factor for bladder cancer in African Americans (p< 6x10-6, OR
7.5). In this aim we investigate the function of S47 in mouse models of bladder cancer, with the goal of
better understanding the reasons underlying this significant association. We then follow our published
successful protocols to identity novel chemotherapeutic drugs that show improved efficacy in S47 bladder
cancer, compared to WT. The combined studies build upon a wealth of published and preliminary data,
along with novel mouse models for p53 hypomorphs and the integration of human data throughout. These
studies are paramount for our long term goal of understanding the genetic basis of minority cancer
disparities, and improving personalized medicine approaches for individuals of African descent."

One of the major recent scientific breakthroughs was the emergence of super-resolution optical nanoscopy.
Nanoscale optical imaging currently plays a crucial role in biomedical sciences and has provided invaluable
information about the cellular structure and function at the macromolecular scale. However, the potential of this
technology can be immensely enhanced. We propose to develop and optimize a new class of spectroscopic
super-resolution imaging tool, referred to as spectroscopic single-molecular localization microscope or sSMLM.
It will allow biomedical researchers, for the first time, to achieve multi-color imaging with molecular specificity at
sub 10-nm spatial resolution with principally unlimited number of distinguishable molecules. We will develope
the sSMLM with modular optical designs and open-source data processing software. The unique spectral
analysis optical module will be compatible with existing commercial SMLM systems with minimal or no system
modification. The new hardware and software development together with optimized experimental protocols will
ensure maximal accessibility of sSMLM by the broad biomedical research community. We anticipate that sSMLM
will push the envelope of super-resolution imaging in fundamental biological research beyond current static
spatial analysis of only few (<4) molecules."
10861713,"Two-thirds of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) occur in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), with 5-year survival rates of only 10-40%. The poor survival rate in LMICs is due to late
diagnosis and treatment. Thus, it is imperative to detect potentially malignant lesions early and expeditiously.
To meet the need for oral cancer screening in low resource settings (LRS), we will develop and validate a low-
cost mobile phone-based imaging device powered by computer vision and deep learning image classification
algorithms to guide patient triage. We are a multi-institutional team comprising of optical imaging and
machine learning engineers and oral/head-neck oncologists, at the University of Arizona, Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center and Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH, Mumbai, as the LMIC setting). In preliminary
studies, our team has developed and tested the hardware: a dual-mode polarized white light imaging (pWLI)
and autofluorescence imaging (AFI) mobile device. Non-expert field healthcare workers read images with (low)
sensitivity of 60%. Additionally, a preliminary deep learning classification algorithm, implemented on a cloud-
based server computer, demonstrated improved sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 82%. Our proposal is to
address the key remaining hurdle – improving the reading skills of non-expert field healthcare workers – locally
in LRS in LMICs, which do not have internet and cloud connectivity. We will develop and validate the required
software: machine learning (deep learning) image classification algorithm on a mobile phone, to guide field
healthcare workers in triage of oral lesions into benign (patients can go home) versus suspicious (patients
referred to clinician for follow up care). The innovations will be in design and integration of computer vision
(image mosaicking) and deep learning classification algorithms on a mobile phone-based imaging device, to
provide high accuracy and consistency for screening. Novel aspects will be in (i) the deep learning approach
for dual-mode image contrast: pWLI contrast for color and texture of normal features (increasing specificity)
and AFI contrast associated with malignancy (increasing sensitivity) and in (ii) engineering of the algorithm for
use on mobile devices, via teacher student learning-based knowledge distillation techniques The clinical
innovation will be first-in-humans testing for improvements in sensitivity and specificity relative to that of purely
visual interpretation, for routine use by non-expert field healthcare workers in LRS. In the R21 project, we will
develop a mobile deep learning-based oral lesion screening and patient triage algorithm and demonstrate
feasibility in a cancer care setting (TMH’s main hospital in Mumbai). In the R33 project, we will optimize the
algorithm, test and validate in a large study in a field setting at TMH’s regional clinic in Varanasi. Successful
completion of this project will deliver urgently needed capabilities to field healthcare workers in LRS, for early
detection and triage of oral potentially malignant lesions, improving early oral cancer detection rates, allowing
timely referral to specialists, improving treatment outcomes and improving quality of life for patients in LMICs."

10744783,"The overall goal of the Laboratory Center (LC) is to provide the leadership, structure, oversight and execution of
high-quality, state-of-the-art laboratory-based research studies on behalf of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network
(HVTN) that will accelerate the development of a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine. Within this framework, the
LC will also contribute to developing other strategies to prevent HIV (e.g., immune prophylaxis), as well as to
advancing vaccines to prevent M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and other infections of public health importance.
For more than a decade, our LC has directed HVTN laboratory studies through the application of innovative
science and a rigorous lab quality management program. We have overseen the clinical and largely performed
the specialized lab studies globally to broadly define the adaptive, and when relevant, the innate and mucosal
immune responses induced by candidate HIV vaccines tested from first-in-human to large-scale efficacy trials.
We have determined how prime-boost combinations, delivery route and schedule can impact these responses.
The development and use of validated and qualified assays have enabled reliable quantitative assessments and
direct comparisons of functions and specificities across different vaccine platforms. This unique capability in the
field has informed go/no-go decision-making and prioritization of vaccine candidates and specific regimens to
advance to large-scale testing. Our HVTN LC has been at the forefront to define experimentally the correlates
of risk and protection induced by vaccination, and potential explanations for failed or modest efficacy in the Step
Study, HVTN 505, and the RV144 Thai Trial. The LC is now poised to lead lab investigations in five ongoing
global phase 2b/3 HVTN vaccine and HVTN/HPTN immune prophylaxis studies. Through these efforts, the LC
has elevated the standards and feasibility of conducting groundbreaking studies in human immunology in the
global setting and enriched its science through a wide network of collaborations.
Over the next seven years, we propose to build upon and enhance our current scientific and operational
infrastructure to execute innovative HVTN studies in a good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) setting that will
provide unambiguous measurements of vaccine immunogenicity, vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy and
insight into correlates of protection (Aims 1, 3, 4) in adults and children (when indicated). To improve monitoring
tools, we will continue to develop, optimize and validate assays that can reveal the broad range and distribution
of immune functions that candidate agents elicit and in additional compartments beyond blood (Aims 2, 5). We
will embrace collaborations among the larger HIV, TB and immunology fields to enhance these efforts (Aim 6)
and will continue to provide leadership and expertise to facilitate investigations with other HIV clinical trials and
vaccine networks. Headquartered at FHCRC, the Laboratory Center will integrate its activities seamlessly with
the HVTN Leadership and Operations Center and the Statistical and Data Management Center, and
cooperatively with the DAIDS Vaccine Clinical Branch."
10744217,"Ferroptosis is a regulated form of lipotoxic cell death that involves iron-dependent generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the accumulation of oxidatively damaged lipids (e.g. lipid
peroxides). Ferroptosis has been implicated in the etiology of degenerative diseases, such as
neurodegeneration associated with iron accumulation. Cells contain a protective pathway in which
the glutathione-dependent peroxidase GPX4 repairs lipid peroxides and blocks cell death.
Targeted induction of ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 has proven to be an efficacious treatment in
in vitro and in vivo models of cancer, including drug-resistant forms of cancer. Despite the
excitement from these recent findings, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
ferroptosis remains limited. Furthermore, many cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis and the
mechanisms of ferroptosis resistance in cancer remains mostly unknown. To overcome this
critical gap in knowledge, we performed a synthetic lethal, whole-genome CRISPR screen to
identify factors that protect cancer cells from ferroptosis. Our findings identify the lipid droplet
oxidoreductase AIFM2 as a key factor that promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer. Deletion of
AIFM2 dramatically sensitizes cells to ferroptosis and AIFM2 levels correlate with cancer
resistance across hundreds of cancer lines, indicating that AIFM2 is a biomarker of ferroptosis
resistance and suggesting that it is broadly involved in ferroptosis resistance across many types
of cancer. Our proposed research builds on our discovery and employs a combination of
functional genomic, cell biology, and biochemistry strategies to achieve the following goals: 1)
elucidate the mechanism by which AIFM2 prevents lipid damage and ferroptosis, 2) define the
relationship between lipid droplets, fatty acid metabolism, and ferroptosis, and 3) identify new
factors involved in protecting cancer cells from ferroptosis. These goals are potentially
transformative because they focus on new mechanisms of ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells
that act in parallel to the canonical glutathione-based protective system."
10739316,"Project Summary
The CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complexes regulate many important biological processes such as DNA
replication, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation. We
recently found that CRL4 also regulates the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) through important stem cell proteins such as SOX2 (SRY-box2). SOX2 is a dose-dependent
master transcriptional factor that plays a key role in regulating the self-renewal and pluripotency or
multipotency of ESCs, iPSCs, and many fetal and adult stem cells. In ESCs, an increase of SOX2
promotes development into ectoderm and mesoderm lineages, while loss or reduction of SOX2
induces differentiation into endoderm and trophectoderm lineages. Even at the 4-cell embryonic stage,
the heterogeneous binding of SOX2 to target genes determines the first lineage decision. In human,
loss-of-function mutations on a single Sox2 allele is sufficient to cause the familial
anophthalmia/microphthalmia syndrome associated with seizures, brain abnormalities, slow growth,
delayed motor skills and learning disability. Conversely, gene amplification and over-expression of
SOX2 are frequently associated with many poorly differentiated cancers including lung, esophagus,
brain, and breast cancers. However, it remains unclear how the SOX2 protein level is regulated in
various stem/progenitor cells during development and tissue homeostasis. We recently found that the
protein stability of SOX2 is regulated by a novel CRL4-based proteolytic mechanism using lysine
methylation as a proteolytic trigger in ESCs and other related cells. Genetic mutation of this particular
CRL4 function impairs embryonic development. We propose to unravel the function and regulation of
this novel and important CRL4-based proteolytic mechanism in regulating self-renewal and
pluripotency of ESCs and during embryonic development. Our specific aim 1 is to define the roles of
CRL4-based ubiquitin E3 ligases that target the methylated SOX2 protein for degradation. Our specific
aim 2 is to determine how the levels of methylated SOX2 proteins are dynamically regulated during
the self-renewal of ESCs. In our specific aim 3, we propose to examine how the function of SOX2 is
regulated in animal development using specific genetic mutants defective in the methylation-
dependent proteolysis pathway. Since SOX2 is central to many stem cells and pathological loss or
elevation of SOX2 levels underlies many diseases, our studies should reveal a novel paradigm by
which the self-renewal and pluripotency or multipotency of various stem cells are regulated."
10759445,"This proposal outlines the scientific agenda of the Leadership and Operations Center of the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network (HVTN), the collaboration of physician scientists at 64 clinical trial sites in 15 countries on 4 continents
dedicated to developing a globally effective HIV vaccine. During the current funding period, the HVTN has
transformed HIV prevention science by taking two HIV vaccine concepts and the broadly neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (mAb) VRC01 from phase 1 to efficacy evaluation. We have added over 35 clinical trial sites in sub-
Saharan Africa and now have over 12,500 participants enrolled in randomized controlled efficacy trials.
We propose to continue our scientific leadership in HIV vaccines. The scientific pipeline for vaccines with the
potential to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV has markedly expanded. This proposal
describes a novel fast-track phase 1 program to assess, in an iterative fashion, candidate trimers, germline or
lineage-based vaccines designed to elicit bnAbs in adults. A phase 1 program to investigate these vaccines in
HIV-1–exposed infants is also proposed. The HVTN currently has five HIV efficacy trials in place. Two vaccine
trials (HVTN 702 & 705) are in progress; a third (HVTN 706) will start in August 2019; and we are collaborating
with the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) on two antibody-mediated prevention (AMP) trials evaluating the
infusion of passively administered mAbs. These efficacy trials will define the potential of neutralizing and/or non-
neutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV acquisition. The samples and statistical design of the efficacy trials are
developed around correlates of protection; we will continue to develop the robust integrated laboratory, statistical
and computational platform needed to define these correlates. We will also continue to expand our behavioral
sciences program to enhance our already successful recruitment and retention programs, and to continue to
expand the enrollment of persons of color and transgender persons into HVTN trials.
Vaccine clinical trials involve a complex interplay between clinical trial sites, HVTN laboratories, computational
scientists, and our operational, training, mentoring, and fiscal management teams; these interactions are
described in the application. The clinical, laboratory and statistical infrastructure we have built for HIV vaccines
will also be used to assist in tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development. Importantly, we will build on our success in
the unique community-based programs and integration of community representatives and community advisory
boards into HVTN research process and conduct. We will also continue to develop the next generation of vaccine
scientists and expand our scientific collaborations to engage the scientific community to utilize the extensive
specimen and data repositories we have established. The overall goal of the HVTN in this proposal is to develop
a vaccine regimen or combination mAb regimen that will reduce HIV acquisition in adults and infants by more
than 60 percent."
10749905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This application proposes to investigate the newly discovered function of histone H3 as an oxidoreductase
enzyme, catalyzing the reduction of cupric (Cu+2) ions to the biousable cuprous (Cu+1) form. The eukaryotic
histone H3-H4 tetramer contains a putative Cu2+ binding site at the interface of the apposing H3 proteins with
unknown function. The coincident emergence of eukaryotes with global oxygenation, which challenged cellular
copper utilization, raised the possibility that histones may function in cellular copper homeostasis. We have
extensive evidence that histones are required for efficient use of copper inside cells, which depend on availability
of copper ions in their reduced, +1 oxidation state. It is the Cu+1 ions that are trafficked intracellularly by protein
chaperones to destination target proteins. We show that the H3-H4 tetramer, assembled from recombinant
histones, binds Cu2+ and catalyzes its reduction to Cu1+ in vitro. Loss- and gain-of-function mutations of the
putative active site residues correspondingly altered copper binding and the enzymatic activity, as well as
intracellular Cu1+ levels and copper-dependent activities such as mitochondrial respiration and superoxide
dismutase 1 (Sod1) function in S. cerevisiae. Our data have uncovered a function of the histone H3-H4 tetramer
with little precedence in literature, revealing that the eukaryotic genome is wrapped around an enzyme. We now
propose to develop a mechanistic understanding of this new function of histones and how it is regulated and
linked to cellular copper homeostasis. In Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanism of catalysis by
determining the structure of copper-bound H3-H4 tetramer and the contributions of the residues in and around
the active site. In Aim 2, we will discern how the enzyme activity is regulated, especially through post-translational
modifications of histones and certain histone variants. The enzymatic activity of histones indicates that there
must be a previously undiscovered biological network that shuttles Cu2+ to histones and then distributes the
reaction product (Cu1+) to different parts of the cell for use by proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm and
mitochondria. In Aim 3, we plan to systematically identify the protein effectors involved in this novel copper
biological network in yeast by utilizing a high-throughput CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) technology. We aim
to identify the genes and pathways that integrate the enzymatic activity of histones with other cellular functions.
Our proposal will begin to build the scientific foundation for understanding chromatin structure and function as
an enzyme and its impact on eukaryotic biology with instructive consequences for the evolution of the eukaryotic
cell as well as a range of human pathologies such as cancer and neurodegeneration in which copper
homeostasis is altered."
10991546,"Oral cancer, including cancers of the mouth and the back of the throat, is the sixth most common cancer
worldwide. In the United States, approximately 50,000 new oral cancer cases are diagnosed each year. First-
line treatments for oral cancer typically include surgery and radiation, with chemotherapy added to decrease
the possibility of metastasis, to eliminate residual tumor cells after surgery, to enhance the efficacy of radiation
(chemoradiation), and for patients with confirmed distant metastasis. Radiation and oral cancer
chemotherapeutics confer cytotoxicity largely by disrupting DNA replication to induce DNA damage.
Unfortunately, the prognosis of oral cancer, particularly HPV(-) cases, remains relatively poor, calling for a
better understanding of how cells respond to replication stress and DNA damage, and accordingly, developing
more effective treatment options and combinations to overcome drug resistance. In the current project, we
characterize a new role of Greatwall (Gwl) kinase in the replication stress and DNA damage responses. Gwl
was frequently upregulated in HPV(-) oral cancer, in correlation with cancer progression, tumor recurrence,
and poor patient survival. Gwl promoted the recovery and resistance of oral cancer cells to drugs that induce
replication stress and DNA damage. Gwl depletion or inhibition sensitized the drug responses in oral cancer
cells and mouse tumor models. Building on these findings, we hypothesize that Gwl mediates the cellular
responses to replication stress and DNA damage, and is therefore a potent target for oral cancer therapy. We
will uncover detailed mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of Gwl in the replication stress and
DNA damage responses; we will also establish the crucial proof-of-principle for the development of Gwl
targeting in cancer treatment. In Aim 1, we will delineate how Gwl is recruited to stalled replication forks via its
interaction with replication protein A (RPA) to regulate a phosphatase-mediated response to replication stress.
This study will shed new light on cancer progression and treatment, given that replication stress is a hallmark
of cancer, and that anti-replication drugs are commonly used in cancer therapy. In Aim 2, we will reveal a new
mechanism that leads to Gwl stabilization and accumulation after replication stress and DNA damage,
potentially as a key event that initiates cell recovery and confers tumor resistance. Upregulation of Gwl is
mediated directly by DNA damage signaling, suggesting a self-engaged “timer” mechanism that initiates cell
recovery and treatment resistance. Finally, guided by our mechanistic investigations, we will explore in Aim 3
therapeutic targeting of Gwl, using unique small molecule inhibitors which interfere with either Gwl kinase
activation or its interaction with RPA. Both patient-derived oral tumor xenograft and orthotopic syngeneic oral
tumor models will be utilized to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic potential of Gwl inhibition. Together,
this project will lead to a deeper understanding of the cellular responses to replication stress and DNA
damage, and characterize a new drug target to improve oral cancer therapy."

 The PI Batista from Yale and co-investigators (Lisi, Brown University, and Palermo, UC Riverside) will
investigate allosteric pathways in the CRISPR-Cas9 system – composed of the multi-domain endonuclease
Cas9 in complex with RNA and DNA. The system allows for studies of long-range signaling critical for allosteric
mechanisms that achieve enhanced selectively and tunability of the protein/nucleic acid complex response.
CRISPR-Cas9 is an innovative therapeutic tool with widely demonstrated capabilities for genome editing. An
outstanding challenge of great research interest is to develop a detailed understanding of allosteric signals in
CRISPR-Cas9 responsible for the DNA editing capability. Such understanding would have profound implications
for bioengineering and precision medicine, as well as for establishing modern paradigms of allosteric regulation
in protein/nucleic acid machines. A substantial hurdle in investigating the mechanisms of large protein/nucleic
acid complexes is the inherent difficulty of adapting experimental and computational methodologies to capture
the intrinsic flexibility of these structures essential for functionality. We propose to implement a synergistic
approach of solution NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) in combination with established and novel methods for
analysis of allosteric networks to elucidate the structural and dynamic determinants of allosteric signaling in
CRISPR-Cas9. We have recently identified a pathway of dynamic communication connecting multiple domains
of Cas9 through millisecond timescale motion that spans its critical nucleases, consistent with a regulatory signal
proposed through experimental characterization. Thus, the following hypotheses guide our specific aims: (i) A
well-defined allosteric pathway controls the CRISPR-Cas9 functionality; (ii) The allosteric interplay between
spatially distant protein domains activates the DNA nuclease function; (iii) Modulation of the allosteric motions
through the mutation of critical residues achieves altered specificity; and (iv) Dynamically-driven signaling is an
intrinsic property of protein-nucleic acid macromolecular complexes. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Characterize
the allosteric control of the HNH nuclease; Aim 2: Determine the allosteric pathway from HNH to RuvC and the
allosteric role of the PAM recognition sequence; and Aim 3: Characterize the effect of mutations on the allosteric
pathway. The research program involves multiple cycles of an iterative approach where, in each cycle, allosteric
pathways are explored through the analysis of differential motions probed by liquid-NMR relaxation methods and
computation (MD and network analysis), obtaining valuable information on key amino acid residues and specific
interactions responsible for transmitting structural or dynamical changes spanning the allosteric and active sites.
The resulting insight provides guidelines for the next round of studies of mutants and modulators in a joint
experimental and theoretical effort to elucidate the CRISPR-Cas9 allosteric mechanisms."

 Hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen (O2) carriers (HBOCs) are currently being developed as red blood cell
(RBC) substitutes for use in transfusion medicine. Despite significant commercial development, recent late
stage clinical results of polymerized hemoglobin (PolyHb) solutions (i.e. Hemopure (OPK Biotech,
Cambridge, MA), a glutaraldehyde polymerized bovine Hb; and PolyHeme (Northfield Laboratories Inc.,
Evanston, IL), a glutaraldehyde polymerized pyridoxylated human Hb) hamper further development. Both of
these commercial products elicit vasoconstriction at the microcirculatory level, and lead to the development of
systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue damage. These side-effects are hypothesized to occur either by a
nitric oxide (NO) scavenging or oxygen (O2) oversupply mechanism, and are both exacerbated by PolyHb
extravasation into the tissue space. In light of these 2 potential mechanisms, it is apparent that PolyHb size will
have a profound impact on the extent of vasoconstriction, systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue toxicity.
 However, commercial PolyHb products are complex mixtures with broad size distributions defined only by
the size cutoff of the ultrafiltration membranes used in their manufacture. Furthermore, these mixtures are
known to contain up to 1% of individual tetrameric Hb molecules and a significantly higher proportion of lower
molecular weight (MW) Hb oligomers (80% with MW < 500 kDa). Hence, the side-effects observed during
clinical/pre-clinical trials are attributed to a mixture of low MW Hb polymers with different sizes and points of
chemical modification, and not to any one, single PolyHb molecule. This precludes precise characterization of
how individual components of these complex PolyHb mixtures interact with the vasculature.
 An important advance would therefore be the ability to produce molecularly uniform, monodisperse, and
high MW PolyHb nanostructures. In this application, we hypothesize that the molecular diameter and
topology of recombinant PolyHb (rPolyHb) will regulate vasoactivity and oxidative injury to tissues. To
test our hypothesis we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Use orthogonal split splicing inteins to produce well-defined, monodisperse, high MW
rPolyHb nanostructures.
Specific Aim 2a: Analyze the role of endothelial function on the development of vasoactivity and oxidative
tissue injury to rPolyHbs of varying size.
Specific Aim 2b: Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rPolyHbs in normal guinea pigs and HFSD guinea
pigs.
Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the ability of rPolyHbs to restore tissue oxygenation and optimize survival in
severe blood loss.
 The proposed work is both significant and innovative, since it seeks to develop safe and efficacious
rPolyHbs for use in transfusion medicine. In addition, state-of-the-art biophysical techniques and two unique
animal models will be used to understand rPolyHb physiological responses and determine the clinical potential
of these novel materials."
10778551,"Gene silencing using small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a viable therapeutic approach but, limited in translation
due to lack of effective delivery systems. Developing effective and non-toxic delivery system will translate siRNA-
based therapeutics to clinics. Here, using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models, we propose to develop
a new type of siRNA delivery system for effective gene silencing and therapeutic applications.
 We recently reported that MICU1, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, functions as a metabolic
switch that promotes glycolysis and therapy resistance in ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, lack of pharmacological
inhibitors and effective strategies to silence MICU1 in vivo posit a significant challenge against future clinical
translation of MICU1-targeted therapy. Therefore, MICU1 could serve as a new therapeutic target to validate
silencing and therapeutic efficacy of our new siRNA delivery platform and provides opportunity to normalize
aberrant metabolism responsible for therapy resistance. Hence, we plan to develop a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-
based liposomal formulation (AuroLiposome) for siRNA delivery to effectively silence MICU1 in vivo.
 To effectively silence MICU1 in vivo we have developed DOPC-DOTAP based conventional
nanoliposomal siRNA delivery platforms (MICU1 siRNA-cLPs). Interestingly, AuNP (20 nm size)-doped
formulation (MICU1 siRNA-AuroLPs) exhibited enhanced efficacy in silencing MICU1, requiring 3-4-fold lower
siRNA concentrations than MICU1 siRNA-cLPs or commercially available transfection reagents such as
Hiperfect, RNAiMax and Lipofectamine 3000. Enhanced silencing was reflected in clonal growth assays; MICU1
siRNA-AuroLPs inhibited clonal growth of HGSOCs more efficiently (~90%) than MICU1 siRNA-cLPs (~50%) or
Hiperfect (~30%). Importantly MICU1 siRNA-AuroLPs inhibited tumor growth more effectively (~75%) compared
to MICU1 siRNA-cLPs (~35 %). Importantly, using chemical inhibitors we showed that incorporation of AuNP
switched intracellular uptake pathway of MICU1 siRNA-cLPs from a combination of clathrin and caveolar
mediated endocytosis to mostly caveolar uptake pathway. Hence, we hypothesize that incorporation of AuNP in
nanoliposomal formulation triggers caveolar uptake of AuroLiposome (AuroLPs) resulting in reduced degradation
of siRNA-AuroLPs in lysosome and thus enhancing silencing efficacy. We will use specific aims below to test
the hypothesis and accomplish overall objectives;
Aim1: Determining mechanisms of enhanced gene silencing efficacy due to gold doping.
Aim 2: Determining pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of the optimized nanoformulation.
Aim 3: Determining therapeutic efficacy in patent derived xenografts (Pdx) and syngeneic mouse model.
Successful completion of the project will provide a generalized siRNA delivery approach for any in vitro and in
vivo gene silencing applications and a potential translatable strategy to normalize aberrant metabolism to
overcome therapy resistance against high grade serous ovarian cancer."
10747948,"Hyperphosphatemia is a major cause of cardiovascular complications such as cardiovascular calcification in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD causes a severe imbalance of phosphate homeostasis through
the disruption of two phosphaturic hormonal axes, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23
(FGF-23). PTH and FGF-23 reduce phosphate re-absorption mainly by increasing degradation of a proximal
tubule-specific Na-dependent type II phosphate transporter, NaPi2a. Although we understand that phosphate
homeostasis is regulated by a systemic feedback loop involving the bone, intestine, kidneys and parathyroid
gland, we believe that the initiation of CKD-mediated dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis occurs at the
kidney. Using a sequential RNA-seq and RNAi library screening, we have identified a novel candidate for
proximal tubule-specific regulation of phosphate homeostasis. The central premise of this application from our
preliminary results is that 1) the modulation of a novel proximal tubular-specific protein physically interacts with
NaPi2a and affects phosphate re-absorption by affecting NaPi2a stability, 2) the mice with a knockout of this
protein developed severe disruption of phosphate homeostasis, resulting in severe hyperphosphatemia and
vascular calcification by drastically increasing NaPi2a in the renal brush boarder membrane and 3) CKD
significantly reduces levels of this protein in the renal brush boarder membrane. This project is a collaboration
between experts with the biology of cardiovascular diseases (Miyazaki, PhD scientist) and phosphate
transporters (Blaine, MD/PhD scientist). We will employ an innovative panel of novel microscopic methodologies
and novel genetic mouse models to assess the role of the novel proximal tubule-specific protein in the regulation
of phosphate homeostasis and the pathogenesis of CKD-mediated hyperphosphatemia and vascular
calcification. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will identify mechanisms by which the proximal tubular-
specific protein regulates NaPi2a degradation in response to PTH and FGF23. Aim 2 will examine whether the
proximal tubular-specific protein contributes to CKD-mediated hyperphosphatemia and cardiovascular
completions. Completion of this project will provide a novel target of CKD-mediated hyperphosphatemia and
cardiovascular complications."
10749035,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The non‐coding (nc) transcriptome remains an under‐explored landscape for functional genomics. Recently,
~2,000 long non‐coding (lnc)RNAs were identified by the Steitz lab upon exposure of human cells to stress, such
as heat, high salt and oxidative stress, while others have confirmed their induction in viral infection, cancer and
aging. Called DoGs for “Downstream of Gene” transcripts, these lncRNAs result when RNA polymerase II fails
to cleave nascent RNA 3' ends at the annotated site for a subset of protein‐coding genes that we term “parent
genes”. Instead, transcription continues from 5 to 45 kbps further downstream, and DoGs are retained in the
nucleus. DoG RNAs are expressed on the timescale of minutes upon stress, suggesting they are among the “first‐
responders” to help cells survive. Total DoGs account for 15%–30% of all intergenic transcripts, yet they are not
even annotated in the human genome. Taken together, these features define an urgent need to determine the
sequence and function of DoG RNAs, which are central goals of this proposal. In Aim 1, we propose to sequence
individual DoGs from their 5' to 3' ends, using emerging long read sequencing methodology established for
polyA+ and polyA‐ RNA in the Neugebauer lab. We will exploit physiological stresses to induce DoGs by orders
of magnitude and optimize library preparation on several platforms to achieve the appropriate sequencing
length and depth for all of the parameters we aim to quantify. The data will reveal the actual lengths, 5' and 3'
ends and the extent to which DoG RNAs are spliced, modified and polyadenylated. Importantly, we will test
our working hypotheses based on preliminary results that splicing and histone post‐translational modifications
play mechanistic roles in DoG biogenesis. These findings will give us the first concrete clues regarding the
cellular machineries impinged upon by stress pathways. In Aim 2, we propose concurrent functional analyses of
DoGs that exploit our recent preliminary finding that DoG production by the mouse interferon‐β gene enhances
subsequent expression of interferon‐β upon exposure to polyIC (mimic of viral infection). Therefore, we will
ask whether other DoGs likewise prime expression of their parent genes upon exposure to a second stress. We
will pursue other preliminary results suggesting that DoG parent genes are associated with transcriptional
repression and that DoG production has the potential to up‐ or down‐regulate the parent gene. We will probe
the mechanism of action of DoGs through analyses of transcription elongation and the chromatin landscape in
DoG gene regions with new and published ChIP data. Finally, determination of DoG half‐lives before, during
and after stress will allow us to explore the conceptually novel possibility that DoGs are repositories for
unprocessed pre‐mRNAs that are later matured to become active mRNAs during recovery from stress. The
achievement of these aims will illuminate the sequences and function(s) of an entirely new class of ncRNA, as
well as the gene regions and chromatin environments where transcriptional activity is regulated by cellular
stresses. Moreover, entirely novel lncRNA‐mediated pathways of gene regulation are likely to be identified."
10762480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Peroxisomes are fundamental sub-cellular organelles present in all eukaryotic cells. Peroxisomes
participate in a number of biochemical pathways including catabolism of very-long-chain fatty
acids, branched chain fatty acids, and bile acids, the biosynthesis of plasmalogen lipids, and
mediate a number of crucial biological processes. Human diseases due to lack of peroxisomes
are severe multisystem diseases These conditions, called peroxisome biogenesis disorders,
Zellweger-spectrum disorders (PBD-ZSD) illustrate how peroxisomes are required for human
health. Insights from studies in PBD-ZSD have been applied to common disease such as
Alzheimer’s disease. In order to probe the molecular mechanisms that underlie PBD-ZSD I use
genomics, untargeted metabolomics and genetic technology in Drosophila. I am a dedicated
physician-scientist devoting my career to the study of PBD-ZSD, having made several
contributions. First, I have used metabolomics to define a pattern of biochemical abnormalities or
a “PBD-ZSD Metabolome” a characteristic signature of these diseases that interestingly includes
reduced sphingomyelins, a previously unrecognized biomarker of PBD-ZSD. Second, my lab has
used innovative genetic technology in Drosophila to further probe consequences of peroxisomal
biology for neurons. For example, in a large forward genetic screen on the Drosophila X-
chromosome we identified novel genes that alter peroxisomes in vivo and we have shown these
are candidate neurological disease genes. Finally, using genomics I have developed a track
record of diagnosing undiagnosed individuals who have novel or unique mutations in genes such
as ACOX1, DNM1L, PEX1 and PEX16, and these studies point to novel genetic mechanisms for
peroxisomal disease. Based on my studies of sphingomyelin I hypothesize that peroxisomal
dysfunction leads to altered composition of the side-chains of sphingomyelins resulting in
impaired neurological function in PBD-ZSD. I also propose, based on animal model studies that
peroxisomes are required both during development and during aging for nervous system function.
Finally, my preliminary data suggests that de novo mutations can impact peroxisomal genes,
which are traditionally considered “autosomal recessive” and can be an important mechanism for
peroxisomal disease. In this proposal we use clinical studies, unique model organism technology
and genomic and metabolomic technology to test these hypotheses and advance studies of PBD-
ZSD towards better diagnosis, treatment and improved quality of life for patients."
10770423,"ABSTRACT
Head and neck cancer is currently treated by concomitant chemotherapy and radiation, but local recurrence and
metastatic disease remain a concern. In particular, there is a pressing need to improve treatment for advanced
and metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), which has a median survival of 6 to 12 months,
even with aggressive chemotherapy, alone or combined with radiation or targeted agents. Checkpoint blockade
immunotherapies (CBI) with antibodies have been tried only to achieve a 20-30% response rate. Resistance to
immunotherapy in HNSCC is partly attributable to the comprehensive nature of immunosuppression, where the
blockade of one checkpoint can be counterbalanced by another negative regulatory pathway, and the transient
nature of target-antibody engagement, allowing rapid recovery of suppressive signals. Given these challenges,
siRNAs are considered a promising alternative to antibodies to enhance the benefits of CBI, based on modularity
of siRNA, enabling multi-targeted therapy, and the potential for RNA interference to provide long-lasting effects.
However, without a means for reliable tumor delivery, siRNA will remain sidelined for CBI and other targeted
cancer therapies. Developing a safe nucleic acid carrier that achieves favorable biodistribution and tumor cell
uptake upon intravenous injection would overcome the critical barrier to clinical translation of siRNA therapeutics
in cancer.
 The Objective of this study is to enable systemic gene delivery to tumors using Nanosac, a novel soft,
non-cationic polydopamine nanocapsule, which holds siRNA inside and adopts a corona of native albumin in
circulation. We produce Nanosac by coating mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with siRNA, then with pol-
ydopamine, and removing the sacrificial MSN core. Nanocore delivers siRNA and silences target genes with no
toxicity in vitro, binds albumin, and readily extravasates and penetrates into tumors, and suppresses tumor
growth as a systemic carrier of siRNA targeting PD-L1. Our Central Hypothesis is that while the cationic charge
and/or exposure of nucleic acid typical of conventional synthetic gene carriers compromise circulation time, de-
livery to tumors, and safety, Nanosac will overcome these challenges by its softness, encapsulation of siRNA
and the non-cationic, albuminylated surface. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three Specific Aims: (i) To
optimize design and production of Nanosac for multigene targeting; (ii) To define toxicity, pharmacokinetics (PK),
biodistribution (BD), and pharmacodynamics of Nanosac; (iii) To leverage systemic delivery of Nanosac and
tumor targeting by image-guided radiation. The Core Innovation of this strategy is that we have pioneered
Nanosac, a non-toxic, non-cationic, soft nanocapsule as a nucleic acid carrier, which overcomes limitations of
conventional gene carriers, which rely on cationic charges for loading and intracellular delivery. Thereby, we
have the potential not only to overcome the persistent challenge in systemic delivery of siRNA to solid tumors
but to open the door to a wide range of other gene-targeting strategies."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia causing a significant reduction of
quality of life of affected patients. In the brains of AD patients, β-amyloid (Aβ) was identified as the
main component of the amyloid plaques. Recently, deposits of Aβ have been documented in
peripheral organs in AD and we provided evidence that the heart is one of the affected organs. We
and others, have also shown that the complement system has a critical, non-redundant roles in
creating and maintaining a non-inflammatory intravascular environment by tagging and opsonizing
circulating foreign or abnormally folded host proteins with C1q, MBL, C3b and C4b. Importantly, free
Aβ42 binds 3 out of 4 CR1 (complement receptor 1) ligands namely C1q, C3b and C4b. In the
presence of complement Aβ42, binds CR1 on circulating RBCs. Unique to RBCs, the expression
levels of CR1 are genetically determined, with individuals expressing either 90 copies of CR1/RBC
(L/low), 500 CR1 copies (HL/intermediate) or 1200 CR1 copies (H/high expressers). Recently,
several reports using GWAS data, linked CR1 polymorphisms to an increased risk of late-onset AD,
lending credence to the role for RBCs in AD pathogenesis. In AD patients an abnormal clearance in
blood Aβ was recently suggested based on a shift in Aβ levels from liver to brain, heart and periphery.
Based on these observations, the overall hypothesis of this application is that the genetically
determined CR1 levels on circulating RBCs are critical in: a) binding and safely remove circulating Aβ
and b) preventing the cell-free Aβ to translocate to the RBC cytosol and be delivered via exosomes to
damage peripheral tissues such as the heart, leading to heart failure and, in turn, worsening AD. We
will test and validate this hypothesis by: A) Investigating the role of RBC-CR1 levels in the distribution
of Aβ in EVs, RBCs and free in blood. B) Defining the functional consequences of free vs. EVs bound
Aβ shuttling between brain and heart using a lox-cre mouse model, and C) Validating the role of
RBCs and EVs in AD pathogenesis using tissues samples from AD patients
 The results of this study support the future of use free and RBC-bound Aβ42 as biomarker
reservoirs to stage disease progression and therapeutic progresses."
10751036,"PROJECT SUMMARY :
Bacterial pneumonia kills more than one million infants around the world each year. Type 3 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC3) are critical for lung mucosal defense against bacterial pneumonia in the
newborns. However, the signals that guide pulmonary ILC3s development are incompletely
understood. A wave of ILC3s accumulate into the newborn lungs during the first week of life
contemporaneous with postnatal lung growth and colonization by commensal microbiota. Clinical
interventions in premature infants, for instance, the use of antibiotics alter microbiota and are
associated with decreased lung ILC3s and increased risk of pneumonia. Similarly, therapies such as
mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids interrupt the postnatal lung growth leading to
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Infants with BPD have decreased lung ILC3 and increased
likelihood of morbidity due to respiratory infections. Therefore, understanding this relationship is
clinically important. In published studies, we found that ILC3s localized to the alveoli in the newborn
lungs, where they intimately associated with a subset of Gli1+ stromal cells creating a pulmonary ILC3
niche. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 was an essential component of the pulmonary ILC3 niche. We
found that developmental signals operating in the niche cells instructed the differentiation and
functional fitness of lung ILC3. The convergence of postnatal lung growth and colonization by
commensal microbiota during the `critical window' of the newborn period allows the developing lung
and evolving microbiota to `instruct' rapidly maturing pulmonary mucosal defenses. Such convergence
ensures long-lasting protection against respiratory pathogens. We hypothesize that carefully timed
signals from commensal bacteria act cooperatively with developmentally programmed cues in the
unique lung niches to pattern the immune environment in the lung. The proposed studies will resolve
the following knowledge gaps regarding lung ILC3 development. 1) When is the lung ILC3 niche
endowed during development and how is it maintained throughout childhood (Aim 1)? 2) How does
ILC3 niche instruct the development, differentiation and functional fitness of lung ILC3 (Aim 2) ? 3)
How does the lung niche integrate the signals from commensal bacteria (Aim 3)?
Together, these aims will use developmentally appropriate models to answer a vital and unknown
question: how the newborn's lungs are seeded with ILC3 and how they are regulated at their lung niches
via local and extrapulmonary inputs throughout childhood."
10766127,"Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) significantly affects aging populations and results in functional
impairment. Although the clinical importance of finding efficacious interventions for PAD is well-recognized, few
medical therapies are currently available. PAD is diagnosed using the ankle brachial index (ABI), a measure of
blood flow to the lower extremities. Lower ABI is associated with worse function; however, low ABI alone
cannot fully explain functional impairments in PAD. Small studies have reported oxidative stress, mitochondrial
dysfunction and/or fiber damage in gastrocnemius muscle biopsies from PAD patients, suggesting skeletal
muscle perturbations may contribute to functional decline. We reported highly variable fiber type composition
and fiber type grouping in a small cohort of PAD patients, and observed lack of intermyofibrillar mitochondria
(IMFM-) in oxidative, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) type I fibers. We have provocative new preliminary data
suggesting variability in response to ongoing denervation, and in fiber type and mitochondrial adaptations, with
PAD. The purpose of this study is to define specific characteristics of muscle in PAD associated with impaired
walking performance through detailed immunohistochemical analyses of 400 baseline gastrocnemius muscle
biopsies stored in the Northwestern biorepository, collected from 9 different clinical trials. This biorepository of
muscle from PAD patients is one-of-a-kind and is associated with detailed clinical and functional characteristics
of the donors. We hypothesize that variability in fiber size, fiber type and mitochondrial adaptations in response
to ischemia-reperfusion damage and denervation in individuals with PAD will have value in predicting walking
impairment. In Aim 1, we will quantify the proportion of IMFM- areas in type I fibers with normal type I MyHC
abundance, or accumulation of type IIX MyHC and/or LC3, a marker of autophagy, and determine associations
with fiber type composition and fiber size, as well as relationships of muscle features to walking performance in
PAD. We hypothesize that LC3 will co-localize with IIX MyHC in IMFM- areas, suggesting both incomplete
autophagic clearance of IIX MyHC and mitochondrial biogenesis during fiber transition from type IIX to type I
as a result of denervation and reinnervation. In Aim 2 we will quantify denervated, NCAM+ fibers and fibers
with elevated oxidative damage markers by fiber type. We hypothesize that denervation in PAD will
preferentially affect fibers expressing IIX MyHC and that only IMFM- areas that accumulate IIX MyHC will be
NCAM+. In Aim 3 we will perform predictive modeling of PAD disease severity and functional impairment using
morphological characteristics of muscle quantified in Aims 1 and 2 as biomarkers in conjunction with
supervised classification approaches. In Aim 4 we will test the hypothesis that baseline muscle characteristics
will predict longitudinal functional outcomes at 6-month follow up. This model will provide a powerful tool to
aide in identifying biologic processes for targeted interventions and to assess the mechanism of action and
effectiveness of current pharmacological and exercise interventions in ongoing PAD clinical trials."
10747913,"This proposal brings together a unique interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise in high-LET
radiobiology, pancreatic cancer research, and high-LET physics. It leverages the engineered PDA (pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma) mouse models and imaging capabilities at our “PDA Mouse Hospital” together with the
high-LET charged particle beams generated at Brookhaven’s NSRL and our Radiological Research
Accelerator Facility (RARAF) at Columbia to address the central hypothesis that heavy ion radiotherapy
(HIRT) effects in PDA are LET dependent and can be enhanced by pharmacological induction of ferroptosis.
 HIRT represents a promising therapeutic opportunity for improving (PDA) survival, with very encouraging
survival results reported after combined carbon-ion and gemcitabine therapy for locally advanced PDA.
Compared with other radiotherapy modalities the high-LET radiations deposit energy far more densely
resulting in complex DNA damage, clustered reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and altered damage
signaling. The generation of clustered ROS by HIRT is clearly linked to cell killing, however, PDA upregulates
ROS detoxification pathways, potentially leading to mitigation of tumor cell killing by radiation. Our labs have
recently shown that pharmacological inhibition of cystine import counters PDA resistance to endogenous ROS,
triggering ferroptotic death in PDA cell lines and tumors, and resulting in significantly improved survival of
autochthonous PDA tumor bearing mice. The efficiency of lipid peroxidation, upon which ferroptosis depends,
varies with LET, suggesting that overcoming ferroptosis resistance in combination with optimized HIRT may
prove a powerful approach for PDA treatment.
 Thus our central hypothesis is that HIRT effects in PDA are LET dependent and can be enhanced by
pharmaceutical induction of ferroptosis. The goal is to understand and quantify PDA-HIRT relevant endpoints
using state-of-the art PDA mouse models in extended heavy-ion beams customized for mouse tumor
exposure, with and without pharmacological induction of ferroptosis. Our second goal is understanding the LET
dependencies of PDA-HIRT relevant endpoints: First to find the optimal dose-averaged LET (LETD)
corresponding to these endpoints, and second to assess whether clinical helium ion beams may induce similar
yields of these endpoints – a conclusion that would potentially revolutionize heavy ion radiotherapy.
 Our mouse irradiations will use custom extended heavy-ion beams at Brookhaven’s NSRL facility.
However, the LETD distributions within the irradiated mouse tumors cover a much smaller LET range than in
typical human tumors treated with HIRT. We will assess whether the conclusions drawn from these studies are
still valid at the higher LETs and lower LETs respectively of relevance for clinical carbon-ion and helium-ion
HIRT, by recapitulating relevant endpoints at RARAF, our preclinical heavy-ion irradiation facility where mono-
LET beams for cellular irradiations are available from 10 to 200 keV/m."

There is a paucity of information known about how the lung recovers from acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and pneumonia, and this knowledge gap has contributed to the continued high morbidity and mortality
of these diseases. A subset of immune cells, Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), is thought to be important
in resolution in several experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, Tregs are present in the
lung of patients with ARDS, suggesting that they contribute to ARDS recovery. Tregs can arise from either thymic
or extra-thymic origins. Extra-thymic, peripherally-induced Tregs (iTregs) are converted from naïve T cells and
serve distinct and essential functions in controlling adaptive immunity to restrain immune cell infiltrates in the
bronchial and bronchiolar walls. Furthermore, our published studies show that during the resolving phase of lung
injury, Tregs expand in number and change their gene expression profiles compared to Tregs in uninjured control
lungs. Treg transcriptome profiling identifies several genes that shine a light on novel functions of Tregs during
ALI resolution. One transcript that is markedly upregulated 23-fold in Tregs isolated from resolving lung tissue is
matrix metalloproteinase 12 (Mmp12). Importantly, mice lacking endogenous Tregs and repleted with Mmp12-/-
Tregs by adoptive transfer have elevated inflammatory cells and less epithelial proliferation during resolution
than mice repleted with Mmp12+/+ Tregs. The Treg transcriptome also suggests that downregulated expression
of Treg transcripts Kdm6b and Sik1, both of which act to regulate gene transcription, may function to regulate
Treg homing, retention, stability, and survival. The Aims seek to test the central hypothesis that Tregs are critical
to resolution and that by optimizing Treg responses, ALI severity can be reduced, and resolution hastened. Aim
1 investigates the role of iTregs during resolution of ALI resolution. The hypothesis is that iTregs are required for
optimal resolution of inflammation and lung repair after ALI induced by LPS, S. pneumoniae, and influenza A.
The direct effects of Tregs and iTregs will be determined using in vitro co-cultures of Tregs and AT2 cells. Aim
2 determines the impact of Treg-expressed MMP12 during the resolution of ALI. The hypothesis is that Treg
expression of MMP12 exerts multiple roles in orchestrating and facilitating the resolution of ALI. Substrates of
Treg MMP12 will be identified in BAL fluid and lung tissue. Aim 3 determines if the differentially regulated
transcripts, Kdm6b and Sik1, regulate Treg-promoted resolution of ALI. We will test the hypothesis that Tregs
deficient in Kdm6b have decreased Foxp3 expression levels and delayed, inadequate resolution and that Tregs
deficient in Sik1 have improved quality of resolution. We anticipate that the proposed studies will determine the
roles iTregs play in ALI resolution and identify mechanisms by which Tregs mediate resolution and repair.
Identifying and elucidating these mechanisms will allow the development of therapeutic approaches to minimize
collateral tissue damage without adversely altering the beneficial response to injury."

neuropathies, and carditis. It is apparent that genetically regulated responses of the host contribute to the
severity of symptoms. We have taken a forward genetics approach to identify allelic genes that determine the
difference in Lyme arthritis between the severely arthritic C3H mouse and the mildly arthritic C57BL/6 (B6)
mouse. This analysis has identified Quantitative Trait Loci on several chromosomes, including the Bbaa1 locus
on Chr 4, which encompasses the Type I IFN gene cluster. Congenic mouse lines in which the C3H Bbaa1
allele was introgressed onto the B6 background (B6.C3H-Bbaa1) confirmed the presence of a genetic element
in this locus that regulates arthritis through expression of IFNβ, a Type I IFN. As the C3H and B6 IFNβ genes
lack polymorphisms, any expression differences must be regulated by a linked genetic element. Advanced,
interval specific recombinant congenic lines (ISRCL) have narrowed the physical region associated with Bbaa1
to 2.2 Mbp and identified the Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitory gene, Cdkn2a, as a candidate regulator of
IFNβ expression and determinant of the severity of Lyme arthritis. A variety of experiments demonstrated that
the Bbaa1 impact on IFNβ expression was manifest through B. burgdorferi stimulation of myeloid cells, but that
an additional, downstream mediator of arthritis required distinct activation of resident cells of the joint tissues.
Independent studies characterized the arthritis-inducing activity of IFNβ as myostatin (MSTN). MSTN is well
characterize as modulating skeletal muscle development, but has also been implicated in chronic disease and
inflammation. We will utilize the B6.C3-Bbaa1 ISRCLs to characterize the mechanism by which products of the
Cdkn2a locus regulate IFNβ production in myeloid cells, and, in turn, the mechanism by which the downstream
effector MSTN modulates Lyme arthritis development. We propose a combination of lineage-specific
expression analysis, silencing of gene expression, development of targeted KO mice, and the use of small
molecule inhibitors in order to define the complex interactions involved in Lyme arthritis development. Our
findings may provide insight into other pathologies driven by Type I IFN, which could also implicate unexpected
pathways involving Cdkn2a and MTSN."

competencies also trained in patient-oriented research. My overarching goal is to grow the field of young
investigators properly trained in patient-oriented aging research, and to improve the health of frail, older adults
through my research efforts focused on unintentional injury. For more than ten years I have had funding from
the NIA to study injurious falls in frail, older adults, and for the past six years I have served as the Program
Director for the Harvard Multicampus Geriatric Medicine Fellowship. The current proposal will capitalize on my
strengths as an independent clinical investigator with expertise in injurious falls and program leader to enhance
my capacity to mentor early investigators in aging research. The specific aims of the current proposal are to 1)
conduct high-quality research on preventing unintentional injuries in frail, older adults that will serve as a
platform to engage early investigators in patient-oriented aging research; 2) grow the number of well-trained
investigators skilled in studying unintentional injury in older adults; and 3) enhance my skills to lead and mentor
early clinical investigators by completing formal didactic training focused on implementation science and
leadership. Ongoing funded research projects that could serve as a platform to engage research trainees
include a large observational study to determine the risks and benefits of antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic,
and anticoagulant drugs in older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), as well as a
feasibility trial to develop and implement an intervention to prevent injurious falls in older nursing home
residents. Additionally I have conducted research and continue to collaborate with investigators using several
large datasets that will serve as an excellent resource for trainees. Potential mentees will be identified from a
pipeline of existing training programs at Harvard Medical School including the Geriatric Medicine Fellowship,
Translational Research in Aging Programs (T32), and others. I will develop an individualized mentoring plan
with all trainees, including the design of an original hypothesis-driven research project, plan for individualized
and group mentorship, and opportunities for coursework/didactics to enhance research training. Finally, I will
boost my own mentoring skills through 1) formal didactics and directed reading on implementation science; 2)
directed reading/coursework on mentorship; 3) a leadership course; 4) a course on preventing burnout; and 5)
additional coursework (e.g., introduction to genetics) to expand my scientific inquiry. A Senior Advisory panel
will provide feedback on my performance as a mentor and leader. In summary, this Career Development
Award will provide me with the practical experience and formal didactic training to expand my capacity as a
researcher, leader, and mentor in patient-oriented research on unintentional injury, including patients with
ADRD. At the end of this 5-year award, I will have equipped at least 18 early investigators in the study of
unintentional injury, many of whom will enter the field of aging research."
10760329,"The overall goal of this work is to investigate lymphatic vascular mechanisms of tissue sodium handling using
novel, noninvasive imaging tools sensitive to sodium and lymphatics in patients with well-characterized lymphatic
disease. Findings are intended to inform mechanisms of lymphatic clearance of tissue sodium, and provide novel
imaging biomarkers of lymphedema progression and treatment response. Recent evidence supports that
lymphatics regulate interstitial sodium levels. When lymphatic clearance is impaired, hypertonic interstitial
sodium results in tissue swelling, skin sodium storage, and poor blood pressure control. When lymphatic
clearance is impaired in rodent models of lymphedema, lymph stasis and inflammation ensues, leading to tissue
remodeling and fibrosis. These data suggest, but do not confirm, that impaired lymphatic clearance contributes
to tissue sodium storage and fibrosis. However, this possibility has not been investigated rigorously owing to a
lack of clinically-feasible measurement tools sensitive to sodium and lymphatics in humans. To address this
need, we have developed noninvasive, in vivo MRI approaches to quantify lymphatic vasculature and dynamics,
and interstitial measures of tissue sodium content. We have applied a subset of these methods (i) in patients
with unilateral upper-extremity lymphedema and we confirmed lateralized lymph stasis and enlarged lymphatic
collector cross-sectional area that reduced following manual lymphatic drainage therapy, and (ii) in patients with
lower-extremity lymphatic impairment in whom we reported significantly elevated sodium in the skin and
subcutaneous tissue, compared to age-, BMI-, and race-matched controls. In preliminary data presented here,
we show that in patients with advanced lower-extremity lymphedema and fibrosis, sodium-rich tissue co-localizes
with subcutaneous fibrosis, and tissue sodium reduces following complete decongestive therapy (CDT). Here,
we will extend this work to test fundamental hypotheses regarding sodium storage, lymphatic dysfunction, and
lymphatic mobilization therapy. Hypothesis (1): In patients at-risk for secondary lymphedema, tissue sodium
content (TSC) is elevated and inversely correlates with lymphatic flow velocity. Hypothesis (2): Skin TSC
positively correlates with lymphedema stage; deep subcutaneous sodium co-localizes with fibrotic tissue in
patients with lymphedema and fibrosis. Hypothesis (3): TSC decreases and lymphatic flow velocity increases
after a course of CDT in affected limbs with lymphedema; imaging metrics do not change in a similar time-period
in healthy volunteers. Impact: Results will confirm how TSC relates to lymphatic dysfunction, and specifically
whether TSC can be reduced by manual stimulation of lymphatic channels. This will motivate early intervention
as a candidate treatment for reducing fibrosis onset, but more broadly will outline clinically-feasible biomarkers
of intervention response which could have significance for future clinical trials that seek to evaluate the impact
of emerging lymphatic therapies on tissue sodium storage."
10758551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many of the 54,000 opioid-related deaths in 2017 were due to respiratory depression. The specific
mechanisms by which opioids depress breathing are not fully understood. Current hypotheses focus on single
areas within the respiratory network, such as the pons or pre-Bötzinger complex. However, perturbation of
these areas has not fully predicted the actions of opioids to depress breathing. Based on preliminary data and
model simulations we have developed the following hypothesis: opioid administration induces
reconfiguration of the respiratory network in a dose-dependent manner. This reconfiguration involves
alterations in the pattern of discharge of some neurons (discharge identity), loss of synchrony among
interconnected inspiratory neuron networks in the ventral respiratory column (VRC) and altered
functional connectivity within and between respiratory areas in the brainstem. This project has three
Specific Aims: 1) Determine the influence of opioids on functional network interactions between neurons in
the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), raphe, pontine, and VRC that regulate motor output to respiratory
muscles, 2) Determine the role of opioids in modulating synchrony within inspiratory neuron circuits in the
VRC, 3) Generate a network-scale model of the brainstem circuits that control breathing in the presence of
opioids. We anticipate this project will lead to: a) identification of elements of the respiratory control network
that participate in opioid-mediated reconfiguration, b) delineation of functional relationships between E-T/NBM
in the pons, raphe, NTS area and VRC neurons that contribute to depression of breathing by opioids, c) the
role of impaired synchrony in inspiratory neuron networks in reduced motor drive produced by opioids, and d)
new predictive model will be produced featuring the network-scale mechanisms that contribute to opioid
depression of breathing. This new knowledge will provide a critical step in understanding the network scale
mechanisms of action of opioids to depress breathing."
10547805,"HIV vaccine candidates entering into clinical testing generally fall into three categories: 1) recombinant
envelope (Env) protein immunogens, 2) viral vectors, and 3) plasmid DNA. Numerous vaccine Env designs
are being tested in clinical trials. Likewise, numerous HIV vaccine inserts, such as mosaic sequences, have
been designed to induce broad, protective T-cell responses. However, to date, no specific vaccine regimen
has been able to initiate and expand broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) lineages in non-human primates or
humans, nor have induced durable antibody responses. Furthermore, the current platforms have multiple
challenges; the manufacturing processing for sequential protein vaccines may be complex and time-
consuming, viral vectors may have potential pitfalls of anti-vector immunity, and plasmid DNA may have the
need for complex delivery systems to enhance immunogenicity. These potential hurdles highlight the need for
a next generation vaccine platform that possesses favorable production, safety, and immunogenicity
characteristics such as nucleoside-modified messenger (m) RNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).
 To execute this project, we will select CDMO partners to manufacture two non-neutralizing
antibody(NNAb)-inducing gp120 mRNA immunogens (ADCC Mosaic or WT Env) chosen in overall Aim 1 for
use in a Phase I clinical trial that will start at the mid- to end of year 5 of this grant. By leveraging the existing
expertise for this novel platform, we will accelerate the timeline for evaluating a vaccine in the clinic. The scope
of this work will span knowledge transfer to the selected CDMO through successful IND filing for the final
vaccine candidate. A technical CDMO management team, including CDMO project leaders and Haynes,
Weissman, Maughan and Denny will be assembled to oversee the process and ensure successful delivery of
the program. The following specific aims are proposed for the project.
 • Aim 1. Transfer pre-production knowledge and processes for mRNA immunogens to contract
 development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs).
 • Aim 2. Deliver final drug substances and drug products for toxicology studies and clinical testing.
 • Aim 3. Develop and deliver regulatory strategies to enable Phase I proof of concept clinical
studies."
10747900,"An important question in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS) is whether myelin/axonal damage in the white matter facilitates
neuronal cell body loss in the gray matter, or results from two independent processes. Neurodegeneration underlies
progressive decline in MS for which there is no remedy, highlighting the significance of elucidating its mechanisms. To
address this question, we utilized the visual system, where all myelinated axons in the optic nerve arise from retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs). In patients with MS, RGC loss and retinal thinning correlate with whole-brain and gray matter atrophy.
Therefore, visual assessments may be a sensitive biomarker for neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the visual system is being
used to determine the efficacy of new clinical trial drugs to treat MS. Preliminary data presented in this proposal
demonstrate that blocking AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) signaling in mature oligodendrocytes (OLs)
prevents axonal damage in the optic nerve and inhibits retinal ganglion cell loss in experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Glutamate dysregulation is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), but whether excitotoxic
mechanisms specific to OLs contribute to myelin degradation and impact axonal injury has not been explored. Elevated
levels of glutamate are detected prior to the appearance of new T2-visible white matter lesions implicating glutamate as an
important excitotoxin in patients with MS. We previously reported that MOG-reactive T cells provoke microglia to release
glutamate from the system xc- transporter, promoting myelin degradation during autoimmune demyelination. Here, we show
that selective deletion of AMPAR function on mature OLs diminished the clinical symptoms of EAE, attenuated myelin
and axonal loss in the optic nerve, and inhibited RGC loss. Therefore, we hypothesize that reducing AMPAR-signaling
in OLs prevents demyelination and/or promotes remyelination, resulting in preservation of the underlying axon and
its neuronal soma. These studies will utilize inducible OL-specific deletion of AMPARs in chronic and relapsing-remitting
autoimmune inflammatory (EAE) to explore the impact on axon integrity and ultimately RGC health. Effects of deleting
AMPARs on ionotropic glutamate receptor function will be determined by Ca2+ imaging and mechanisms of cell death as
well as changes in proliferation and differentiation that may promote remyelination. Axon viability will be assessed by
confocal 3D reconstruction, electron microscopy, and mitochondrial trafficking and morphology using transgenic mice that
express fluorescent mitochondria. Changes in OL number and maturation state will be tracked with the genetic fluorescent
reporter tdTomato, to determine the fate of newly proliferated OL progenitor cells separately from pre-existing myelin.
Furthermore, pathological assessments of the retina will be evaluated in light of longitudinal functional visual assessments
(visual evoked potentials and electroretinograms) and longitudinal structural visual imaging (optical coherence tomography)
to investigate how inducible deletion of AMPAR function in OLs modulates retinal function at key time points in
demyelinating diseases."
10747375,"Project Summary: There is a rapidly growing body of evidence that Müller glia can are a source of retinal
progenitors to promote neural regeneration. Many studies have demonstrated that Müller glia can become
proliferating progenitor cells in the retinas of different vertebrate species. Most reports have studied Müller
glia-derived progenitors in acutely damaged retinas. However, little is known about the mechanisms that
stimulate neurogenesis from Müller glia-derived progenitors in undamaged retinas or retinas undergoing slow,
progressive degeneration. Furthermore, the regeneration of retinal neurons in warm-blooded vertebrates is
limited compared to that seen in cold-blooded vertebrates. Therefore, the identification of the secreted factors
and signaling pathways that block or stimulate neural regeneration from Müller glia-derived progenitors is
crucially important to developing new therapies to treat degenerative diseases of the human retina. We have
obtained compelling novel preliminary data indicating that Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) and
endocannabinoids impact the de-differentation and reprogramming of Müller glia into proliferating, neurogenic
retinal progenitors in chicks and mice. We will investigate how the phenotype and plasticity of the Müller glia
are regulated by FABPs and endocannabinoids in normal, damaged and growth factor-treated retinas. We will
use a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to selectively activate or inhibit FABPs and
endocannabinoid-signaling. We will compare and contrast how FABPs and endocannabinoid-signaling impacts
the formation of Müller glia-derived progenitors in chick and rodent model systems with different inherent
capacities for retinal regeneration. We expect that the completion of the experiments described in this
proposal will provide significant new information regarding how mature Müller glia can be reprogrammed into
Müller glia-derived progenitors that regenerate retinal neurons. Identification and understanding of the
mechanisms that enhance the neurogenic potential of Müller glia is required to develop new therapies for sight-
threatening diseases, such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration that involve the loss of
retinal neurons."

Candidate: The candidate, Katy Liu, is an MD/PhD glaucoma fellowship-trained, board-eligible
ophthalmologist with a career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist. She has a PhD in Cell &
Molecular Physiology, and her long-term objective is to better understand the pathobiology of the conventional
outflow tract in order to improve treatments and outcomes in patients with glaucoma. Dr. Liu is completing a
glaucoma research fellowship and will be promoted to faculty at the Duke Eye Center in July 2020.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Liu proposes to investigate the role of tissue resident macrophages in
conventional outflow homeostasis, which directly impacts the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). The
proposed K08 will allow Dr. Liu to expand upon her current scientific knowledge and skills by gaining
experience in ocular immunology, aqueous outflow physiology, genetic mouse models, flow cytometry and
single-cell RNA sequencing. Dr. Liu will obtain formal didactics in ocular immunology, mouse genetics,
biostatistics and responsible conduct of research. She will attend individual meetings with co-mentors to
discuss career development, departmental seminars and faculty development workshops. Dr. Liu will regularly
attend national meetings to discuss and present ongoing research, and submit her work for publication.
Environment: The mentorship team consists of renowned experts in conventional outflow physiology and
ocular immunology who are ideal to advise the candidate on her research. The Duke Eye Center is ideal for Dr.
Liu with specific strengths in its Glaucoma research program and the Center for Ocular Immunology. She will
also benefit from the world-class research and clinical faculty at the Duke Eye Center. Finally, the mentorship
team and institution are fully committed to prepare Dr. Liu for independence as an R01-funded scientist.
Research: Although immune regulators such as TGF-beta, corticosteroids and prostaglandin analogues are
known to alter conventional outflow function, the role of the native immune system in conventional outflow
homeostasis is poorly understood. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that tissue resident
macrophages function in IOP regulation by altering extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis in the conventional
outflow tract. In Aim 1, macrophages in the outflow tract will be characterized by lineage tracing and their
functional effect measured by IOP and outflow facility following pharmacologic depletion or genetic deletion of
macrophages. Aim 2 will assess changes to the ECM of the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork, the region
of greatest outflow resistance generation in the conventional outflow tract, with macrophage deletion by
measuring biomechanical stiffness and analyzing ECM components. Aim 2 will also reveal the TM
macrophage-specific transcriptome which we will correlate with its functional role in the conventional outflow
tract. This project will provide a better understanding of macrophage function in IOP homeostasis, which will
influence future therapeutic strategies for glaucoma and serve as the foundation for a future R01 grant."

Recently-described SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-NDD) is caused by pathogenic
variants in the gene SCN3A, which encodes the sodium (Na+) channel subunit Nav1.3. SCN3A-NDD is a
devastating condition defined by treatment-resistant epilepsy and severe/profound intellectual disability (ID);
surprisingly, many patients also exhibit malformation of cortical development (MCD), a developmental
disturbance in the structural formation of the cerebral cortex of the brain, suggesting functional roles for Nav1.3
during embryological development. How genetic variants in SCN3A leads to epilepsy and neurodevelopmental
disability, and how SCN3A variants lead to MCD, is unknown. Research is required to clarify the functional role
of Nav1.3 during early brain development and to progress towards novel therapies or preventative measures
for SCN3A-NDD, which is currently and untreatable disorder.
This 5-year collaborative application employs novel tools and innovative neuroscience approaches to test the
hypothesis that pathogenic variants in SCN3A lead to a disorder that includes epilepsy and MCD via
dysregulated Na+ currents in migrating neurons of the developing cerebral cortex.
Electrophysiological recordings in heterologous cell systems indicate that pathogenic SCN3A variants found in
patients with SCN3A-NDD largely produce Na+ channels that exhibit gain of function due to increased
persistent current and alterations in the voltage dependence of channel activation, which increase channel
activity. However, the mechanistic basis of observed variability in epilepsy severity and presence or absence of
MCD, is unclear. And how altered channel activity impacts the function of neurons has not been investigated.
Proposed experiments will determine the relationship between specific SCN3A variants and correlated clinical
phenotype (epilepsy, MCD, severity of ID) in a large cohort of human patients with SCN3A-NDD. To link
SCN3A variants to dysfunction of ion channels and neurons, we will compare the biophysical properties of
normal Na+ channels to channels containing variant Nav1.3; test cell-intrinsic effects of SCN3A variants in
neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from human SCN3A-NDD patients; and test effects of
variant overexpression via in utero electroporation of mouse embryo followed by electrical recording in brain
slices (Aim 1). The impact of variant SCN3A on the morphology of immature neurons and cytoarchitecture of
the developing cerebral cortex will inform the role of SCN3A in development (Aim 2). To translate these
findings towards clinical applications, we will attempt to ameliorate features of SCN3A-NND in advanced model
systems, including a newly generated conditional point mutant mouse, via targeted manipulation of pathogenic
Nav1.3-mediated Na+ current (Aim 3).
Results will provide novel information on the role of Nav1.3 during brain development, and will define the
pathogenic mechanisms of SCN3A-NDD towards development of novel, targeted therapies in human patients."

 Schistosomiasis is a major tropical parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus
Schistosoma. The etiopathology of schistosomiasis results from an inflammatory response to the tissue-trapped
parasite eggs. Morbidity and mortality in infection with Schistosoma mansoni are due to a pathogenic CD4 T cell-
mediated immune response against egg components, which results in granuloma formation and fibrosis in the liver
and intestines. The spectrum of pathology ranges from mild gastrointestinal symptoms in most cases to severe
hepatosplenomegaly, hemorrhage and death in a minority of patients. This variation also exists in mouse model of
schistosomiasis where CBA mice develop severe egg induced immunopathology driven by IL-17-producing T cells
(Th17 cells); while C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice develop milder lesions driven by Th2 cells.
 We propose to investigate a novel immune mechanism that protects the host from developing severe
immunopathology. This is based on our observation that in BL/6 mice, the mild pathology is associated with a
protective type I Interferon (IFN) response that is dependent on STING, an adaptor molecule that functions to detect
the presence of cytosolic egg-derived DNA. Indeed, BL/6 mice deficient in STING, develop significantly larger
hepatic lesions. The inhibitory effect of STING is via targeting CD209a, a C-type lectin receptor on APCs, which we
recently reported to be associated with severe pathology. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesize that
STING related pathways promote the development of antigen presenting cell (APC)s that contribute to reduced
inflammation.
 Specific Aim 1 of the proposal is to define the role of the cGAS/STING pathway in suppressing egg-induced
immunopathology. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate how STING modulates CD209a expression.
 The proposed experiments represent a concerted effort to unravel novel innate immune mechanisms
affording host protection in schistosomiasis, a heretofore unexplored area of research in this disease and other
Th17 driven inflammatory diseases."

Acute brain injuries resulting from cerebrovascular injury or trauma, such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or
traumatic brain injury, are major medical problems that cause considerable mortality and morbidity in older
Americans. Secondary neuroinflammatory events after ICH can further damage the brain and lead to increased
risk of neurologic complications including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Despite significant
advances in the medical management of these patients, there is a clear and urgent need for interventions that
improve neurologic recovery and outcomes. To address this unmet need, the clinical candidate, MW189, is a
CNS-penetrant, small molecule that selectively attenuates injury- and disease-induced proinflammatory
cytokine overproduction. Proinflammatory cytokine overproduction from abnormally activated glia contributes to
cerebral edema, long-term neurological damage, and cognitive deficits following acute brain injuries. This
mechanistic linkage of the acute cytokine surge to progression of injury, plus the attractive therapeutic time
window of hours to days post-insult, provide a rational therapeutic target for intervention in the acute care
setting. The Biomarker and Edema Attenuation in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage (BEACH) trial is a first-in-patient
phase 2a, proof-of-concept study of MW189 in patients with ICH. The study aims are to: (1) Prepare, recruit,
and conduct the phase 2a clinical study of MW189, and (2) Evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
inflammatory biomarkers, and clinical outcomes. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind
controlled trial will enroll 120 non-traumatic ICH participants, with an anticipated average age in their mid-60s
and substantial numbers of individuals with cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Patients will be randomized to MW189 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with the first dose initiated within 24 hours of
symptoms, then dosing every 12 hours for 5 days (or until discharge, whichever is first). Safety and tolerability
of MW189 compared to placebo, and PK profiles of MW189 will be determined. Exploratory outcomes will
include radiographic and clinical endpoints and measurement of plasma levels of brain-derived inflammatory
and neuronal injury biomarkers to demonstrate engagement of pharmacological mechanism. Success with
MW189 in ICH patients will further de-risk the compound for subsequent larger trials of acute CNS injury
and/or to develop the drug for AD and other age-related dementias. The study will also generate important
information about the utility of targeting the acute proinflammatory cytokine aspects of neuroinflammation in
older Americans with vascular disease."

Human gut microbiota, with its massive catalytical capacity and functional potential, may act as an “endocrine
organ” and significantly contribute to metabolic health. Indeed, basic microbiological research and culture-
based human studies have elucidated multiple pathways through which human gut microbiota may modulate
the risk of developing metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Existing human studies also
demonstrated promising evidence supporting a link between microbiome and prevalent diabetes, although few
longitudinal studies have been conducted to establish a prospective relationship between microbiome and the
risk of developing T2D. This proposal represents major research efforts to significantly accelerate the
advances in the research of microbiome and T2D risk by examining prospective relationships between gut
microbial composition, functional potential, and fecal metabolome that operate in candidate pathways and T2D
risk. We will also use network analysis and other advanced methods to interrogate the overall metagenomic,
metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic profiles in fecal samples for the identification of novel microbial features
(i.e., microbes, their functional potential, gene transcription levels, and microbiota metabolites) and pathways
that might be involved in the development of T2D. As a secondary aim, we will evaluate the interplay between
diet and microbiome on fecal metabolome and T2D risk. Furthermore, these complementary, inter-connected
study aims will be realized by an experienced investigator team consisting of researchers with expertise in
microbiome, metabolomics, biomarker research, diabetes epidemiology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. To
facilitate better generalizability and internal validity of research findings, we will examine these novel
associations in two US cohorts with complementary ethnic and socioeconomic profiles: Nurses’ Health Study II
and Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos. Rich resources of these two cohorts, including fecal
samples, repeated assessments of diet, lifestyle, medical history, and use of medications, longitudinal follow-
up on diabetes status, and infrastructure for sample preparation/storage and computing, will empower the
investigators to accomplish the proposed aims cost-effectively. To strengthen between-institution collaboration
and ensure a successful implementation of the proposed research, Drs. Qi Sun (at Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health) and Qibin Qi (at Albert Einstein College of Medicine) will share the responsibility of
overseeing the overall conduct of research through the Multiple PI mechanism. In summary, this project will
elucidate prospective associations of gut microbiome and fecal metabolome with T2D risk and facilitate
discoveries of novel microbial features relevant to T2D risk. As such, the proposed research has a great
potential to identify novel microbiota-related risk or beneficial factors for developing more targeted and
individualized strategies for the prevention and management of diabetes."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly, but current treatments
target advanced stages when interventions may be limited by irreversible cell loss. Soft drusen are the initial and
hallmark feature of AMD, but their pathogenesis is unclear and the development of treatments is limited by the
lack of good animal models. Unlike most laboratory animals, nonhuman primates (NHPs) possess a true macula
and spontaneously develop soft drusen resembling early human AMD. Prior studies of NHP drusen have been
observational, cross-sectional, and qualitative, owing to the high costs of maintaining aged animals, limited
longitudinal imaging capabilities, and lack of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics support.
We recently surveyed a unique colony of geriatric rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research
Center (CNPRC), and found a 30.6% prevalence of drusen. Using high-resolution multimodal in vivo imaging,
we precisely measured drusen progression over 2 years, with histological and ultrastructural correlates
demonstrating lipid accumulation resembling human soft drusen. Similar to cardiovascular diseases, AMD share
epidemiologic risk factors such as high fat diets, susceptibility genes in lipid metabolism, and deposits similar to
atherosclerotic plaques with lipoprotein accumulation, lipid oxidation, and complement-based inflammatory
responses. Recent pilot studies suggest that high-dose oral atorvastatin can cause drusen regression in some
AMD patients, but human studies are limited by the heterogeneity of AMD phenotypes and variability in subject
diets and serum lipid concentrations.
In this study, we plan to establish a new, unique cohort of aged rhesus macaques with soft drusen, and perform
1) detailed ophthalmic characterization using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to
precisely measure retinal layers and track drusen volume, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to measure RPE
lipofuscin, 2) metabolic profiling to measure fasting plasma metabolites, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, and
3) whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants in animals with drusen that may be shared with human
AMD. Next, we will establish the impact of a “Western-style” high-fat/sugar (HFS) diet and high-dose atorvastatin
on drusen progression and RPE health over 2 years, and determine possible correlations with dietary fats and
serum lipids. Finally, we will employ NGS-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to determine the
gene expression profile in macular RPE cells with and without soft drusen, exposure to HFS diet, or treatment
with high-dose statin, followed by immunohistochemistry of contralateral eyes to evaluate and validate identified
gene sets or pathways, as well as complement and other immune pathways. Together, these studies will not
only establish a highly-valuable and unique cohort of aged rhesus macaques with soft drusen suitable for
translational studies, but also explore the role of dietary lipids, oral statins, RPE gene expression, and immune
pathways in this NHP model of early AMD."

work on developing a better understanding of how human malformations occur and their underlying
mechanisms of morphogenesis. The workshops are held annually in celebration of the career of David W.
Smith who was the father of human clinical dysmorphology and first to initiate these meetings. Meetings are
held over 4-5 days in the summer and have an attendance of 120-140 individuals who are selected following
submission of abstracts reviewed by the scientific program committee. Attendance is predicated on having an
abstract accepted for presentation. The workshop is intended to be an interactive exchange and thus is limited
only to those presenting that year. Each year three to five central topics are selected by the organizers. The
selection of topics takes into account when the topic had last been a focus, and the timeliness of the topic
based on new scientific developments and emerging fields. The meetings consist of a workshop format in
which short presentations of hypothesis driven findings are then followed by an intense discussion period.
There are also typically 3-4 plenary sessions presented by internationally recognized experts in the field.
These presentations cover broad topics related to the central topics chosen for the workshop. The meetings

Evolutionary forces have important consequences for human diseases of development, social behavior,
and metabolism along with the progression of cancers and susceptibility to pathogens. These forces
largely determine the types of genetic changes and genes that influence or underlie these traits. The
goal of the McGrath lab is to understand the genetic basis of adaptation. What are the genetic changes
that can increase fitness and how do they modify cellular activity and phenotypic change to accomplish
this? Experimental evolution using the model organism C. elegans is a powerful approach to address
these questions. C. elegans, a genetically-tractable, short-lived nematode, can be used to study the
evolution of development, behavior, and sexual reproduction. In the next five years, the McGrath lab
will identify continue to identify the genetic, cellular, and phenotypic basis of adaptation, focusing on
three main areas. First, the genetic and cellular basis of pheromone-dependent trait evolution will be
characterized. C. elegans release and sense dozens of acaroside pheromones that modify a large
number of behavioral and developmental traits. This work will provide a model for understanding how

evolution of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex will be characterized in a number of nematode
species. Chromatin state regulates gene expression; it is important for determining cell fate and
phenotypic plasticity. Genetic mutations in chromatin remodelers are an important risk factor for many
cancers. Finally, genes and neurons responsible for differences in food consumption will be identified.
Obesity is a common risk factor in Americans. Fundamental work in C. elegans could help us design

 There is substantial ethnic and racial inequity in the burden of social adversities across life span, and
disparities in several adult chronic diseases can be traced to social inequalities experienced in childhood.
Social adversities such as poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and
parental incarceration are particularly pervasive in inner-city, African American (AA) populations; and can have
substantial impact on biological processes that put them at risk for chronic stress disorders (e.g. posttraumatic
stress disorder, PTSD) and metabolic diseases. Previously, we observed that olfactory bulb (OB) volumes
were substantially reduced in AA adults who developed PTSD following severe childhood adversities,
compared to those with similar exposures who did not develop PTSD, which is congruent with animal studies
showing that maternal deprivation reduced OB size. Yet how these social exposures become translated into
chronic health disorders, is unclear. Epigenetic factors (i.e. modifications to the genome that are not changes
in nucleotide sequence) have been posited to play critical roles in mediating the impact of environmental
exposures on health, due to their influence on developmental plasticity and long-term functional biology.
 Our proposed study builds upon our R21 study in inner-city AA populations which revealed that Growth
Arrest Specific 5 (GAS5), a non-coding RNA (lncRNA) likely plays an epigenetic role as a decoy, diverting
glucocorticoids from binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of genes that
respond to glucocorticoids and preventing downstream molecular and physiological effects. African Americans
with elevated GAS5 levels, had larger OB volumes, lower afternoon cortisol levels and lower sympathetic
arousal independent of burden of neighborhood disorder and perceived social stress and racial discrimination.
However, our studies also revealed that social connectedness and Daily Spiritual Experience Scale also
moderated a broad spectrum of stress responsive behaviors (e.g. perceived stress, affect, sleep disruptions,
risk taking, and resilience), thereby providing a strong justification to investigate genome-wide epigenomic
mechanisms of response to social adversities. As a result, we propose a 5-year prospective study involving
genome-wide noncoding RNA profiling of 300 AA with dimensional differences in childhood social adversities.
Our Specific Aims are: (1) conduct baseline microRNA (miRNA), lncRNA and mRNA profiling in olfactory
neurons (ON) of AA cohorts to examine associations between noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and childhood social
adversities; (2) quantify baseline associations between ncRNA levels, perceived social stress and racial
discrimination, social connectedness, spiritual experience scale, and both behavioral and neurophysiologic
measures of stress; and (3) investigate mediational roles of ncRNA on the predictive influences of cumulative
exposures to neighborhood stress, poverty, social stress, perceived discrimination and other social
disadvantages on 12-month trajectory in stress response behaviors. Our overarching hypothesis is that
interactions between miRNA and lncRNA will partially mediate effects of these adverse social contexts (e.g.
poverty, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes
related to stress response ( e.g. GR signaling, immune signaling, circadian molecular alterations, and elevated
sympathetic tone) and stress responsive behaviors (perceived stress, psychiatric, sleep disruptions, risk taking,
and resilience). This project is innovative in using non-invasively derived ON to investigate intraneuronal
epigenetic mechanisms in a prospective design, and in use of microscopy to explore intraneuronal interactions
between glucocorticoids, GR, miRNA and lncRNA at nano-resolution. Results of this study will provide
evidence for the role that ncRNA play in mediating the effects social adversities on chronic diseases, highlight
epigenomic signature of resilience and produce epigenomic hotspots for treatment intervention."

  In the United States, HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect adolescents and 
young adults (AYA). Youth aged 13-­24 years comprise ~21% of incident HIV cases. In addition, 2017 data 
demonstrated the fourth consecutive year of increasing STI rates, with the highest incidence occurring in AYA. 
Amidst these public health challenges, the 2018 licensure of tenofovir-­emtricitabine as HIV pre-­exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) for adolescents presents a key opportunity for enhancing youth HIV and STI prevention 
services. Currently, <2% of U.S. PrEP prescriptions are for adolescents <18 years of age. Pediatric primary care 
providers (PCPs) are thus well-­positioned to expand PrEP delivery. However, sexual health service delivery in 
primary care is hampered by PCP time constraints and competing demands. There is a critical need for both 
behavioral interventions to increase PrEP uptake and reduce STIs in adolescents, and implementation strategies 
to disseminate PrEP and enhanced sexual health services in adolescent primary care. The goal of this K23 
application is to facilitate Dr. Sarah M. Wood’s long-­term goal of becoming an independent investigator in 
adolescent HIV and STI prevention through an integrated program of training and applied research that will 
prepare her to meet the challenges of the current HIV and STI epidemics. This award will also focus on her 
short-­term goal of gaining the methodologic expertise needed to adapt, optimize for implementation, and 
test, a developmentally-­tailored, PrEP-­inclusive, HIV/STI prevention health coaching intervention for 
adolescents in primary care. The training objectives focus on content areas where she currently lacks the 
methodologic expertise to carry out this goal: 1) bio-­behavioral intervention adaptation, 2) implementation 
science, and 3) clinical trial methodology. This training plan will be bolstered by a highly skilled mentorship team 
with expertise in intervention development, adolescent sexual health and qualitative methodology, and primary 
care pragmatic clinical trials. The advisory team will provide further expertise in developmental tailoring, 
prevention science, implementation science, mental health measurement and targets, and clinical trial design 
and analysis. Dr. Wood’s training objectives will progress in parallel with, and inform, her applied research aims. 
Aim 1 will use qualitative methods and the ADAPT-­ITT framework to adapt the health coaching intervention. Aim 
2 will determine acceptability and feasibility of the intervention among primary care providers, and develop an 
optimized primary care implementation strategy for the intervention. Finally, Aim 3 will conduct a small 
randomized controlled trial to test the intervention for change in prevention self-­efficacy, as well as acceptability 
and feasibility and in adolescents with a history of STI. The culmination of Dr. Wood’s research and training will 
be the submission of a R01 application for a type I hybrid randomized effectiveness-­implementation trial of the 
health coaching intervention."
10761768,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project supports the career development of Dr. Katherene Anguah in her path to become an
independent translational researcher focusing on how dietary components may benefit cardiometabolic
health through the control of appetite. The mentored plan builds on previous training by providing additional
technical, academic, and professional development skills to facilitate research independence. An
interdisciplinary team of mentors includes experts in human clinical feeding studies, functional magnetic
resonance imaging, microbiome analysis, and stable isotope labeled, targeted metabolomics. The 5-year
plan includes the opportunity to advance through both didactic instruction and experiences aimed at
expanding skills in research management and scientific writing. Rationale: Strong evidence supports the
association between high fiber (HiFi) diets (e.g. legumes, nuts, vegetables) and a reduced risk for chronic
conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. However, the
current U.S. average consumption of dietary fiber of 17g/day is significantly below the recommendation
level of 25g/d for women and 38g/d for men. Furthermore, fiber fermentation to produce short chain fatty
acid (SCFA) products and alterations in microbial composition and activity may be mechanisms linking a
HiFi diet to improved health. Importantly, much of the data, including findings supporting a beneficial role of
SCFA have been derived from animal studies. Human studies are now needed to advance the
understanding of the translational significance of rodent studies and the potential benefit of fiber on
microbial metabolites and cardiometabolic health, glucose regulation, appetite and satiety. The central
hypothesis is that that the mechanisms by which dietary fiber provides metabolic benefit include direct
physical effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract to slow nutrient absorption, and indirect effects to reduce
food intake mediated by SCFA-induced secretion of intestinal hormones resulting in increased satiety.
Design: Using fiber derived from peas, Aim 1 will test the effect of a HiFi diet on appetite, satiety, and
cardiometabolic health and whether elevated SCFA concentration mediates improved satiety. Aim 2 will
quantitate the changes in microbial composition and colonic SCFA production rate during HiFi feeding and
whether any changes are potential mediators of observed benefits on satiety and cardiometabolic risk
factors. Relevance: These studies will significantly expand the understanding of mechanisms by which
dietary fiber improves satiety and cardiometabolic health in humans."
10768648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Symptom burden continues to be a significant problem for millions of adults living with heart failure (HF), the
fastest growing cardiovascular condition in the U.S. Symptoms, which often co-occur or cluster together, are of
utmost importance in HF because they predict quality of life and clinical events. There is considerable
heterogeneity in symptoms in HF, however, that is particularly evident in the vulnerable transition period after a
hospitalization for acute decompensated HF. While symptoms improve for some patients and they have longer
periods of relative stability, others are plagued by enduring symptoms leading to poor outcomes, including
rehospitalization. Given little-to-no association between hemodynamic markers (e.g. ejection fraction) and
symptoms in HF, our clinical efforts to optimize hemodynamic stability during a hospitalization may not
translate to improvement in symptoms post-hospitalization. Many studies have shown that HF is not just a
hemodynamic, “pump failure” problem, but that it is a multifactorial, systemic condition involving processes
such as inflammation, sympathetic dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction. Based on research by our group
and others, we propose that a multi-biomarker panel and the physical frailty phenotype that capture the
multifaceted nature of HF might tell us more about symptoms in HF than our current objective markers.
Therefore, the purpose of the proposed research is to 1) identify clusters of change in symptoms after a HF
hospitalization and 2) quantify longitudinal associations between symptoms, biomarkers, and physical frailty.
We will address the following aims through a gender- and age-balanced longitudinal study of 240 adults during
the 6 month transition period after a hospitalization for acute decompensated HF: 1) identify clusters of change
in physical symptoms among adults with heart failure, 2) quantify longitudinal associations between biomarkers
and physical symptoms among adults with heart failure, and 3) quantify longitudinal associations between
physical frailty and physical symptoms among adults with heart failure. We will use advanced quantitative
modeling, including growth mixture modeling and longitudinal mediation modeling, to examine changes in
symptoms, biomarkers, and physical frailty post-HF hospitalization and associations therein. This innovative
study will advance HF symptom science by utilizing a multi-biomarker panel and the physical frailty phenotype
that capture the multifaceted nature of HF, coupled with advanced quantitative modeling, to characterize
heterogeneity and identify potential mechanisms of symptoms in HF. As a result, this research will inform the
next phase of this program of research by pinpointing amenable targets for intervention to provide better,
individualized treatment to improve symptom burden in HF."

Down syndrome (DS) is caused by human chromosome 21 trisomy (hsa21) and is the most
common genetic form of intellectual and cognitive disability, occurring in ~1 in 700 live births. DS
patients also exhibit age-related progressive cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and the
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology by 40-50 years of age. There are
currently no drugs that are approved specifically for DS to prevent cognitive decline, representing
a clear and urgent unmet medical need. The progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration
in DS is strongly linked to the overexpression of Dyrk1a (dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-
phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A), which is overexpressed on hsa21 in all DS patients. Mouse
models of DS that include Dyrk1a overexpression exhibit profound cognitive deficits in
hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and motor function associated with AD-like
neuropathology. Notably, normalizing the gene dosage of DYRK1A through a genetic method in
the Ts65Dn model of DS was sufficient to reverse several neuroanatomical AD phenotypes, and
a nonselective small molecule inhibitor of Dyrk1a (CX-4945) was able to reverse
neurodegenerative phenotypes in Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice. These data indicate that Dyrk1a
overexpression is a key factor in the progressive cognitive decline exhibited by DS patients and
is an attractive therapeutic target.
Iluminos Therapeutics, LLC, (Iluminos) co-founders Dr. Travis Dunckley and Dr. Christopher
Hulme have carried out a sustained medicinal chemistry effort (Hulme) and validation strategy
(Dunckley) to develop and validate selective and efficacious Dyrk1a inhibitors. Herein we propose
in Phase I to confirm the efficacy of our lead molecule, Dyr533, in a mouse model of DS. In Phase
II we propose IND enabling studies to advance the commercialization efforts of this therapeutic
approach. Successful completion of these Phases of the proposed STTR will significantly
advance the commercial prospects for Iluminos’ Dyrk1a strategy and may ultimately lead to the
availability of a much needed therapeutic option for DS patients following clinical trials in
subsequent years."
10759376,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex, multifactorial disease. I have recently
reported subretinal Müller cell membranes in areas of geographic atrophy (GA). These membranes
closely mimic areas of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and choriocapillaris loss. I have also
observed Müller cells anterior to drusen expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and appearing
to migrate to the ONL in eyes with AMD. These data indicate Müller cell activation and remodeling in
AMD. The stimuli for and consequences of these changes, however, are not understood. We
hypothesize that changes to the subretinal milieu in non-neovascular AMD stimulate Müller cell
activation and remodeling that exacerbates AMD pathology.
 The first Aim of this proposal will investigate how Müller cells are affected by subretinal changes that
occur in AMD. We will investigate Müller cell morphological and metabolic changes anterior to drusen in
human donor eyes with AMD. We will then evaluate the Müller cell response to drusen components,
amyloid beta and oxidized lipids, in vitro. The second subAim of Aim 1 will determine the effect that
RPE cells exert on Müller cells. While these cells are normally separated by the photoreceptor
segments, subretinal pathology as well as their abnormal migration and extension allows them to touch
in eyes with AMD. We will analyze the RPE influence on Müller cells using human AMD tissue and cell
culture experiments.
 The second proposed Aim focuses on how Müller cells in the subretinal space affect neighboring
cells. We will first investigate how Müller cells affect RPE cells using cell culture experiments. We will
also investigate extracellular vesicle release by Müller cells and, if present, determine what effect these
have on RPE cells. We will also investigate the composition of the subretinal glial membranes that we
have observed in GA. Since it is not possible to determine in human retinas how early in the disease
process glia intrude the subretinal space, we have developed a rat model with focal RPE cell atrophy.
We will also determine whether these glial membranes form a scar which will prevent the flow of
material, including future stem cell therapy, from the retina to subretinal space. Finally, we will inhibit
the membrane and determine how this affects disease progression in our rat model of RPE atrophy.
 These studies will determine the role glia play in AMD pathology, potentially identifying novel
treatments. By investigating extracellular vesicle and exosome release from Müllers, our studies will
identify how Müller cells interact with other cell types in the normal and diseased retina."
10778539,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is responsible for ~10% of total cancer mortality worldwide. SCC prognosis is
context-dependent and does not seem to be determined by driver gene somatic mutations, which are similar
across different body sites and pathological grades. Our study of SCC arising in the rare genetic skin disease
Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) has identified genetic similarities between this deadly,
tissue damage-driven cancer, and a related cancer arising in the oral cavity, termed head and neck SCC
(HNSCC). Our unpublished research into HNSCC has demonstrated that this similarity extends beyond genetics
and has identified the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the tumor microenvironment as a
potential predictor of poor outcome. Our current proposal leverages the similarities between RDEB and certain
sub-types of HNSCC to explore initiation and progression events that are likely driven by different environmental
stimuli but which result in the same outcome; SCC with poor prognosis. In RDEB, ~90% of patients develop
cutaneous SCC by age 55 and 5-year survival is close to 0%. SCC in the skin of RDEB patients arise within
chronic wounds, an environment quite different to most head and neck cancers. Nevertheless, analysis of
mutations in these tumors suggests that similar mechanisms are driving tumor initiation, and analysis of gene
expression and ECM proteins suggests that similar mechanisms also drive tumor progression. We have
developed a novel assay of mutation in cultured keratinocytes which will determine the extent of existing mutation
in single cells isolated from peri-tumoral, normal-appearing tissue, a tissue region that is prone to cancer
development (a phenomenon known as ‘field cancerization’). Using this approach, we will also determine the
relationship between elements associated with risk factors in HNSCC, and mutagenesis driven by endogenous
deaminases of the AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) and APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) family, which have been shown to be active in all SCC genomes. To address the
role of ECM in progression of SCC, we will utilize a novel assay of tissue fibrosis that recapitulates the continual
collagen remodeling observed in SCC fibroblasts (in both RDEB and HNSCC) when compared with normal
fibroblasts isolated from the same patient which do not exhibit such collagen remodeling. We will interrogate the
role of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in driving tumor cell invasion through two separate but related mechanisms,
activation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling and regulation of ECM secretion. In parallel, we will
determine the timing of mutational processes resulting from tissue damage by assessing mutation acquisition in
APOBEC transgenic animals. Importantly, these studies will also enable us to evaluate APOBEC inhibition as
a potential preventative or treatment intervention for SCC in a pre-clinical setting. Together, our integrated in
vitro and in vivo studies will provide the rationale and platform to develop clinically relevant strategies for
improved SCC treatment and prevention."
10762956,"Chromatin condensation is a key feature in the terminal maturation of many hematopoietic cell types, but
is particularly critical in erythroblasts, which undergo rapid nuclear and chromatin condensation in preparation
for enucleation. The average human must generate ~2.5 million red blood cells per second to maintain steady
state and avoid anemia. The process of generating an enucleate red blood cell from a committed erythroid
progenitor is extremely complex, and requires significant in gene expression during a time of rapid cell division
and chromatin condensation. Defects in chromatin condensation are particularly common in inherited anemias
and myelodysplastic syndromes, however the specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate erythroid chromatin
condensation, and the relationship between chromatin condensation and gene expression are poorly
understood. The goal of this project is to delineate specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate, and coordinate,
changes in gene expression and chromatin structure during terminal erythroid maturation. During the last funding
period, we demonstrated that maturing erythroid cells accumulate mono-methylation of histone H4, lysine 20
(H4K20me1). We further demonstrated Setd8, the sole enzyme capable of generating this mark, is essential for
erythropoiesis. Disruption of Setd8, and subsequent loss of H4K20me1, resulted in a profound defect in
transcriptional repression and defects in chromatin condensation, both globally and at specific loci. The overall
goal of this proposal is to delineate mechanisms by which Setd8 and H4K20me1 regulate erythropoiesis.
Mass spectrometry studies demonstrated that accumulation of H4K20me1 in maturing erythroblasts was
accompanied by loss of histone H4 K16Ac, which interferes with the association of neighboring nucleosomes
and promotes histone decompaction, as well as loss of histone H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2), which
decreases the ability of histone H4 lysine 20 to interact with epigenetic readers. We hypothesize that this
epigenetic transition is an important determinate of gene expression and higher order chromatin structure in
maturing erythroblasts. In specific Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms that establish the H4 chromatin
landscape in maturing erythroblasts. H4K20me1 regulates chromatin structure and gene expression through
recruitment of epigenetic readers. The only H4K20me1 interacting protein expressed at significant levels in
erythroblasts is the Condensin II complex. We demonstrate that the Condensin II subunit NCAPH2 is essential
for erythropoiesis. Further, there is significant overlap in the transcriptomes of NCAPH2 / and SETD8 /
erythroblasts, supporting a model where Condensin II interacts with H4K20me1 to regulate gene expression
and chromatin structure during erythroid maturation. In specific aim 2, we will delineate the mechanisms by which
the Condensin II complex regulates terminal erythroid maturation. Together, these studies will provide novel
insights into the regulation of terminal erythroid maturation. As chromatin condensation is a common feature of
the terminal maturation of many cell types, these studies may have broad implications beyond erythropoiesis."
10791735,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Phase separation is an emerging organizing principle for intracellular biology. Processes that are now
understood to exploit phase separation include storage of genetic material, gene expression, ribosome
synthesis, signaling, stress response, and metabolism. While each phase-separating system has unique
features, there are universal themes relevant to all such systems, including regulation of the phase
boundary, the dynamics of mixing within and between condensates, and the interactions of condensates
with their surroundings. To uncover general principles regarding these common themes, we focus on a
well-suited model organism and system: the genetically tractable alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and
its pyrenoid, a non-membrane bound, phase-separated organelle responsible for efficient carbon fixation.
The pyrenoid offers many practical advantages: 1. its phase separation is driven by two well-
characterized components, the rigid enzyme complex Rubisco and the flexible linker protein EPYC1, via
a known specific binding interface; 2. the pyrenoid’s in vivo liquidity is reproduced in vitro with no energy
source; 3. in vivo assembly/disassembly is controllable by external cues; and 4. the pyrenoid is singular,
large, and stable enough to systematically investigate its functional interactions with other cellular
components. Based on these advantages, the pyrenoid has already proven to be a source of many
discoveries including the ability of a flexible multivalent linker to condense a rigid component, inheritance
of non-membrane bound organelles by fission, specific recruitment via a conserved binding motif, and a
magic-number effect. The key universal questions we will address with this system are: What is the role
of the valence, strength, and spacing of the interacting motifs in determining condensate properties? How
does the stability of small oligomers control phase boundaries? What keeps condensates in a liquid
state? How do cells control the number, size, and location of condensates, including their relation to other
cellular structures? Our approach will closely integrate theory and experiment, as providing fundamental
answers to these questions requires a multidisciplinary approach that places specific data within a broad
theoretical framework. We anticipate that our focus on underlying biophysical mechanisms will facilitate
generalizability of our results to a wide range of phase-separated intracellular systems."

The GEF-H1-IKKε-IRF5 signaling axis is an essential pathway for the recognition of
peptidoglycans and enables host defense responses to cope with intracellular pathogens such as
Listeria monocytogenes. Macrophages contain a reservoir of inactive GEF-H1 bound to
microtubules that is activated by dephosphorylation to form signaling platforms for the control of
innate and adaptive immunity. The GEF-H1 pathway is well positioned to allow the intracellular
detection of cell-invasive pathogens. As many pathogens have developed mechanisms for
intracellular survival and immune avoidance, the GEF-H1 pathway may have evolved to allow
critical immune detection of microbial effectors that target cytoskeletal components. However, it
is unclear how microbial effectors and pattern recognition receptors regulate microtubule
dynamics for the activation of GEF-H1. This application seeks support for studies designed to

10763031,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90) is essential for the folding and
activity of an array of `client' proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. They are
also responsible for many maladies including cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases. Hsp90 inhibition strategies are currently being explored in
these diseases in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, however the optimal use of
Hsp90-targeted therapeutics remains unknown. This is partly due to our limited
knowledge of Hsp90 regulation in cells. Unraveling the detailed regulatory mechanisms
of Hsp90 function in cells can provide new strategies to increase the cellular potency of
Hsp90 inhibitors. Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ATPase activity, which is
regulated by co-chaperones and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, it is
unclear how these regulatory components work together to fine tune Hsp90 function and
also contribute towards drug sensitivity. During the past five years we have made major
contributions towards the understanding of Hsp90 regulation by co-chaperones and
PTMs. i) New co-chaperones: We have identified three new co-chaperones, FNIP1, 2
(collectively FNIPs) and Tsc1, that decelerate the chaperone cycle and facilitate chaper-
oning of both kinase and non-kinase clients. They are regulated by PTMs (phosphoryla-
tion, O-GlcNAcylation, SUMOlyation and ubiquitination). Their expression also enhances
Hsp90 binding to drugs and consequently sensitizes cells to Hsp90 inhibitors. ii) Post-
translational modification of Hsp90: Our work during the past decade on Hsp90 PTMs
has redefined the regulation of its chaperone activity and revealed the reciprocal regula-
tory mechanisms between client proteins, co-chaperones, and Hsp90. We have recently
shown that loss of TSC1 co-chaperone leads to hypoacetylation of Hsp90 and elevated
its ATPase activity. It also subsequently decreased Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Our
long-term goal is to unravel the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 chaperone regulation in
cells and regulatory factors enhancing cellular potency of Hsp90 inhibitors. Our strategy
is to use biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays to decipher the interconnectivi-
ty and compensatory mechanisms between the co-chaperones and PTMs. Our vision is
to utilize this information to dissect the intricate network of regulatory signals involved in
fine tuning Hsp90 function and their impact towards cellular sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibi-
tors."
10760215,"The long-term goal of our research is to understand how the molecular and cellular functions of zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) modulate pathophysiologic responses of human pancreatic beta cells to inflammatory stress and autoimmune attack. ZnT8 is a tissue-specific zinc transporter with an exceedingly high expression level in the insulin-producing beta cells that dedicate ~50% of biosynthetic capacity to insulin production and secretion upon glucose stimulation. The primary function of ZnT8 is to maintain a high zinc concentration required for proper insulin folding and crystalline packing in the insulin secretory granules, but growing evidence suggests that ZnT8 is a dynamic protein with additional functional roles on the cell surface and at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where ZnT8 is a major client protein of unfolded protein response leading to ZnT8 ubiquitination, immunoproteasome degradation and antigenic presentation. In addition, ZnT8 is a major cell-surface autoantigen targeted by autoreactive B cell in the earlier phase of islet autoimmunity progression to overt type-1 diabetes. The pleiotropic roles of ZnT8 shape the unique biology of beta cells and modulate their susceptibility to disease-driving inflammatory stress. Accordingly, human ZnT8 is a major self-antigen targeted for autoimmune destruction of beta cells during acute islet inflammation, and also a major ER stress burden contributing to functional failure of beta cells under chronic, low-grade inflammation. At present, it is unclear how pathophysiologic responses of human ZnT8 may increase the cell vulnerability to inflammatory stress and autoimmune attack. The proposed research will elucidate the molecular details of cytokine-induced ZnT8 ubiquitination and degradation (Aim-1), and elucidate the processing and presentation of ZnT8 autoantigen on human beta cells (Aim-2). Uncovering the molecular mechanisms driving ZnT8 targeting, degradation, and antigenic presentation will inform how ER stress and ZnT8 immunogenicity may be regulated by inflammatory stress to increase the risk of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes."

Background. It is now evident that the majority of the mammalian genome has the potential to express non-
coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, the functionality and mechanism(s) of regulation of these ncRNAs are just
beginning to be explored. One challenge that biologists encounter is the detection of these ncRNAs, which
often tend to be transcriptionally tightly controlled and rapidly degraded. Using mouse models that allow easy
detection of lncRNA, we have recently identified a set of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) that are expressed
surrounding the immunoglobulin loci genes. These lncRNAs are placed inside topologically associating
domains (TADs) that are formed during B cell development. Experiments using mouse models that lack these
lncRNAs (published and preliminary data) demonstrate roles in class switch recombination and somatic
hypermutation mechanisms.
Objectives/Hypothesis. Here we investigate the direct role of lncRNAs in regulating genome local
architecture and DNA topology via cis and trans mechanisms. In aim 1: we evaluate the physiological role of
lncRNA-expressing loci in regulating IgH recombination via organizing TADIgH; in aim 2, we understand the
molecular mechanisms through which lncRNAs are used to control genome architecture; and in aim 3, we
focus on understanding the function of lncRNA SµGLT in control of CSR.
Study Design: Using mouse models and cell lines that are deficient in specific lncRNAs we aim to investigate
their immunologically relevant functions. For evaluating the molecular mechanism of action of the lncRNAs we
use biochemical assays to purify lncRNA interacting proteins and perform chromosomal architecture assays
such as HiC and 4C-seq. Finally, we perform high-throughput sequencing experiments to evaluate the
lncRNA's effect(s) on SHM in the Ig loci genes and elsewhere.
Disease Relevance: The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms in B cell
development and function. The lncRNAs being investigated in this application carry polymorphisms in patients
with IgA deficiency syndrome and thus our study is relevant for human physiology. Finally, antibody
diversification mechanisms are essential for immune system homeostasis but when these mechanisms fail
there are increased genomic alterations that are associated with lymphomas. Thus, this study is related with
both immunity and lymphomagenesis."

 Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) lead to more deaths each year in children than any other infectious
disease category. Despite this, the underlying microbial pathogens are rarely identified due to the limitations of
existing microbiologic tests, resulting in inappropriate antimicrobial use and other adverse outcomes. Viral-
bacterial co-infections and non-infectious inflammatory syndromes resembling LRTI, common in critically ill
patients, further complicate diagnosis. To address the need for improved respiratory diagnostics, we will leverage
an integrated host/microbe metagenomic next-generation sequencing (iHM-mNGS) approach, recently
developed by our group, that simultaneously profiles three central elements of LRTI: the pathogen, microbiome
and host response, from a single sample of respiratory fluid.
 We will accomplish our three aims by studying an established prospective, multicenter cohort of 455 critically
ill children with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Aim 1 will develop and test iHM-mNGS
classifiers designed to: a) accurately diagnose and differentiate LRTI from non-infectious acute respiratory
conditions, and b) rule-out bacterial LRTI with high certainty to permit judicious antimicrobial use. Aim 2 will
develop and test a mNGS model for detecting and differentiating LRTI pathogens from airway commensal
microbes, and then determine the capacity of the model to identify new, previously missed pathogens, in patients
with clinically adjudicated LRTI but negative standard clinical testing. Aim 3 will leverage CRISPR/Cas9 targeted
enrichment methods developed by our group to detect pathogen antimicrobial resistance genes, which could
more quickly inform appropriate antimicrobial therapy. We will develop and test a model to accurately predict
bacterial antimicrobial resistance without a need for culture, and then determine the utility of this approach as a
rapid diagnostic using real-time Nanopore sequencing.
 This study will address the need for better LRTI diagnostics by developing and testing advanced, culture-
independent methods that integrate host response and unbiased pathogen detection to achieve accurate LRTI
diagnosis and rule-out in a large multicenter cohort. Our methods aim to change the paradigm of pulmonary
diagnostics by simultaneously profiling host transcripts and microbial sequences from a single sample of
respiratory fluid."

Septins from all organisms including yeast and humans form rod-shaped heterooligomeric complexes that
are assembled into linear filaments and other higher-order structures such as rings and hourglasses. These
structures act as a cellular scaffold and/or diffusion barrier to impact diverse cellular functions including
cytokinesis, cell migration, ciliogenesis, dendritic spine morphogenesis, spermiogenesis, and bacterial
infection. Mutations in septin genes cause hereditary neuropathy and infertility in humans. Septins are also
implicated in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Thus,
understanding septin structure and function is critically important not only for basic science but also for public
health. However, it remains largely unknown how septins are assembled and dynamically remodeled into
various cellular architectures to perform distinct functions in any system.
Since the initial discovery of septins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this organism has
served as a highly effective model for uncovering the general principles of septin assembly and function. By
combining the power of yeast genetics and cell synchronization with cutting-edge imaging technologies
including platinum-replica electron microscopy and super-resolution light microscopy, we have determined
the architectures of the native septin structures in budding yeast. Septins form an “early hourglass” at the
division site that consists of paired septin filaments arranged in parallel to the mother-daughter axis. This
structure matures into a “zonal transitional hourglass” in anaphase, with a septin gauze at the outer zones
and myosin-II filaments in the mid-zone. The transitional hourglass is then remodeled into a “septin double
ring” that consists of circumferential paired and single filaments. The double ring now sandwiches a
constricting actomyosin ring. Both structures act together to restrict diffusible factors at the division site
during cytokinesis. Recent evidence suggests that septins also undergo architectural remodeling from an
hourglass-shaped structure during furrow ingression to a double ring-like structure during abscission in
mammalian cells. In this application, we will: (Aim 1) determine how septin high-order assembly and stability
at the division site is controlled by a LKB1-like kinase before cytokinesis in yeast; (Aim 2) determine how
septin architectural remodeling is controlled by a RhoGEF-anillin module during cytokinesis in yeast; and
(Aim 3) determine the septin architectures and their regulation by ArhGEF18 and anillin during furrow
ingression and abscission in mammalian cells. The proposed study is expected to significantly advance our
mechanistic understanding of septin assembly, remodeling, and function across model systems."
10738811,"Project Summary
 Signaling networks centered on the conserved protein kinases AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) enable cells to sense and respond appropriately to dynamic
fluctuations in a variety of systemic and local cues. Energetic stress activates AMPK to promote catabolic and
suppress anabolic pathways to balance energy supply and demand. AMPK also promotes glucose and lipid
homeostasis. In fact, the AMPK-activating drug metformin (aka, GlucoPhage) represents the most widely
prescribed treatment for type II diabetes. Curiously, AMPK paradoxically functions as a tumor suppressor or
tumor promoter depending on cellular context. Nutrients (i.e. amino acids) and growth factors (i.e. IGF/insulin)
cooperate to activate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which drives anabolic cell metabolism (i.e. protein and lipid
synthesis) and suppresses autophagy. Physiologically, aberrant mTORC1 signaling contributes to diverse
disorders including cancer and type II diabetes, and mTOR inhibitors are FDA-approved for renal cell carcinoma,
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and stent restenosis following angioplasty. Despite the physiologic and
therapeutic importance of AMPK and mTORC1, major gaps exist in our molecular-level understanding of these
cell signaling networks. In prior work we showed that phosphorylation of mTOR (on S1261) promotes mTORC1
signaling and cell growth/size. Unexpectedly, a kinome screen identified AMPK as an mTOR S1261 kinase.
Finding that AMPK phosphorylates mTOR on an mTORC1-activating site presented an apparent paradox,
however, as AMPK canonically inhibits mTORC1 in response to severe energetic stress. Our preliminary results
reconcile this paradoxical finding and expose a major gap in our understanding of AMPK and its relationship with
mTORC1. We find that after induction of nutrient stress, specifically amino acid starvation, amino acids provided
either by re-feeding or autophagy activate AMPK and increase mTOR S1261 phosphorylation, which re-activates
mTORC1 signaling and promotes cell survival in an AMPK dependent manner. Moreover, mTOR S1261
phosphorylation requires Rheb, an upstream mTORC1 activator under negative control by TSC. In this proposal
we investigate an unexpected role for AMPK and mTORC1 in cellular adaptation to nutrient stress. We
hypothesize that the AMPK-mTORC1 axis functions to maintain a survival level of metabolism during prolonged
nutrient stress or facilitates metabolic recovery when the stress subsides. This research, which employs cultured
cells and a CRISPR-engineered mouse model lacking mTOR S1261 phosphorylation, will provide conceptual
advance as it will shift how we think about AMPK in metabolic control and its relationship with mTORC1.
Elucidating paradoxical activation of mTORC1 by AMPK will advance our understanding of mTOR and AMPK in
health and disease and may identify new therapeutic strategies for treatment of linked disorders, such as cancer
and metabolic diseases."
10757002,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders, addiction, and mental
illness. These pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are prototypical members of the Cys-loop receptor
superfamily, which mediate fast neurotransmission throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Fundamental questions about nicotinic receptor biophysics and pharmacology remain, due in large part to the
limited high-resolution structural information. We propose to determine high-resolution structures of two
archetypal nicotinic receptor subtypes using single particle cryo-electron microscopy and investigate structure-
based mechanistic hypotheses using molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology. Our first target is
the muscle-type nicotinic receptor, the founding member of the pentameric receptor superfamily. Mutations in
the channel, as well as autoimmune antibodies to the receptor, cause myasthenic syndromes. Our second
target is the human α7 nicotinic receptor. α7 is exceptional among nicotinic receptors in several ways: it
assembles physiologically as a homopentamer, it is expressed abundantly in the brain but also in non-
electrically excitable cell types, it has a high permeability to Ca2+, and it desensitizes in microseconds. The
receptor is a target in neurodegenerative disease, addiction and inflammation. We propose to use single
particle cryo-electron microscopy combined with mutagenesis, electrophysiology and molecular dynamics
simulations to elucidate mechanisms of channel activation, ligand recognition and ion permeation in these two
distinctinctive nicotinic receptor subtypes to define general mechanisms and idiosyncratic properties."

 This application is designed to address the scientific goals of FOA-PA-19-112. Coronary microvascular
disease (CMD) is major sequelae of chest radiotherapy in cancer survivors. Blockade of the larger coronary
arteries can be treated by stents or surgical bypass; however, there are no effective therapies currently available
to target CMD. This project aims to investigate the novel and previously unexplored mechanisms of ionizing
radiation (IR)-induced coronary microvascular injury, and test the beneficial effects of a small molecule, N-acetyl-
ser-asp-lys-pro (Ac-SDKP), to counteract these effects. The scientific premise of this proposal is based on our
recent studies demonstrating profound endothelial cell injury with marked increase in coronary vascular
permeability, and fibrosis, after thoracic radiation exposure in rodents. We also found that radiation-induced CMD
was dose-dependently associated with the transcriptional inhibition of claudin-1 (cldn1) expression. Importantly,
administration of Ac-SDKP, a thymosin β4-derived endogenous peptide, normalized endothelial cell
permeability, reconstituted cldn1, and reduced cardiac fibrosis.
 Despite its cardioprotective potential, therapeutic application of Ac-SDKP has been challenging due to
its short half-life (T1/2 of 4.5 mins) in serum. Therefore, we have developed a stable, liposomal Ac-SDKP (Lip-
Ac-SDKP) formulation, which we intend to test for sustained systemic effects. We hypothesize that Ac-SDKP
mitigates radiation-induced coronary endothelial damage, and prevents microvascular leakage by
inhibiting IR-mediated cldn1 loss. In Aim I, we will examine the uptake efficiency and bioactivity of Lip-Ac-
SDKP in the heart and in coronary microvascular endothelial cells. In Aim II, we will examine the effects of Ac-
SDKP on endothelial barrier integrity after radiation and study the role of cldn1 in this process. In Aim III, we
will determine the effects of Ac-SDKP treatment on radiation-induced coronary blood flow and regional and
global cardiac function.
 We will accomplish these aims by using advanced molecular biology and imaging approaches. We have
developed a novel genetically engineered mouse model of endothelial cell-specific cldn1 gain-of-
function. We have also developed a cldn1 loss-of-function model using a next generation in vivo siRNA
delivery technology. Additionally, we will utilize tumor-bearing syngeneic and xenograft models to examine
Ac-SDKP effects after multi-dose thoracic irradiation. This project will provide mechanistic insight on the
protective effects of Ac-SDKP against radiation-induced CMD, and will have important therapeutic implications
for timely and targeted interventions in cancer patients susceptible to radiotherapy-induced CMD and cardiac
ischemia."
10754561,"Project Summary/Abstract
 A recent critical analysis of biologically active molecules and reactions most often used for their
preparation suggests that fraction of saturated carbons and presence of chiral centers correlate with
success as a compound moves from discovery, through clinical trials to an approved drug. About a
third of the compounds had at least one chiral center. In addition, practical aspects of manufacturing
still need to be addressed to market a cost effective drug. Thus discovery of fundamentally new
catalytic reactions, especially enantioselective ones, showing high turnover frequencies (i.e.,
substrate/ catalyst/unit time), that use readily available precursors, will have a significant impact on
medicinal and process chemistry. Through an approach that relies heavily on mechanistic insights
we strive to discover new enantioselective reactions of alkenes and alkynes. For example, use of
low-valent chiral (L*)cobalt complexes has enabled heterodimerization between a broad range of
1,3-dienes, and, ethylene and alkyl acrylates, which are feedstock materials. The products of these
reactions are synthetically valuable chiral 1,4-skipped dienes (produced in >90% yield and ee)
which can be turned into pharmaceutically relevant classes of compounds. Examples cited include
anti-microbial and anti-tumor and antifungal agents, GABA analogs, and metalloproteinase
inhibitors. On-going mechanistic studies strongly suggest the intermediacy of a cationic
{[P~P)Co(L)]+}X– species in these exceptionally selective C-C bond-forming reactions that proceed
under ambient conditions. Most remarkably, we recently (2018/2019) found that the chiral cationic
Co(I) complexes with custom-designed ligands catalyze enantioselective [2+2]-additions of alkynes
and vinyl-X derivatives, opening, arguably, the best route to enantiopure 3-substituted cyclobutenes,
potential precursors other valuable compounds. In sharp contrast to 1,3-dienes, 1,3-enynes form,
initially, vinylcyclobutenes and then, in a tandem fashion, highly functionalized cyclobutanes with an
all-carbon quaternary centers. Such reactions are highly efficient and uncommon. Preliminary
results also indicate that chiral cationic Co(I)-complexes catalyze at least 4 other types of reactions
(hydroboration, hydroacylation and hydrosilylation of prochiral 1,3-dienes, and, cyclizaion/HV of 1,6-
enynes). We plan to explore how many of the combinations of reactions can be run in tandem, in
attempts to exploit the full potential of the new cobalt chemistry in organic syntheis. Historically
some of the reactions we work on had been carried out using precious metals. We expect, when
fully devloped, cobalt (which is 100 to 200 time cheaper than Rh for example), will be able to
catalyze some of these basic reactions. The interdisciplinary nature of the work proposed here
provides outstanding opportunities to train future scientists at every level of their education."

Pancreatic cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death with less than 5% (5-year) survival rate with
current treatment regimen involving chemo-radiation therapy. Almost all patients with pancreatic cancer
eventually develop metastatic disease with poor prognosis for survival. There remains a significant opportunity
for breakthrough strategies to improve the quality of life and outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients. Recent
studies have shown some success with proton therapy and the interest in proton RT has grown progressively
with increasing evidence indicating substantial benefit over photons (XRT). The success of proton therapy relies
on precise delivery of high dose in tumor tissue, sparing normal tissue due to the nature of its Bragg’s peak,
while maintaining similar therapeutic advantages as XRT. Carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) offers steep
Bragg’s peak and less scatter but also higher LET (Linear Energy Transfer), resulting in greater ionizing events
and greater biological damage. We hypothesize that greater complex DNA damage also defined as relative
biological effect (RBE) of CIRT can induce stronger immune response. In the current proposal, we are testing
the hypothesis that high-LET CIRT has unique ability of enhancing tumor immune response, when applied alone
or combine with other immunotherapeutic agents. Our goal is to determine the immunomodulation effectiveness
of CIRT compared to XRT in pancreatic cancer mouse model. We will test the effect of high LET-CIRT on tumor
cells as well as the immune cells at local and systemic level. We will correlate biological end points such as DNA
double strand breaks (DSB), complex DNA damage and clonogenic survival in XRT/CIRT-irradiated cells with
their ability to induce immune response under aim 1. We will also determine whether HDAC inhibition enhances
antigen presentation by pancreatic tumor cells in aim 2. Under aim 3, we will enhance the efficacy of CIRT by
reprogramming tumor microenvironment (TME) using concurrent treatment with check point inhibitors and
antigen presentation activators.
Relevance. Successful completion of these studies could establish the significance and help us design unique
combination therapy of immunotherapy with CIRT for solid tumors."

 Impaired diastolic relaxation, an important component of diastolic dysfunction, is present in nearly all
patients with heart failure-both with reduced and with preserved ejection fraction- and is present in nearly 25%
of asymptomatic individuals. Unfortunately, no treatments for impaired relaxation exist. Recently, my lab
identified and defined Mechanical Control of Relaxation as a faster relaxation rate in response to the rate of a
lengthening strain. In other words, the relaxation rate is sensitive to the strain rate of the myocardium. Our
data demonstrate that this mechanical regulation of relaxation can increase the relaxation rate two-fold beyond
the biochemical processes that limit myosin detachment from actin, including calcium removal and thin filament
deactivation. Thus, diastolic dysfunction might result from two factors: i) a loss of the sensitivity of relaxation to
strain rate and ii) an attenuation in strain, restricting the strain rate. The molecular mechanism underlying
strain-rate sensitivity remains unknown, but our preliminary studies indicate that myosin detachment kinetics
are key. Strain-sensitive myosin detachment is a poorly characterized biophysical property, especially in intact
cardiac tissues. Our preliminary data further demonstrates that in vivo hemodynamics can alter myocardial
strain. The global hypothesis of this proposal is that myosin-detachment kinetics biophysically regulates
Mechanical Control of Relaxation. The goals of this project are to confirm this mechanism and to identify
molecular and hemodynamic factors that regulate Mechanical Control of Relaxation. Aim 1 will determine
whether myosin detachment rate modifies the sensitivity of the relaxation rate to the strain rate. We
hypothesize that both myosin isoforms and myosin activating drugs will modify the strain-sensitive detachment
rate of myosin. Using myosin isoform altering treatments and myosin-specific activating drugs, we will
evaluate Mechanical Control of Relaxation using intact cardiac trabeculae. Importantly, we will assess myosin
head position using x-ray diffraction techniques. Aim 2 will determine the role of titin based stiffness on
Mechanical Control of Relaxation. Our preliminary studies suggest that high titin compliance eliminates a
length (preload)-dependent change in myosin detachment. We hypothesize that titin-mediated thick filament
extensibility is a mediator of relaxation and will test this hypothesis in trabeculae expressing altered titin
isoforms using the same techniques as in Aim 1. Aim 3 will determine how strain rate and/or the sensitivity of
the relaxation rate to the strain rate is modified in vivo using i) the molecular modifications studied in Aims 1
and 2 and ii) a clinically relevant Fructose+High Salt model that replicates several markers of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction. The proposed methods uniquely consider how the myocardium moves (strains)
throughout the cardiac cycle, an advance beyond standard methods (isolated myofibril, trabeculae) that are
isometric. These studies will drive the discovery of novel targets to improve the treatment and diagnosis of
impaired relaxation by isolating mechanisms underlying Mechanical Control of Relaxation."

Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with solid tumors. Since there are no clinically-
approved targeted therapies for treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), metastatic TNBC pre-
sents a dire clinical situation for which intervention strategies are urgently needed. The long-term goal
of this proposal is to elucidate novel tumor cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms that
drive TNBC progression and metastasis. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the molecu-
lar/cellular basis by which post-translational hypusination and nucleocytoplasmic transport of eukaryotic
initiation factor 5A (eIF5A1/2) governs pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase one (PEAK1)-dependent
invasion/dissemination and lipocalin two (LCN2)-mediated reprogramming of the premetastatic niche
(PMN). Toward this end, evidence is presented that the eIF5A1/2 hypusination/activation pathway
associates with poor TNBC prognosis and is required for TGFβ/PEAK1-driven metastasis and LCN2
expression in TNBC cells. Furthermore, the eIF5A1/2-LCN2 axis is identified as a novel mechanism
through which primary tumor cells remodel the PMN to support TNBC cell expansion. Thus, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that hypusination and cytoplasmic localization of eIF5A1/2 in TNBC cells
drives PEAK1-dependent TGFβ/fibronectin signaling crosstalk and LCN2-mediated anti-inflammatory
reprogramming of the premetastatic niche to support metastasis. The approach is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by elucidating targetable eIF5A1/2-dependent
translational mechanisms of cell state plasticity at early and late stages in the metastatic cascade using
the single-cell Cyclic ImmunoFluorescence (CycIF) platform, our novel in vivo/ex vivo tumor cell-free
PMN reprogramming assay, the Multifunctional Approach to Pharmacological Screening (MAPS)
platform and a suite of preclinical mouse models that faithfully recapitulate complementary aspects of
human TNBC metastasis and progression. Furthermore, the proposed research is significant because it
will define spatiotemporal mechanisms by which dysregulation of eIF5A1/2 expression, hypusination
and subcellular localization drive TNBC pathogenesis and identify targeted treatment strategies for
metastatic TNBC. Specific Aim 1 will determine cancer cell autonomous mechanisms of eIF5A1/2-
mediated TNBC cell invasion and dissemination. Specific Aim 2 will identify eIF5A1/2-dependent
mechanisms of premetastatic niche reprogramming that support TNBC cell seeding and expansion.
The collective knowledge gained from these studies will elucidate targetable mechanisms that govern
both early and late stages of TNBC metastasis and establish rationale for new therapeutic combina-
tions to overcome TNBC progression and improve patient outcomes."

Pain is the number one reason patients seek health care and greater than 20% of the US population is affected
by chronic pain. Existing therapeutics have limited efficacy and a narrow therapeutic period, while also evoking
deleterious side effects. It is therefore vital to understand pain processing in order to develop novel
therapeutics to address this pressing health care crisis. According to the International Association for the Study
of Pain (IASP) pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential
tissue damage”. Intrinsic to the emotional suffering elicited by pain perception is the attribution of a negative
valence to nociceptive stimuli. Dysregulation of aversive motivational circuits may underlie much of the
suffering associated with chronic pain conditions. Hedonic valence is a measurement of the intrinsic
attractiveness (positive) or averseness (negative) of a stimulus. Pain typically has a negative valence, which is
normally advantageous, driving self-protective behavior. Perversely, humans can sometimes assign a positive
valence to nociceptive stimuli; think pleasure from spicy foods. This implies that the neural circuits that assign
negative valence to nociceptive stimuli are malleable and that pain and aversion can be decoupled. Critically,
there have been limited tools to investigate how valence is assigned to nociceptive stimuli by the nervous
system. Here, we propose to investigate the effects on nociceptive processing by Analgesic Screen 1 (AS1), a
small molecule we discovered that reverses the hedonic motivation (movement toward or away from) of
nociceptive stimuli including heat and the noxious chemical allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in larval zebrafish,
rendering these highly aversive stimuli attractive or rewarding in a dose dependent manner. Remarkably, AS1
can tune the valence of nociceptive stimuli, transforming the valence from aversive to neutral to attractive. AS1
has no previously identified target or function. We hypothesize that AS1 potentiates the activity of the
dopamine reward system via D1 receptor activation by promoting release of dopamine in the presence of
nociceptive stimuli. Experiments in this proposal will make use of the unique advantages of the zebrafish and
mouse model systems to test these hypotheses and when completed, we will have characterized the effects of
AS1 on nociception and identified upon which neural circuits AS1 acts to invert the valence of nociceptive
stimuli from aversive to attractive. In Aim 1, we propose to determine the effects of AS1 on aversion evoked by
nociceptive and other aversive stimuli and how these stimuli alter neuronal activity in the CNS in the presence
or absence of AS1 in zebrafish. In Aim 2, we will use a comprehensive genetic approach to assess the role of
D1 receptor dependent dopaminergic signaling on aversion elicited by nociceptive stimuli in the presence or
absence of AS1 in zebrafish. In Aim 3, we will ascertain the effect of AS1 on nociception, place aversion,
whether these effects are dependent on D1 receptor activation and where AS1 effects neuronal activity in the
CNS in response to nociceptive stimuli using the mouse model system."

Despite therapeutic advances, over 600,000 people in the US will die from cancer in 2019. Preventing cancer
eliminates the risk of mortality and/or morbidity that may occur with the development of cancer. Thus, cancer
prevention represents the most effective way for addressing cancer challenges. Healthy diet is considered be
essential to reduce cancer risk by maintaining and improving immunity, but recent VITAL trials did not show
beneficial effects of these supplements. The negative results reflect the mechanistic knowledge gap of how
dietary factors modulate health. The objectives of this renewal application are to determine cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which epithelial fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) promotes n-3 fatty acid-
mediated tumor prevention by enhancing immune cell differentiation and anti-tumor activity. Data collected in
the last funding cycle have successfully established E-FABP as a new host-derived cancer prevention factor in
non-obese subjects. During our studies, we observed that different types of high fat diets (HFD, 45% fat),
including cocoa butter (rich in saturated fatty acids, FAs), safflower oil (rich in 18:2 linoleic acid), fish oil (rich in
n-3 FAs), all induced similar degree of obesity in mouse models. However, tumor growth in these obese mice
was dramatically different with the fastest growth in cocoa butter group and slowest in the fish oil group. In
analyzing the immunophenotype of these obese mice, we found an atypical population of CD8+ γδ T cells that
was specifically upregulated in the fish oil group. More interestingly, fish oil diet-induced CD8+ γδ T
differentiation and anti-tumor effects were blunted in mice lacking E-FABP, suggesting a novel molecular
mechanism mediated by E-FABP. Thus, we hypothesized that host expression of E-FABP plays a critical role
in n-3 FA-induced immune cell differentiation and anti-tumor function. Three specific aims are proposed to
address the central hypothesis in this renewal application. Specific Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by
which E-FABP promotes n-3 FA-induced immune cell differentiation. Experiments are designed to elucidate
molecular mechanisms by which consumption of dietary n-3 FAs regulate CD8+ γδ T cell differentiation via E-
FABP-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. Specific Aim 2 will delineate how E-FABP mediates n-3 FA-
induced anti-tumor activity. Results of Aim 2 are expected to reveal that E-FABP promotes host anti-tumor
activity through targeting both immune cells and tumor-derived epithelial cells. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate
whether targeting E-FABP with optimized n-3 FA diets results in effective tumor prevention. In summary,
successful completion of this proposal will offer E-FABP as a new cancer prevention target and have
significant mechanistic and clinical implications for healthy diet-mediated cancer prevention."

Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 14 million Americans by 2050. To
date, though, research on the signs and symptoms of ADRD has been sparse in early midlife populations,
especially at the national level. It is crucial to conduct such research because early changes in cognitive
functioning and the accumulation of risk factors for ADRD can begin decades before concrete signs and
symptoms emerge. The challenging search for the causes of ADRD has made it clear that prospective and
comprehensive data—including detailed social, biological, and health measurements across the life course—
are needed to identify key predictors of ADRD. As such, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health) provides an extraordinary opportunity to study the early origins of cognitive
functioning/change and ADRD risk in a nationally representative cohort that has been followed since
adolescence and will be in their mid-40s in the next wave of data collection (Wave VI). The overall goal of this
project is to collect and disseminate critical data related to cognitive, physical, and sensory functioning in
conjunction with the Add Health Wave VI Core Project to facilitate identification of early risk factors for later life
ADRD. Adding such rich measures to Wave VI of Add Health will make possible tracking of cognitive, sensory,
and physical functioning across the life course; coupled with the testing of biological risk markers, it will also lay
the foundation for detecting signs of cognitive impairment and ADRD risk in early midlife. These new data,
when combined with Add Health's existing 25-year collection of extraordinarily rich multi-level and longitudinal
measures and its new Wave VI data, will also aid in the scientific community's understanding of the interplay of
social, behavioral, and biological factors leading to ADRD in later life. Moreover, because Add Health is a very
diverse sample, adding these data to Wave VI will greatly increase understanding of cognitive, physical, and
sensory functioning within health disparity populations. The project's specific aims are to: 1) Collect new in-
depth, in-person assessments of cognitive functioning in early midlife for a nationally representative and
racially/ethnically diverse subsample of participants in Wave VI; 2) Collect automated, (largely) web-based
measures of cognition in early midlife for all participants in Wave VI and compare them with our in-person
measures of cognition to assess their feasibility and value; 3) Include assessments of physical and sensory
functioning in early midlife for Wave VI participants of Add Health; 4) Test for biological markers of ADRD risk
and cognitive function in early midlife; 5) Clean, document, disseminate, promote, and support the data
collected in this project for the scientific community. All told, this project will collect and disseminate innovative

10894164,"This LD Hub P20 renewal entitled, “Determinants of phenotypes within the word reading (dis)ability
population: The impact of diverse language experiences and child attributes on emerging reading skills”
responds to the NICHD invitation for LD Innovation Hubs, FOA’s (RFA-HD-22-005). The overarching goal of this
LD Hub is to continue to lay the foundation for a generation of research that situates educational practices in a
novel theory of individual word reading development. The knowledge and product generated from this Hub will
be used to inform future behavioral, computational, and neurobiological studies examining the development of
word reading skills and will be used to align theories describing the relations between child- and word-attributes
that explain individual differences in word reading more closely with the educational challenges confronting
educators of typically developing (TD) and more specifically children with reading disability (RD), while also
expanding our understanding of where important differences exist in under-represented populations in RD
research. The proposal addresses the second priority of the RFA; namely “pushing innovation”, by exploring
new and complex behavioral phenotypes of RD that vary as a function of child experience and cognitive ability
across linguistically diverse samples of learners. Our LD Hub adopts an interdisciplinary approach to developing
the foundational and translational research needed to better understand the general development of item-level
word reading skill in a large portion of the English language, explore important differences in word reading
development across TD and RD populations with a focus on important historically under-represented
populations, and examine the interactions between child- and word-attributes that explain individual differences
in word reading development. The overall specific aims for the Hub include: (1) expand our understanding of
the basic mechanisms undergirding word reading development in English; (2) increase the scientific
infrastructure for research on reading disability by establishing a publicly available database
(developmental English Lexicon Project) incorporating all of the data collected in the research project;
(3) maintain and expand the Hub’s multidisciplinary team of experienced and early researchers with
expertise spanning educational, computational, and neurobiological research; and (4) strengthen the
scientific workforce by providing career enhancing opportunities for early career scientist and by
promoting its diversity through the participation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, and
persons with disabilities. In achieving these aims, we will create a research team, a body of empirical
knowledge, and a theoretical framework setting the stage for (i) better educational practices, particularly related
to RD; (ii) translational research on related topics such as literacy acquisition by English Language Learners
(ELL) and speakers of dialects, and second-language acquisition; and (iii) a new generation of theories
embracing individual differences and strongly tied to the neurobiological bases of learning."
10758211,"Project Summary
 Alcohol misuse levies a major impact on public health, yet the brain mechanisms underlying how this
substance drives its misuse are poorly understood. This proposal seeks to discover a novel mechanism
underlying the rewarding properties of alcohol. Data derived from this study stand to provide novel treatment
strategies aimed at blunting the rewarding effects of alcohol in those suffering from alcohol use disorders. The
motivation to seek and acquire rewards is encoded by the output of a key reward integration center in the brain,
the nucleus accumbens. Inhibitory synapses in this structure powerfully gate its output. Our preliminary
experimentation indicates that alcohol pathologically disinhibits the nucleus accumbens by hijacking a form of
synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. This novel mechanism positions alcohol as a pathological enhancer of
nucleus accumbens output and reward encoding. To elucidate this further, we propose three aims of
investigation using cutting-edge approaches: 1) to determine the neural circuit components necessary for driving
ethanol enhancement of this synaptic plasticity; 2) to determine the molecular mechanism mediating ethanol
enhancement of this form of plasticity and; 3) to causally determine how ethanol enhances NAc-iLTD reward
encoding in vivo. The results of this study stand to significantly advance our understanding of alcohol action in
the brain and provide important insight to myriad neuropsychiatric disorders involving nucleus accumbens
synaptic dysplasticity."
10843051,"ABSTRACT – INFORMATION SYSTEMS SHARED RESOURCE 
 The Duke Cancer Institute Information Systems (DCI-IS) shared resource provides critical information 
systems and expertise to support DCI members with the clinical, translational, and basic biomedical research. 
The goal of the resource is to deliver comprehensive computational support that provides DCI investigators the 
breadth of technology to accomplish their research goals. DCI-IS is available to DCI members and their 
laboratories and personnel at no charge. Support for DCI-IS comes from a combination of Cancer Center Support 
Grant, DCI and institutional funding. In addition to infrastructure, DCI-IS provides DCI members technical 
support, application and hardware assistance, and consultation for database development, application 
development, and web development. The resource provides call-in support, assistance, and consultation for 
electronic data capture (EDC), database development, application development, website development and 
server provisioning. In addition to application and data server support, DCI-IS provides support for large scale 
servers and software for the DCI's Biostatistics and Bioinformatics shared resource. DCI-IS leverages the Duke 
IT and Informatics resources, including Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS), Duke Office of Instructional 
Technology (OIT), Duke Office of Clinical Research (DOCR), and other institutional groups to leverage 
enterprise-level IT expertise, experience, and resources to efficiently meet the needs of DCI members. Several 
primary benefits of DCI-IS for DCI members are: 1) an agile, experienced team, highly skilled in cancer research- 
related IT; 2) specialized support; 3) 21CFR Part 11-compliant electronic data capture (EDC) system 
development; 4) user training and ongoing support; 5) expeditious responses to complex and intricate requests; 
6) provisioning of infrastructure; and 7) hardware and software to meet the computing needs of both DCI 
members and other DCI-based shared resources. 
 In 2018, DCI-IS provided services to 164 investigators, 100% of whom were DCI members, accounting for 
100% of usage, from all 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of DCI-IS by DCI members contributed to 138 
publications over the current project period, 23 of which were in high impact journals (Impact Factor>9), 
demonstrating the value of DCI-IS services."
10843057,"ABSTRACT – OPTICAL MOLECULAR IMAGING AND ANALYSIS SHARED RESOURCE 
 The Optical Molecular Imaging and Analysis (OMIA) shared resource provides in vivo optical imaging and 
spectroscopy ranging from whole animal fluorescence and bioluminescence to functional intravital microscopy. 
OMIA services can be broken down broadly according to the following categories: 1) optical imaging, 2) window 
chamber surgery training and support, 3) user training in techniques, and 4) scientific guidance on experimental 
design, data analysis and interpretation. 
 Within optical imaging, two primary technological approaches are in vivo whole animal bioluminescence and 
fluorescence imaging. These are achieved using a set of commercial imaging devices, namely the IVIS Lumina 
and Kinetic, as well as FMT2500LX fluorescence tomography system (all from PerkinElmer). A third major 
technological approach within optical imaging is intravital microscopy. This approach is facilitated through 
resources developed over many years in the laboratories of the shared resource co-directors. The available 
resources include a surgical facility and the supplies needed for performing surgeries, as well as microscopes 
suitable for intravital functional imaging. Together, these three optical imaging capabilities, plus the other 
expertise, training, and services of OMIA, provide a unique resource for DCI members to study cancer 
therapeutics and tumor biology. 
 This is a vital shared resource that, in 2018, provided services to 38 investigators, 71% of whom were DCI 
members, accounting for 74% of total usage, from all 8 DCI Research Programs. DCI members benefit in 
particular due to the availability of cost offsets that are proportional to the DCI contribution (typically 10-30% 
based on the service), as well as a wide range of cancer models, which account for the majority of the utilization 
of these services. The impact of this facility on DCI members is best highlighted by the fact that this shared 
resource contributed to 83 publications over the project period, 15 of which were in high impact journals (Impact 
Factor >9), demonstrating the value of services offered by the resource."
10843067,"ABSTRACT – HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES AND CELLULAR THERAPIES PROGRAM 
 The Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapies Program (HMCT) is a multidisciplinary clinical, basic 
and translational research effort whose theme is to facilitate research with the ultimate objective to improve 
outcomes for patients with hematological malignancies. The broad, long-term goals of HMCT are to build on and 
extend current knowledge in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy and 
hematological malignancies, and to develop novel strategies for improving therapeutic results in patients with 
hematological malignancies through a collaborative and integrated approach involving the basic, translational 
and clinical investigators of HMCT. 
 The HMCT has two focus areas related to our scientific aims and theme: 1) Understanding the interplay 
between hematopoietic/immune cells and their microenvironment with respect to immune activation and 
suppression; and 2) translating laboratory-based observations to clinical trials. Among the strengths of the 
program are the significant numbers of physician scientists working on fundamental problems in hematological 
malignancies and who are able to take the basic observations at the bench to the bedside through extensive 
collaborations with the clinical researchers. Specially, the scientific goals of the HMCT Program are: 1) To 
understand the role of the external environment and microenvironment in immune responses; 2) To elucidate 
the role of immune and stromal cells in anti-tumor responses and graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD); 3) To develop 
and execute investigator-initiated translational trials for hematologic malignancies - all with the goal to stimulate 
and facilitate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations; 4) To further advance genomic signatures in 
hematological malignancies and evaluate the role of different signaling mechanisms and; 5) To train the next 
generation of MD, PhD, and M.D./Ph.D. students, postdoctoral, fellows, residents in the field of adult and 
pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy and hematological malignancies. 
 The Program includes 36 primary and 9 secondary members from 6 departments and two schools within 
Duke University. Total direct funding for program members is $17.2M, of which $4.4M is peer-reviewed, including 
$1.6M from the NCI. From 2014- 2018, program members published 457 papers in peer-reviewed journals, 21% 
were intra-programmatic and 28% were inter-programmatic collaborations. During the current grant period, the 
program enrolled 1,519 subjects to all trials, 923 to interventional trials, and 587 to treatment trials."
10843071,"ABSTRACT – SOLID TUMOR THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM 
 The Duke Cancer Institute’s Solid Tumor Therapeutics Program (STT) focuses on disease-specific drug 
development and testing in the following disease groups: gastrointestinal cancers (esophageal, gastric, small 
intestine, colorectal, anal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic), genitourinary cancers (kidney, bladder, prostate, 
testicular), thoracic cancers (lung), sarcoma, melanoma and head and neck cancers. Most solid tumors share 
common alterations in the major signaling pathways regulating development and homeostasis, including the 
EGF, TGF-β, PDGF, VEGF, FGFR, IGF, Hh, Wnt, Src and c-Met pathways. In addition, solid tumors share 
conserved roles for the tumor microenvironment (i.e., immune system, angiogenesis). Further, gaining insight 
into the cancer cell autonomous and tumor microenvironment alterations that will result in improvements in 
clinical practice requires the development of more relevant pre-clinical models to execute co-clinical trials. 
 Accordingly, the Program’s overarching goal is to increase disease-specific drug development and testing 
with investigator-initiated trials based on the early stage drug discovery and lead development efforts at Duke 
University. The STT theme is to align the research efforts across these disease sites to increase disease-specific 
investigator initiated clinical trials. STT is organized into three focus groups: Signal Transduction Pathways, 
Tumor Microenvironment/Immunotherapy, and Preclinical Modeling. These efforts will enable us to leverage 
early stage drug discovery and lead development efforts at Duke, and increase disease-specific drug 
development and testing with investigator-initiated trials, including Phase I experimental therapeutics. 
 Close collaboration with the Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program and Office of Health Equity 
also enables race-stratified clinical trials and assessing of cancer healthcare delivery measures including cost 
and health economics, and outcomes including patient-reported outcomes, quality and value-base care, and 
cancer disparities. Opportunities for translational and clinical trial development will occur through the NCI 
Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network with Phase I emphasis (ET-CTN) grant and the National 
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) lead academic site grant, both of which are led by investigators in this Program. 
 STT is comprised of 60 primary members and 26 secondary members from 12 different departments in 3 
schools within Duke University. Total funding for primary program members is $20M, of which $4.4M is peer 
reviewed, including $1.8M from the NCI. From 2014-2018, Program members published 1,395 papers in peer- 
reviewed journals, 33% were intra-programmatic and 39% were inter-programmatic collaborations. During the 
current grant period, the Program enrolled 3,823 subjects to all trials, 2,216 to interventional trials, and 1,516 to 
treatment trials."
10843073,"ABSTRACT – TUMOR BIOLOGY PROGRAM 
 Genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications alter protein signaling networks and metabolites to promote 
cancer. Basic research connecting signaling or metabolism to tumor biology has laid the foundation for recent 
targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy, and will no doubt continue to provide 
novel avenues for therapeutic development in the future. Given this understanding, the Tumor Biology Program 
(TB) provides a critical hub for basic research in the areas of cancer signaling and metabolism in the Duke 
Cancer Institute (DCI). The TB aims to collectively foster current and seed future basic research in these two 
research areas in order to promote foundational advancements in cancer biology. TB supports this theme 
through three aims: 1) foster high-impact, basic research in cancer signaling and metabolism; 2) promote 
transdisciplinary research in these fields; and 3) train the next generation of basic cancer researchers. These 
aims are achieved through a seminar series, weekly transdisciplinary work-in-progress meetings, an annual 
transdisciplinary joint retreat, pilot grants, development of multi-PI grants, as well as other targeted research and 
training initiatives. 
 The program is comprised of 29 primary members and 26 secondary members from 10 different departments 
and 3 schools within Duke University. Primary members anchor high-impact, basic research and training the two 
research focus areas in cancer signaling and metabolism, and were chosen given their research expertise in 
these areas and their accomplishments, with one quarter of being fellows of the American Association for the 
Advancement of the Sciences, a quarter are active or alum HHMI investigators, one is a National Academy 
member and another a Nobel laureate. Secondary members provide key connections to other programs, centers, 
departments, and institutes, to promote transdisciplinary research in cancer signaling and metabolism. Total 
direct funding for primary program members is $6.4M, of which $5.4M is peer reviewed, including $2.7M from 
the NCI. From 2014-2018, program members published 465 papers in peer-reviewed journals, 15% were intra- 
programmatic collaborations and 38% were inter-programmatic collaborations, reflecting TB efforts to promote 
transdisciplinary research in cancer signaling and metabolism. Over the last renewal period one third of all 
publications appeared in high-impact journals reflecting TB efforts to promote high-impact, basic research in 
cancer signaling and metabolism. Additionally, the efforts of TB to build a cancer metabolism research base has 
led to a tripling in the number of papers in this research area. Finally, primary members have trained 125 
students and 158 fellows over the last decade with 96% and 90%, respectively, continuing on to research or 
research-related careers, reflecting TB efforts to train the next generation of basic cancer researchers."
10843077,"ABSTRACT – PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM 
 Duke Cancer Institute’s Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) falls within the scope of 
responsibility of the Cancer Protocol Committee (CPC). The CPC is responsible for implementation of the PRMS 
function, including evaluating the scientific merit and progress of all studies that meet the DCI definition of 
“cancer-related”. While the CPC upholds standards in scientific rigor and integrity during the protocol review 
process, it also helps investigators and study teams attain such standards by providing essential resources and 
education. By meeting its scientific oversight responsibilities, the CPC ensures that DCI investigators conduct 
high quality and impactful clinical research that aligns with the DCI’s research priorities and meets the needs of 
the cancer patient community. In addition, the CPC works closely with the clinical Disease Groups and DCI 
CCSG Research Programs in the prioritization of clinical trials for review. 
 The CPC is a scientific peer-review committee comprised of 40 voting members that reflect the 
multidisciplinary clinical research enterprise at the DCI. The CPC membership is selected to ensure diverse 
expertise relevant to cancer clinical research and is composed of clinical investigators, investigational 
pharmacists, biostatisticians, translational PhD scientists, and patient advocates. All cancer-related protocols 
are approved by the CPC prior to activation and approved studies that remain open to enrollment must undergo 
continuing review by the CPC every six months from study activation. Studies reviewed include interventional 
(treatment, preventive, supportive, diagnostic) and non-interventional (ancillary, correlative [tissue-based], 
observational) studies. In addition, amendments to cancer-related studies are prospectively assessed and 
reviewed by the CPC. 
 The CPC approves well-designed studies that hold the potential to positively affect cancer care and has the 
authority to terminate studies that fail to demonstrate meaningful progress or lose relevance due to shifting 
paradigms of cancer research and cancer patient care. During the past project period, CPC reviewed a total of 
1,316 new protocols, 918 annual renewals, and 322 amendments."
10843080,"ABSTRACT – CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT 
 The DCI Clinical Protocol Data Management (CPDM) team resides in the Clinical Research Office (CRO) 
and provides comprehensive protocol and data management services to DCI members including development, 
conduct, data management, monitoring and reporting of cancer-related clinical research. The CPDM mission is 
to provide the infrastructure for centralized processes that allow the facilitation, assessment of the scientific merit, 
progress, QA, safety and reporting of all cancer-related clinical protocols to support the DCI’s mission of providing 
novel and innovative therapies to all of our patients affected by cancer. 
 The CPDM provides comprehensive clinical research protocol services to DCI members from concept 
development, regulatory submission, data reporting, protocol monitoring, and close out. This centralized 
approach allows the CRO to proactively assess the clinical trials portfolio, its performance, compliance with 
regulatory standards, and its alignment with DCI and institutional priorities. 
 The DCI CRO provides comprehensive data and metrics to the DCI leadership, multidisciplinary Disease 
Groups, Research Program leaders, and investigators to support their operations and decisions. The CPDM 
enables the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) to analyze protocol startup and approval times in 
order to identify gaps in review process to provide ongoing efficiency. CPDM also permits the DCI to comply with 
federally mandated ClinicalTrials.gov and NCI Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) requirements. The 
CPDM facilitates design and development of clinical trial databases in a 21CFR Part 11 compliant electronic 
data capture platforms. 
 During the past project period, the CPDM expanded the use of technology to facilitate efficacy and efficiency. 
With the School of Medicine, DCI implemented an electronic regulatory platform (Complion), Clinical Trials 
Management System (OnCore), a new eIRB system (iRIS) and a DCI membership console to collect shared 
resource utilization by research program and track member publications. 
 The CPDM’s overarching goal is to ensure access to clinical trials for all of our patients. Special efforts are 
undertaken to provide the opportunity for patients to participate in clinical trials regardless of sex/gender, race, 
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or age. During the current 5 year grant period, the DCI enrolled 13,826 subjects 
on clinical research protocols, including 7,413 subjects to interventional trials and 540 pediatric subjects. Enrolled 
subjects based on total accrual included 7,919 (57.3%) females and 2,954 (21%) minorities. There is also a 
substantial commitment to support of National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and UM1/ETCTN studies, with 
358 patients accrued to adult NCTN treatment studies, 319 enrolled to NCORP studies, 279 enrolled to pediatric 
COG studies and 102 patients accrued to UM1/ETCTN studies over the past 5 years."
10843085,"ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT 
 Since Duke Cancer Institute’s (DCI) inception in 2011, significant effort has gone into enhancing DCI 
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and addressing cancer health disparities. DCI uses patient data 
analytics to define its Catchment Area (CA) to the 85th percentile of its patient base, focused primarily on central 
North Carolina. DCI’s CA cancer burden was defined using a 3-pronged approach: 1) DCI senior leaders served 
with the State of North Carolina Advisory Committee on Cancer Coordination and Control (NC-ACCCC), the NC 
Cancer Prevention and Control Branch, and the NC Cancer Registry, to help conduct a county by county analysis 
of all cancers with a focus on cancers for which NC incidence and mortality rates either exceed the national 
averages, exhibit significant disparities, and/or are preventable; 2) DCI created a 20-member Community 
Advisory Board representing its local diversity and embarked on an extensive three-year community needs 
assessment campaign; and 3) DCI was one of the fifteen awardees in the first round NCI P30 supplements 
(2017) to assess the cancer risks and needs of its catchment area. DCI focuses significant effort on Community 
Outreach and Engagement (COE) including the 2012 launch of the DCI Office of Health Equity (OHE). Through 
these coordinated efforts DCI has identified prostate, lung, high-risk breast cancer, and GI cancers including 
colorectal and stomach, which are either major CA cancer burdens and/or disproportionately affect minority 
populations, as “priority” target cancers in the next grant period. Tobacco, obesity and infectious agents were 
identified as major risk factors and cancer disparities identified as a major crosscutting challenge. This analysis 
guides our community engagement, community-based interventions, cancer care services, cancer health policy 
advocacy and research. DCI members conduct ground-breaking, multi-level research on these cancers and risk 
factors including research directed at understanding the social, structural and biological drivers of cancer 
disparities, as well as developing and implementing interventions. DCI COE is overseen by DCI’s Deputy 
Director, Steven Patierno, a nationally recognized expert in cancer disparities research and intervention. He 
works closely with Nadine Barrett, DCI Associate Director for COE, who also holds a joint DCI-CTSA sponsored 
position of Director of “Alliances for Community Engagement and Stakeholder Strategy” (ACESS). 
 The Specific Aims for the next five years of DCI COE are: 1) to monitor the cancer-relevant needs of our 
Catchment Area to inform research relevant to our catchment area’s needs; 2) to perform research relevant to 
our catchment area’s needs and enhance the impact of our Cancer Center’s research to our Catchment Area; 
3) to engage our Catchment Area communities in evidence-based strategies for cancer prevention, screening, 
treatment and outcomes research, with particular emphasis on underserved populations; 4) to extend DCI’s 
reach within and beyond our catchment area, through affiliates and other networks that bring DCI’s expertise to 
bear on wider populations, rural populations, and global cancer research."
10778640,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Measuring dynamic guanosine signaling at the site of focal ischemia over time remains challenging to probe with
existing technology yet knowledge of the dynamics, regulatory mechanisms, and function of local guanosine
fluctuations during ischemia would positively impact our understanding of the brain’s immediate local
neuroprotective response. Guanosine is a nucleoside purine which has been postulated to play a potent restorative
role after ischemic injury; however, to date, the mechanism and dynamics of guanosine action in the brain remains
unresolved. Additionally, knowledge of the extent to which guanosine signaling changes as a function of ischemia
duration and severity would provide critical insight into guanosine’s role as a neuroprotector. We propose to solve
a significant gap in the understanding of guanosine signaling dynamics during focal ischemia by developing a
microfluidic platform to initiate sustained local oxygen-glucose deprivation in a sub-region of a brain slice and using
fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) recording of guanosine with millisecond-to-second temporal resolution to
provide critical insight into the mechanisms of guanosine regulation. Measuring local guanosine dynamics at the
site of injury with significantly improved spatiotemporal resolution will provide critical information of the brain’s
immediate local damage response. This proposal fits within our long-term goal to develop analytical tools to detect
and understand dynamic neurochemical-regulated inflammation in the brain during injury. The rationale for this
proposal is that these tools will provide knowledge of the dynamics, mechanism, and function of rapid guanosine
signaling in the brain during ischemia for the first time which could further inform the development of guanosine-
targeted therapies for neurological injury. The proposal will be completed by the following three specific aims: (1)
Develop microfluidic platforms for delivery of spatiotemporally controlled and sustained focal ischemia to brain
slices, (2) Characterize the mechanism of rapid guanosine release and clearance in the hippocampus as a function
of ischemia severity and location, and (3) Characterize the impact of rapid guanosine signaling on local adenosine
changes during focal ischemia. We will pursue these aims with an innovative approach by using novel microfluidic
platforms for time-controlled delivery of ischemia to brain slices coupled to rapid electrochemical recording of
guanosine signaling with FSCV for the first time. This work is significant because these studies will enable
extraordinary mechanistic insight into the brain’s immediate response to ischemia over varying ischemia durations
and severities which will directly impact future therapeutic strategies for brain injury. The tools are translatable to
any biological system to study local tissue responses. The expected outcome is a new platform to investigate rapid
endogenous guanosine signaling in the brain for the first time and an in-depth understanding of guanosine
regulation and neuromodulation during ischemia. This work will have a positive impact on how guanosine is studied
and will significantly advance knowledge of guanosine’s role in the brains immediate damage response."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation is increasingly
recognized to play a critical function. While innate inflammation has been implicated in AD, little is known about
the contribution of the adaptive immune response. Preliminary data featured in this application demonstrate a
peripheral immune signature of AD characterized by increased numbers of highly-differentiated CD8+ T effector
memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells. Strikingly, CD8+ TEMRA cells were also present in patient cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing indicated their clonal expansion, suggesting antigen specificity of
these adaptive immune cells. TCR cloning and peptide screens demonstrated specificity of a subset of clonally
expanded AD CSF TCRs to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 antigen. These results provide the first evidence
of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related
neurodegeneration. This K99/R00 application will test the novel theory of a detrimental adaptive immune
response contributing to AD pathobiology. In Specific Aim 1, AD blood-CSF T cell clonotypes will be related to
CSF biomarkers. This approach will determine specific T cell populations in AD and whether these cells relate
to disease severity. In Specific Aim 2, antigen identification screens will be used to detect the self/non-self
antigen(s) driving T cell clonal expansion in AD. These assays could uncover a novel therapeutic target or
biomarker for AD. Specific Aim 3 will determine mechanisms of T cell-mediated neuronal death and resiliency
in AD using induced neuronal (iN) cells co-cultured with patient CSF CD8+ T cells. These experiments will assess
whether AD CSF CD8+ T cells mount cytotoxic effector responses to iN cells infected with EBV and/or to a
molecular mimic of BZLF1. The candidate, Dr. David Gate, has extensive experience in T cell biology and has
spent more than a decade studying AD. During the mentoring phase of this award, Dr. Gate aims to advance his
knowledge in next-generation sequencing analysis, sophisticated statistical methods, antigen screening, iN
culturing methods and CRISPR gene editing. Dr. Gate's mentor and co-mentor, Dr. Tony Wyss-Coray and Dr.
Mark Davis, respectively, have comprehensive expertise in these areas. They will provide an enriching
environment for Dr. Gate to develop as a prominent independent investigator in neuroimmunology research. As
an independent investigator, Dr. Gate will leverage the training under this fellowship to comprehensively and
quantitatively evaluate the interactions between T cell molecular components and neurodegeneration."
10544997,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cost-effective, brief programs to support family communication and improve mental health in youth are a
pressing need; yet few evidence-based programs exist. Our group has developed and rigorously tested an
empirically-supported family-systems approach to improving communication and conflict in families, thereby
improving mental health in youth. Beneficial effects for youth mental health and other indices of adjustment
associated with the Happy Families Curriculum have been supported in several efficacy trials with families from
a variety risk contexts. However, the value of efficacy research is limited unless it is subsequently tested in the
context of an effectiveness trial. Given the potential large-scale benefits of broad implementation of the Happy
Families Curriculum, a critical need exists for an effectiveness trial to evaluate the program when it is
implemented in community settings by facilitators who would provide the program in “real world” settings. Our
objective in this proposal is to test the effectiveness for a large sample, in different contexts of risk, of the brief
(i.e. 4 session) psycho-educational and communication training approach used in our efficacy trials, and to
examine the mechanisms associated with change processes that occur as a result of the program, including
emotional security as a mediator of program effects and moderators of effects associated with participants’
socioeconomic and contextual risks as well as organizational factors that may impact program effectiveness.
Our central hypothesis is that participation in the program will improve patterns of communication and conflict
in families, thereby improving youth mental health. This hypothesis is supported by extensive efficacy research
on the Happy Families Curriculum and conclusions based on a recently conducted feasibility study of the
proposed effectiveness trial. Our rationale is that providing a family-systems approach to improving the family
environment will support youth mental health over time. The specific aims are: (1) evaluating program
effectiveness for improving communication, reducing destructive conflict in families and enhancing mental
health in youth, (2) testing process models, guided by the Emotional Security Theory (EST; Davies &
Cummings, 1994), to explain how, why, for whom and when, changes occur as a result of the program, and (3)
evaluating organizational factors associated with program effectiveness, including the impact of organization
structure and facilitator type, and organizations’ subjective evaluation of the program. This approach is
innovative because it utilizes an RCT design to test the effectiveness of a proven family-systems approach that
represents a brief, inexpensive and readily scalable approach to foster change in families’ communication
patterns and improve mental health. The program is based on a well-established theoretical model for
“mechanisms of effect” and backed by evidence for program efficacy. This research is significant because it
will result in an inexpensive model program for family-system-level interventions that is sustainable in the
organizations it is tested in, and readily adjusted to other contexts."
10747335,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) kills nearly 13,000 people annually in the United States1. MM is preceded by a less life-
threating blood condition, which is similar to MM, yet non-lethal and asymptomatic2. in fact, most people don’t
even know they have it. An outstanding question in MM research is why some patients diagnosed with the
precursor condition go on to develop the full disease and why others do not. This question has been approached
from a genetics standpoint, however there is no clear genetic link defining who goes on to develop MM from a
precursor condition and who does not. Bone marrow creates a microenvironment to support developing blood
cells. Multiple myeloma hijacks the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) to favor its own growth3. Without a
genetic driver of cancer development, I hypothesize that the BMM is modified epigenetically to facilitate the
selective growth of MM.
Epigenetics encompasses that which influences the expression of genes without altering the genes themselves.
Chromatin regulators (CRs) are proteins that mediate epigenetic changes through altering the ability of a cell to
express a given gene. CRs carry out this process through modifying the histone proteins around which genes
are wrapped (histones and DNA taken together comprise chromatin, hence: chromatin regulators). In addition to
these very specific functions, CRs can also mediate interactions with transcription factors (TFs), the proteins that
turn the expression levels of genes up or down. A specific CR LSD1, which is known to repress or turn off genes,
has been the target of other blood cancer diseases and drugs designed to block LSD1 activity are quite effective
in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)45. These drugs work by disrupting an interaction between LSD1 and
another protein. When that interaction is disrupted, a master TF is able to turn on genes that cause AML cells to
die5. Despite some similarities between AML and MM, treatment with LSD1-targeting drugs actually enhances
the growth of MM6. Interestingly, a small subset of patients have been found to be predisposed to MM
development through a heritable set of mutations in LSD1 – these mutations mimic mutations that confer drug
resistance in AML5,6. While these mutations only make up a small fraction of MM cases, it points to LSD1 as a
key component in the development of MM7. I thereby hypothesize that LSD1 plays a role in the progression of
MM; this role is potentially specific to the BMM. The specific aims of this project can be summarized as follows:
 1. Develop a computational tool using novel techniques from machine learning and mathematics to learn
 about factors that drive the BMM to contribute to the progression of MM.
 2. Collect BMM samples from patients across a spectrum of MM development to analyze single cell gene
 expression and chromatin accessibility data to learn the ways in which the epigenome is altered as MM
 progresses in the BMM."

Regular exercise improves numerous metabolic and cardiovascular health traits and prevents or delays the
development of cardiometabolic disease. Despite the pleiotropic health effects of exercise, there are
substantial inter-individual differences in the cardiometabolic responses to regular exercise, even to rigorously
standardized exercise programs. The ability to systematically interrogate metabolites and proteins that are
downstream of the genome makes plasma metabolomics and proteomics well-suited for investigating exercise-
induced cardiometabolic adaptations. Recently, our group leveraged a non-targeted metabolite profiling
method to identify dimethylguanidino valeric acid (DMGV) as a novel, early biomarker of cardiometabolic
disease. DMGV lies in a biochemical pathway catalyzed by the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2
(AGXT2) that features multiple bioactive substrates and products that are stimulated by exercise, regulate
exercise metabolism, or affect cardiovascular physiology. These findings motivated our recent investigation of
DMGV as a biomarker of metabolic responsiveness to exercise training (ET), in which we demonstrated that
individuals with higher baseline levels of DMGV are less responsive to improvements in lipid traits and insulin
sensitivity with ET. However, few data are available for other metabolites and proteins related to this novel
pathway in the context of exercise responsiveness.
The HEalth, RIsk factors, exercise Training And GEnetics (HERITAGE) Family Study provides an excellent
resource for a comprehensive study of DMGV and additional molecular correlates of the cardiometabolic
responses to aerobic ET. We hypothesize that bioactive AGXT2 pathway members will be associated with
exercise trait responsiveness (i.e. VO2max, insulin sensitivity, visceral fat, and HDL-cholesterol) based on
plausible biologic relationships. We further hypothesize that integrating large-scale metabolomics and
proteomics with these key phenotypes will identify additional plasma biomarkers that help determine which
individuals benefit most from regular exercise.
In Specific Aim 1, we will relate AGXT2 pathway participants to ET-induced outcomes of VO2max, insulin
sensitivity, visceral fat, and HDL-cholesterol. We will then extend our investigations to a full panel of ~800
known metabolites/lipids and ~5000 proteins to create comprehensive plasma biochemical/molecular
signatures of exercise responsiveness for each of the four clinical traits. We will validate top findings in the
NIH's Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) Study of over 800 healthy adults assigned to an
endurance ET program. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify the genetic determinants of “exercise response”
metabolites and proteins. These genetic loci will then be interrogated in: 1) HERITAGE to test for their
relationship with exercise trait responses; and 2) large genetics meta-analyses for associations with
cardiometabolic traits and long-term outcomes (Mendelian Randomization)."

10749874,"Project Summary/Abstract
For proper assembly of neuronal circuitry, axons have to be guided toward the correct targets and dendrites
need to have the correct branching pattern and structural specialization. Despite considerable recent
progress, much less is known about molecular mechanisms that control dendrite development as compared
to those controlling axon guidance. About 15 years ago, our lab initiated a fruitful genetic dissection of
dendrite development using Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons as a model system. Multiple
genetic screens and the ensuing analysis of dendrite mutants have yielded important insights about the
molecular basis of dendrite development in Drosophila, including how axons and dendrites are made
differently, how a neuron acquires its neuronal type specific morphology, how the dendrites of different
neurons are organized relative to one another, how the size of a dendritic arbor is controlled, and how the
pruning and remodeling of dendrites are regulated during development. Many of the molecular mechanisms
controlling dendrite development have turned out to be conserved between Drosophila and mammals. Given
that defects in dendrites are strongly associated with diseases such as Down syndrome and a subset of
autism spectrum disorder, elucidating molecular pathways that control dendritic morphogenesis is not only of
great interest in basic neuroscience but also important for the potential relevance to neurological disorders.
As we continue to investigate the mechanisms that control dendrite morphogenesis, the knowledge we
have gained provide a solid foundation for exploring some very interesting and understudied areas about
dendrites: (1) The function of dendrites and the relationship between form and function. Drosophila da
neurons are sensory neurons; all of them are mechano-sensitive. This has led us to venture into the study of
mechano-sensation, the least well understood among our senses. Very few molecules have been firmly
established as mechano-transduction channels. By using da neurons, we discovered that NompC is a bona
fide mechano-transduction channel that enables the fly to sense gentle touch. We have also provided strong
evidence that NompC is gated mechanically by a tethering mechanism that involves the Ankyrin repeats of
NompC functioning as a gating spring. We propose to continue the in depth study of how NompC transduces
force. Furthermore, because there are still many novel mechano-sensitive channels that remain to be
discovered, we will use the fly sensory neuron as a model system to identify and study them. (2) Dendrite
regeneration after injury. By using da neurons that are well suited for studying both axon regeneration and
dendrite regeneration, we have been able to identify novel regulators of axon regeneration. Compare to axon
regeneration, much less is known about dendrite regeneration (a recent PubMed search revealed over 1400
papers on axon regeneration but only 4 on dendrite regeneration to date). We are keen about uncovering
mechanisms that control dendrite regeneration, an important but so far little studied problem."
10747339,"Significant advances in melanoma research have resulted in new therapies that have remarkably improved the
management and overall survival of melanoma. However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more
than half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we
developed a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using
genomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their
ability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant
BRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a
mean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and
brain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly,
this model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis.
Elucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic
targets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic
and metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis.
Our data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors
and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and
this was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results
in increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite
these promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes
melanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in
this disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve
patient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools
and assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry
out and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test
the following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain
metastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy
and; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development
of melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the
field by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients
with brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases."
10794212,"Project Summary
We propose to optimize and validate two novel diffusion MRI models/methods that have direct clinical
relevance for cervical spinal cord evaluation in health and multiple sclerosis (MS): Neurite Orientation
Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Spherical Means Technique (SMT). While diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) has existed for 20 years, advanced biophysical models for evaluating neurological disease in the
CSC are lacking. Advanced diffusion MRI can extract indices related to neural architecture and axonal loss, yet
evaluating the pathological substrates of MS (specifically axonal loss) in the CSC is undertested and questions
remain if the models as-developed are relevant for pathology. Lastly, it is not clear if advanced diffusion MRI
offers greater clinical value over DTI. We address the current knowledge gap in human CSC diffusion MRI by
optimizing and evaluating two clinically-approachable diffusion techniques: NODDI and SMT in healthy
volunteers and patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to 1) study lesion and normal appearing white
matter (NAWM) in comparison with conventional DTI (assessing value), lesion burden, and atrophy (reflecting
axonal loss) and 2) to assess the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to tissue change over time. In MS, spinal cord
health is integral to neurological function, yet current studies rely on identifying lesions and/or tissue atrophy;
the biological substrates of CSC tissue damage are poorly characterized, and their relationship to neurological
function is weak. Advanced diffusion MRI provides estimates of axonal volume, cellular inflammation, and
neurite dispersion and may provide greater specificity than DTI for microstructural changes in the CSC
throughout MS evolution. However, advanced diffusion MRI has only recently been explored due to lack of
CSC-optimized acquisitions and models that account for pathology, which we show are surmountable. We will
test the hypotheses that NODDI and SMT diffusion MRI, can 1) detect sub-radiological axonal pathology in MS
(CSC areas devoid of lesions), 2) offer improved value and specificity over conventional DTI, and 3)
characterize axonal-sensitive indices longitudinally concomitant with neurological deterioration. We optimize,
and acquire NODDI and SMT data in addition to DTI, T2-, T2*-, T1 MRI in the CSC of patients with RRMS. We
published NODDI and SMT in the CSC in a small cohort of RRMS patients, but now evaluate the value that
advanced diffusion modeling in the CSC can add to the clinical assessment of MS patients. As in the brain,
NODDI and SMT can be acquired in a reasonable exam time, but are untested for spinal cord pathology in MS.
If successful, we will offer clinically-relevant, optimized acquisition and analysis tools for the application of
advanced diffusion MRI in CSC pathology in comparison with clinical radiological standards. Alternatively, we
will solidify the importance (and provide optimized CSC sequences) for rapid, conventional CSC DTI for clinical
deployment. A byproduct is the evaluation of alternative models in pathology, which has not been tested before
and have direct benefit to understanding other spinal cord diseases."
10762458,"Light regulated vascular development in the eye via the Hippo pathway
Our recent studies show that opsin-mediated light responses function as developmental timing
cues for vascular development within the eye. 480 nm blue light stimulation of melanopsin (OPN4)
regulates the numbers of retinal neurons that develop and, via oxygen demand, the level of
VEGFA expression. We have also shown that after birth, neuropsin (OPN5), a 380 nm violet light
responsive opsin, normally suppresses the level of dopamine, a neuromodulator that has an anti-
vascular activity through suppression of VEGFA signaling.
 This application has two goals. (1) In the near-term, we aim to understand, using the
mouse as a model system, the mechanisms that integrate the OPN4 and OPN5 pathway
responses in the regulation of hyaloid vessel regression. Our preliminary data show that the Hippo
pathway is required for normal hyaloid regression and further, that it integrates the OPN4 and
OPN5 light responses. This is an important finding because the Hippo pathway is known to play
a central role in cell survival. To understand these mechanisms, we propose three experimental
aims that will examine, (Aim 1) how the OPN4-VEGFA pathway regulates hyaloid Hippo
responses, (Aim 2) how the OPN5-dopamine pathway regulates hyaloid Hippo responses, and
(Aim 3) the mechanisms of cross-talk between the two light response pathways. In Aim 3, we will
also determine whether light manipulations alone can be used to regulate hyaloid vessel
regression. This is important because it is dovetails with long-term goal (2) of devising a non-
invasive, light stimulation therapy for retinopathy of prematurity. When this work is complete,
we expect to emerge with new knowledge of the mechanisms of vascular development in
the eye that will lay the groundwork for a new therapeutic option for retinopathy of
prematurity."
10755711,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this grant in recent years has been to describe in molecular detail the mechanism of
action of physiologically important human forms of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). During the course of these
studies, we have discovered that the activity of this superfamily of enzymes depends critically on the
interaction of two large macromolecules (the protein and the large lipid aggregate), where the orientation of
the enzyme with respect to the plane of the lipid-water interface can have a dramatic effect on activity. The
nature of this interaction has been challenging to explore, but we have now shown that association of the
membrane or micelle interface with the enzyme causes an allosteric activation through a resulting
conformational change. This renewal application will extend our current studies on the pure recombinant
human cytosolic Group IVA cPLA2, secretory Group V sPLA2, Ca2+-independent Group VIA iPLA2, and
lipoprotein-associated PLA2/PAF (platelet-activating factor) acetyl hydrolase Group VIIA LpPLA2. During the
renewal period, we will focus on three new directions. First, we will explore the further role of additional
allosteric sites on iPLA2 (for ATP and calmodulin) and cPLA2 (for PIP2) for enzyme regulation and as drug
targets. Second, we will expand and apply what we learned with phospholipases to triglyceride lipases
starting with PNPLA3, which contains a patatin-like domain and is homologous to the catalytic domain of
iPLA2. PNPLA3 is of great interest because GWAS studies have shown that a natural mutation (I148M)
enriched in the Hispanic population leads to an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the
advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our lipidomics analysis shows that the pure
recombinant human mutant PNPLA3 has decreased triglyceride hydrolase activity and our MD studies show
that the catalytic site has adopted to a triacylglyceride substrate rather than the phospholipid substrate in
iPLA2. Third, we will explore the functioning and physiological role of the various intracellular phospholipase
A2s in relevant intact cells, where the actual specificity will depend on the proximity and availability of optimal
phospholipid molecular species. Although we have developed a novel lipidomics assay of PLA2 specificity
and function in vitro, one barrier to progress in this field is the lack of methods for determining PLA2 activity in
living cells. To address this issue, we have developed a new platform for measuring PLA2 specificity and
inhibition ex vivo in macrophage cells in culture. This work has and will generate important widely applicable
novel information on how physiologically important phospholipases and triacylglycerol lipases interact with
the lipid-water interfaces of membranes, micelles and lipid droplets to compete physiologically in selecting
their substrates. This work should enable us to fully explain and integrate at a structural level the resulting
specificity of multiple members of the PLA2 superfamily acting in vitro with the specific molecular species of
phospholipids hydrolyzed and the specific fatty acids released as well as correlating with ex vivo specificity."
10766717,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality and disability, especially in the
elderly population. Accumulating evidence suggest that circulating pro-aging factors derived from distal organs
exacerbate the aging of vascular system. Particularly, there is a link between bone metabolism and the
vasculature. Clinical studies have shown an inverse, independent correlation between osteoporosis and vascular
events, such as aortic stiffening and cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, the bone-vascular interplay likely
involves mechanisms underlying the aging of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system. Our goal is to identify
skeleton-derived factors that accelerate vascular aging through blood circulation. We recently found that old
animals have elevated serum level of angiogenesis factor PDGF-BB and develop increased aortic stiffness and
reduced density and integrity of brain capillaries relative to young mice. Importantly, acute infusion of aged
plasma into young mice induces an elevation in serum PDGF-BB concentration and a similar cerebrovascular
phenotype as seen in aged mice. We previously found that pre-osteoclasts (Pre-OCs) in bone/bone marrow is a
major cell type that secret PDGF-BB. Our preliminary data show that Pre-OCs undergo cellular senescence and
secrete high amount of PDGF-BB during aging. Our results suggest that Pre-OCs in bone/bone marrow is a
main source of elevated circulating PDGF-BB during aging. While PDGF-BB maintains the homeostasis of
vasculature under physiological conditions, abnormally high concentration of PDGF-BB may lead to vascular
impairment. Our central hypothesis is that skeleton-derived PDGF-BB is a systemic pro-aging factor to
exacerbate arterial stiffening and cerebrovascular dysfunction. In Aim 1, we will establish the role of PDGF-BB
as a systemic factor to exacerbate vascular aging by conducting plasma transfer and heterochonic parabiosis
studies to examine whether young mice develop age-associated aortic and cerebrovascular phenotype by
exposure to the blood of aged mice or Pdgfb transgenic mice. In Aim 2, we will define the contribution of
senescent Pre-OCs to vascular aging by conducting bone marrow transplantation experiments. We will also test
if ablation of Pre-OCs or inhibition of the senescence of Pre-OCs rescues the aortic and cerebrovascular
pathologies in aged mice. Positive findings will uncover the mechanisms by which skeletal cells regulate vascular
aging and will provide an unconventional but promising path for the treatment of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases."
10766716,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aging is responsible for the majority of fractures in both women and men. The cellular changes in the skeleton
of aged mice are similar to those observed in aged humans. In mice, trabecular bone loss is associated with low
bone remodeling, while cortical thinning and porosity are associated with high bone remodeling. These findings
suggest that different molecular mechanisms underlie the bone loss in these two compartments. Cellular
senescence contributes to the functional decline of multiple tissues with age and DNA damage is a major cause
of senescence. DNA damage causes senescence via activation of p53 and up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor
p21 and/or p16. DNA damage also causes accumulation of the transcription factor GATA4, which promotes the
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Systemic clearance of senescent cells delays several age-
associated disorders and increases bone mass in old mice. We have shown that the number of osteoprogenitors
in murine bone marrow declines with age and that these cells have increased markers of senescence. Cortical
osteocytes also exhibit increased markers of senescence in aged mice and this is associated with elevated
production of RANKL. Induction of senescence in bone organ cultures by DNA damage is sufficient to increase
GATA4 and RANKL production. Moreover, overexpression of GATA4 in vitro is sufficient to increase RANKL
and other components of the SASP. Administration of senolytics to old mice attenuates markers of senescence
in osteoprogenitors and osteocytes. Notably, mice lacking RANKL in osteocytes are protected from the loss of
cortical but not trabecular bone with age. We hypothesize that activation of p53/p21 in osteoprogenitors
causes their senescence and thereby decreases osteoblast number and bone formation and that
accumulation of senescent osteocytes in cortical, but not trabecular, bone increases RANKL and bone
resorption via GATA4 stimulation. In Aim 1 we will determine whether DNA damage in osteoblast lineage cells
is sufficient to induce senescence and reduce bone mass. To do this, we will generate mice with oxidative stress-
induced senescence in either the entire osteoblast lineage or only in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes.
Administration of the senolytic PZ15227 will reveal what components of the phenotype are due to senescence.
In Aim 2 we will determine the contribution of the p53/p21 pathway in osteoprogenitors to skeletal aging by aging
mice with p53 or p21 loss-of-function. In Aim 3 we will investigate the differential contribution of senescent
osteocytes to increased bone resorption in trabecular versus cortical bone with age by aging mice with GATA4
loss-of-function in osteocytes. We will also quantify osteocyte senescence in cortical versus trabecular bone and
determine whether senescent osteocytes express higher levels of RANKL. Successful completion of these
studies should establish for the first time whether senescence of osteoprogenitors and osteocytes contributes to
the loss of bone mass with age, and help clarify different aging mechanisms in cortical versus trabecular bone."
10760250,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The objectives of this proposal are two-fold and include the development and conceptual advancement of contra-
thermodynamic catalysis and fluorine sculpting. The realization of both objectives will elevate the field of synthesis and
positively impact human health through the development of tools for synthesis and chemical biology. While at first blush
the directions appear disparate, they both rely heavily on visible light photocatalysis. However, they deviate from one
another in the manner in which the excited state photocatalyst is quenched. One by triplet sensitization (Dexter energy
transfer), and the other by SET to or from an excited state catalyst.
 Traditional catalysis has the effect of lowering energy barriers and facilitating reactions but ultimately does not alter the
thermodynamics (or spontaneous direction) of the reaction. Our long term objectives are to develop strategies to realize a
system that makes formerly impossible, or endergonic, synthesis possible in addition to enabling exergonic synthesis.
Achieving this objective, will result in new tools for the study of large molecules, new synthetic methods. Achieving this
objective will require the development of reactions which are not subject to the principles of microscopic reversibility, i.e.
irreversible reactions that can serve to pump energy into the system, and the ability to harness and store the energy
thermodynamic currency that can be used to drive reactions. More tangibly we seek to leverage the cis-to-trans
photoisomerization of cycloalkenes to: identify energy pumping reactions, define an energetic currency, and develop
strategies to spend the energetic currency to drive reactions that would be otherwise impossible. Realizing these objectives
is expected to both enable synthesis via the development of new endergonic (neglecting the photon energy) reactions and
methods as well as the development of biological tools that capitalize on the available energy and the spatio-temporal
controlled associated with light activated processes.
 The second direction of this proposal also involves an unorthodox approach to synthesis. Like no other element, fluorine
has the ability to modulate the properties of a molecule and its behavior within the human body. Fluorine incorporation
into pharmaceuticals has seen exponential growth in recent years, and yet our synthetic capability to obtain organofluorines
is surprisingly limited. Owing to fluorine’s location on the periodic table, the selective installation of C–F bonds are
exceptionally challenging. Fluorine sculpting is an alternative approach to organofluorine synthesis that begins with a low
cost perfluoroarene and selectively carves out the desired high-value organofluorine. It has shown great promise; providing
rapid access to organofluorines. Our long term objective is to advance the concept of fluorine sculpting and provide
expanded access to organofluorines of unprecedented structural complexity. This newfound ability is expected to result in
greater understanding of the role fluorine plays in molecules of interest to human health."
10762437,"In sensory cells of the eye and inner ear the neurotransmitter glutamate is released at active zones in a graded
and continuous manner. These cells have evolved specialized structures known as synaptic ribbons. These
proteinaceous structures tether synaptic vesicles near active zones. Based on their location, abundance of
tethered vesicles, and properties of the sensory neurons in which they are found, these organelles have long
been thought to be important for maintaining the continuous release of glutamate. Several other functions have
also been ascribed to ribbons. However, recent evidence casts doubt on these ideas. The focus of this grant is
to understand the role of synaptic ribbons in sensory synaptic transmission using animal models that lack
Ribeye, a protein that is both the most abundant within the ribbon and not found anywhere else. Lack of Ribeye
leads to loss of membrane associated synaptic ribbons, without loss of other presynaptic proteins. Specific Aim 1
investigates how Ribeye removal and loss of synaptic ribbons affects neurotransmitter release from
photoreceptors. Specific Aim 2 looks at the properties of synaptic release in bipolar cells from the same animals.
In Specific Aim 3, we will image single synaptic vesicles in cells lacking Ribeye to measure rates of vesicle
movement and replenishment to test the role of the ribbon in these processes. Understanding ribbon function
may provide clues to help understand diseases that specifically affect vision and hearing. In addition, the
fundamental understanding of presynaptic processes in these specialized neurons will have broader implications
for neuronal communication in general and thus, may contribute to our understanding of various aspects of
mental health and neurological disorders."
10812984,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The role of ionizing radiation as an “in situ” vaccine is based on radiation’s ability to induce the release of tumor
antigens which activate antigen-presenting cells to prime CD8+ T cells. This mediates the “abscopal effect” in
which radiation to one tumor leads to eradication of a distant tumor. However, clinical reports of the “abscopal
effect” are rare, possibly because radiation can promote the generation of immunosuppressive cells. While
radiation has been used therapeutically for over a century, it is still poorly understood which types of cell death
are induced by different types of radiation regimens and how these mechanisms of cell death effect the
inflammatory milieu and anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, while T cells are very sensitive to apoptosis, but
tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are radioresistant. Group 1, 2 and 3 ILCs are activated by specific
members of the IL-1 family of cytokines which serve as “alarmins” of tissue damage. However, the precise
contribution of cell death to IL-1 cytokine release and downstream immune responses has not been well
characterized, and ILC have never been implicated in the immune response to radiation. Therefore, the proposed
experiments will address critical gaps by examining how radiotherapy-induced mechanisms of cell death release
specific IL-1 family cytokines in the tumor micorenvironment to activate various ILC subsets (Aim 1). The K99
mentored experiments will involve the integration of patient derived organoids, cell death assays, and novel
orthotopic murine tumor models, as well as knockout mice for various cytokines. Results from Aim 1 will lead to
subsequent R00 independent phase investigations to determine how radiation-induced immune responses
regulate the balance between anti-tumor immunity (Aim 2) and radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis (Aim
3). Aim 3 will build on my doctoral work generating the IL-22-IRES-BFP reporter mouse to study the role of this
ILC3-induced cytokine in radiation-induced fibrosis. Collectively, the research will yield unprecedented insight
into how radiation-induced cell death mechanisms and specific cytokines direct downstream immune responses
and clinical outcomes. The technical training and career development obtained during the R99 phase will help
me to launch my independent research program and reveal additional questions for future investigation. Results
from this work will serve as preliminary data for a translational study to investigate if there is a correlation between
radiation-induced cell death, release of IL-1 cytokine family members, immune cell activation, and clinical
outcomes. Given my comprehensive training and experience in both immunology and radiation oncology, I am
uniquely positioned to utilize both skillsets to address important questions at the intersection of these fields and
gain fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the efficacy of radiation therapy."
10769773,"Project Summary:
One of the recent advances in cancer treatment is the development of immunotherapy largely
through targeting the checkpoint receptors. However, attempts at immunotherapy to increase
antitumor immune responses have achieved very limited success. A major hurdle in tumor
immunotherapy is mediated by regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress the function of antitumor
effector T cells. The lineage transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (FoxP3) is known as a
programmer for Treg adaptation in the harsh tumor microenvironment such as metabolic changes
and hypoxia. However, the factors that control FoxP3-mediated Treg fitness to orchestrate the
survival and functions of intratumoral Treg cells have not been identified. Importantly, our recent
publications and preliminary discoveries in the current application suggest that tumor
microenvironment factors possibly induce Treg fitness/adaptation through selectively
upregulating a deubiquitinase module, including USP21 and USP22, but not USP7, of FoxP3 to
control Treg adaptation. The current proposed studies will identify the tumor microenvironment
factors that induce USP21 and USP22 expression in Tregs (Aim 1), and to test whether Tregs
with simultaneous USP21 and USP22 deletion fail to adapt in the harsh tumor microenvironment,
which consequently potentiates the antitumor immune therapy (Aim 2). Results from our proposed
study will define a novel molecular cue in control Treg fitness to the tumor microenvironment and
provide a rationale for the combined USP21 and USP22 suppression in antitumor immune therapy."

impairment) on oral anticoagulant (OAC) use and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). I will examine
relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and clinical outcomes such as bleeding and medication
adherence. I will also examine relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and patient reported outcomes
that are not readily available in the medical record but are increasingly important to patients, their families and
clinicians such as patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life. Then, I will conduct focus groups of SAGE-
AF participants (92% report willingness to continue in SAGE-AF) and stakeholders to understand protective
factors that influence anticoagulation success among patients with psychiatric multimorbidity, including factors
that are not evaluated in the SAGE-AF data. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine the relationship between
psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC prescribing in AF; 2) Among OAC users, examine longitudinal associations
between psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC success indicators and patient reported outcomes over 2 years;
and 3) Conduct 6-8 qualitative focus groups including SAGE-AF participants, their caregivers and their clinicians,
to identify factors that influence OAC success. This proposal aligns with NHLBI’s overarching objective 3 by
investigating factors that account for differences in health among populations and has high potential to identify
factors that can be useful targets for patient-centered interventions."
10772194,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
An attractive modality for bone and soft tissue regeneration involves the use of pluripotent mesenchymal stem
cells that are induced by osteogenic and dermogenic cues. Furthermore, the delivery of engineered cells within
3D-printed, “smart” scaffolds tailored to any shape would make an ideal approach to rapidly repair battlefield
injuries. Our overall goal is to investigate capacity of BMP-9-induced, Notch pathway-synergized human adult-
derived urine stem cells seeded onto unique, polydiocitrate-graphene hybrid scaffolds, to heal critical-sized multi-
tissue defects in the rat scalp/cranium. This project is based on the hypothesis that the combination of BMP-9-
Notch-induced stem cell osteogenesis and a three-dimensional scaffold capable of hosting stem cell
differentiation along osteogenic and dermogenic lineages will lead to adequate reconstruction of critical-sized
multi-tissue craniofacial defects. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) To
investigate the mechanisms by which BMP9 induced human urine progenitor stem cells (HUPs) repair trauma-
induced cranial defects in vivo; 2) To develop structural composite scaffolds that can be customized to fit and
regenerate a critical-sized skin and bone calvarial defect in a rodent model. These specific aims will be addressed
by the following experimental design: 1) Treatment of critical-sized rat cranial defects with iHUPs transduced
with BMP9 and abrogation of defect healing with Notch inhibition and; 2) Design and incorporation of 3D-printable
mPOC-graphene/A5G81-PPCN hybrid scaffolds using micro-CLIP technology and testing of scaffold
permutations in a novel multi-tissue rat scalp-cranial defect."
10814758,"Regulation of Ku70 Methylation and Functions by SETD4
(Abstract)
The objective of this study is to elucidate a novel regulatory mechanism of Ku70 functions that are controlled by
lysine methylation. Ku70 is a critical protein in DNA damage repair, especially during the initiation of non-
homologous end-joining after irradiation. This function is carried out by its dimerization with Ku80 and encircling
of DNA at the break sites. The free form of Ku70 is known for its anti-apoptosis activity in the cytoplasm, due to
its binding with the pro-apoptosis protein BAX. Our preliminary studies suggest that SETD4, a putative non-
histone methyl-transferase, methylated Ku70 to cause Ku70 relocation to the cytoplasm. Over-expression of
SETD4 suppressed apoptosis, while SETD4 depletion sensitized it. SETD4’s chromatin-binding was dependent
on Ku70, but not vice versa. SETD4 can be recruited to DNA damage sites, but only at a relatively mid-late time
point after DNA damage. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that Ku70 methylation by SETD4 plays
a critical role for the functional translocation of Ku70 from DNA double strand breaks (DSB) to the cytoplasm.
We have generated highly specific antibodies against methylated Ku70 and SETD4, and several Ku70 and
SETD4 knock-in mouse lines. We strive to use a combined approach that integrates biochemistry, cell and
molecular biology, and mouse genetics to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will focus on Ku70-methylation and
its anti-apoptotic and DNA repair activities. First, the consequence of Ku70 methylation on Ku70/Ku80 dimer
stability and its binding to DNA will be determined. Second, the cytoplasmic activity of methylated Ku70 in
apoptosis will be verified with non-DNA damaging agents. Third, the direct effect of Ku70 methylation on Ku70
recruitment and retention at DNA damage sites, DSB repair efficiency, and cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation
will be measured. Lastly, we will use in-house developed Ku70 knock-in mice to characterize the functions of the
lysine-containing SAP domain of Ku70 and its methylation in vivo. In Aim 2, we will focus on how SETD4
regulates apoptosis and DNA damage response through Ku70. First, we will identify the structural elements that
are critical for SETD4 to methylate Ku70. Second, the consequence of SETD4 modulation on apoptosis will be
measured in cells incapable of Ku70 methylation. Third, we predict that, while Ku70 is required for SETD4
recruitment to DNA damage sites, the SETD4’s enzymatic activity may be required for Ku70 disassociation from
DNA damage sites. Thus, the mutual roles of SETD4 and Ku70 on their recruitment and/or retention at DNA
damage sites will be determined, and their effects on DNA repair will be assessed. Lastly, we have tagged the
floxed mouse Setd4 allele with V5 and Flag (V5F) epitopes. We will use this mouse line to systematically analyze
SETD4’s role in Ku70 methylation, and its subsequent contributions in development and tumorigenesis. These
studies are expected to elucidate a previous unknown mechanism that coordinates Ku70 functions in the nucleus
and cytoplasm. The success of this project is ensured by our unique reagents and animal models as part of a
rigorous approach."
10782988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our continued inability to develop selective therapies that prevent the emergence of disseminated breast tumor
cells into lethal metastases necessitates new approaches. We have shown that disseminated tumor cells
(DTCs) occupy the perivascular niche (PVN), that this niche promotes chemotherapeutic resistance, and that
targeting interactions between DTCs and the PVN sensitizes DTCs to chemotherapy. Translating this
approach to pre-clinical models of breast cancer prevented metastases in over 60% of at-risk mice.
Questioning the mechanism(s) of resistance in the remainder of mice led us to consider the dynamic response
of the vascular niche to chemotherapy. Our preliminary data indicate that genotoxic agents trigger the
secretion of pro-survival factors into the PVN, and that the major trigger of this chemotherapy-associated
vascular secretome is the DNA damage response (DDR). Therefore, here our goal is to target the cause (i.e.,
the DDR) and the consequence (i.e., the chemotherapy-associated vascular secretome) of vascular evolution,
which we suspect promotes therapeutic resistance of DTCs. We will pursue this goal through 2 specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. To determine whether individual extracellular factors elicited from vascular endothelium by
chemotherapy protect DTCs. We have defined a global vascular response to DNA damaging agents. Netrin-1
is a prominent component of this secretome with documented pro-survival functions. Our data show that endo-
thelial-derived Netrin-1 protects DTCs from chemotherapy. Using organotypic, transgenic and preclinical mod-
els, we will determine: i) whether endothelial cells are the relevant source of chemotherapy-elicited Netrin-1 in
vivo; ii) whether targeting Netrin-1 as an adjuvant sensitizes DTCs to chemotherapy; iii) whether this syner-
gizes with targeting pre-existing protective factors in the PVN; and iv) the safety of these approaches.
Specific Aim 2. To identify DNA damage driven signaling pathways in vascular endothelium that induce the
chemotherapy-associated vascular secretome. Our preliminary data demonstrate that genotoxic therapy elicits
a stereotypic DDR from quiescent endothelium, and that targeting a nucleator of this response mutes the ma-
jority of the chemotherapy-associated vascular secretome. This approach may be a more robust alternative to
targeting a single pro-survival factor such as Netrin-1. Here, we will identify and target the signaling pathway
that connects DDR to the vascular secretome, and measure the efficacy and toxicity of this approach.
The significance and innovation of this work lie in the discovery of origins and outputs of chemoprotective
factors in the DTC niche. Targeting both will result in the first approach to specifically target DTCs, impacting
breast cancer survival in a positive and lasting fashion."
10764264,"Project Summary
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in the US. Night and rotating shift work, ~20% of the
labor force, is associated with a greater incidence of both psychosocial stress and CV disease suggesting that
wakefulness and activity when the body is optimized for sleep and recovery is harmful to one’s health. Acute
stressors in the form of both heightened emotions in response to a psychosocial stress and moderate exercise
can trigger a CV event, however, the underlying physiology remains unclear. Endocannabinoids (eCB) are lipid
messengers that modulate the emotional and physiological response to stress and have also been demonstrated
to regulate CV function. Colleagues and I have recently demonstrated a robust endogenous circadian rhythm in
basal levels of circulating eCBs with a trough during the biological night. However, the circadian variation in eCB
reactivity, change from baseline in response to an acute stress, remains unclear. A difference in eCB response
and associated CV reactivity to an acute stress across the circadian system provides a plausible pathway that
could underlie risks for development of CV disease in shift workers. Thus, I aim to test the hypotheses that
changes of circulating eCBs in response to (a) an acute psychosocial stress and (b) a mild somatic stress
(exercise) are dependent upon circadian phase and will correlate with changes in emotional and CV reactivity.
The proposed research will take advantage of the opposite effects on mood of psychosocial stress (depressed
mood) and exercise stress (improved mood) to further examine how eCB regulation of emotional processing is
related to CV function. Additionally, as Black Americans have the highest age-adjusted CV disease mortality and
persistently demonstrate differential responses to stress this proposal will test the hypothesis that Blacks
compared to Whites will have attenuated eCB responses to psychosocial and somatic stressors. These aims will
be achieved via a multi-day circadian protocol (dim lighting free of time cues) with sleep-wake cycles adjusted
to recurring 18h cycles so that after numerous cycles all behaviors occur evenly across all circadian phases.
Assessments include circadian phase and amplitude from salivary melatonin, circulating eCBs from blood
plasma and mood from questionnaires. Relevant markers of CV function will include autonomic function and
markers of hemostasis. This protocol will be performed in 40 healthy adults as an additional component to my
primary mentor’s active project (R01HL142064, PI, Steven Shea). Elucidation of mechanisms that impact stress
reactivity across the circadian system integrates my prior training and is a logical progression in my research
career that will provide valuable information for evaluating the utility of evidence-based interventions. To achieve
my long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist translating stress and circadian research between the
laboratory and community, this K01 will provide further training in the following areas: 1) Standardization and
assessment of stress protocols; 2) Advanced statistical training for examining the temporal order of stress
markers; and 3) Knowledge on the etiology and prevention of sudden CV events and assessment of CV health."
10759385,"Background: This Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Services Research & Development Career Development
Award resubmission is a five-year plan that will enable the candidate, a staff cardiologist and specialist in
cardiac rehabilitation (CR) at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, to develop and implement
interventions to increase CR enrollment in Veterans. CR is an outpatient program including prescriptive
exercise and cardiac risk factor education that is an essential therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease.
This proposal will develop a tailored intervention to increase Veteran enrollment in CR.
Significance/Impact: CR is widely underutilized, with less than 20% of eligible patients enrolling in CR
programs nationally. CR utilization is particularly low among Veterans, with only 10% of eligible Veterans
enrolling in CR programs. Though CR referral rates have risen substantially over the past decade, CR
enrollment has remained static. It is imperative to study barriers to CR enrollment among Veterans that have
already been referred to CR and develop interventions tailored to these individual barriers.
Innovation: The applicant will develop a tailored intervention for increasing CR enrollment using the Obesity-
Related Behavioral Intervention Trials model, a conceptual model for intervention development, as well as the
information-motivation-behavioral skills model, a theory of behavior change that allows individual tailoring.
Linking these models will produce new knowledge regarding behavioral intervention methodology as well as an
innovative clinical intervention that can be delivered by nurses and other clinical staff at VA facilities. The
proposed intervention aligns with current VA initiatives by supporting CR enrollment wherever is most
convenient for Veterans (including VA CR programs, non-VA CR programs, and home-based CR programs).
Specific Aims: Aims 1 and 2 comprise a sequential explanatory mixed methods study to evaluate barriers to
CR enrollment among Veterans. The purpose of Aim 1 is to quantify barriers to CR in 100 Veterans
hospitalized with ischemic heart disease using the previously validated Beliefs About Cardiac Rehabilitation
Scale (BACRS). The purpose of Aim 2 is to reveal additional barriers to outpatient CR enrollment through
qualitative interviews in 30 Veterans from Aim 1 who did not enroll in CR. Aim 3 focuses on the iterative
development of a tailored intervention to increase outpatient CR enrollment in 3 groups of 5 hospitalized
Veterans, characterizing the intervention’s feasibility and acceptability. In Aim 4, the tailored intervention will
undergo proof-of-concept testing in a non-randomized group of 25 Veterans hospitalized with ischemic heart
disease. The applicant hypothesizes that these Veterans will have a clinically significant improvement in
BACRS summary scores after the intervention, representing a decrease in perceived barriers to CR.
Methodology: Aim 1 will quantitate the burden of CR barriers among Veterans by evaluating distributions of
BACRS summary scores and subscales. In Aim 2, the applicant will use intensity sampling to purposefully
select Veterans with the lowest individual BACRS subscale scores (and highest perceived barriers to CR) from
the Aim 1 cohort for semi-structured qualitative interviews. Aim 3 will use mixed data from Aims 1 and 2 and
serial formative evaluations to inform the iterative development of a tailored intervention. In Aim 4, the BACRS
will be administered before and after the intervention, characterizing the intervention’s effect on perceived
barriers to CR enrollment as measured by the BACRS summary score.
Implementation/Next Steps: The applicant will align the study activities with the QUERI Implementation
Roadmap and convene a Stakeholder Engagement Panel to ensure that the tailored intervention is developed
with maximum generalizability to other VA facilities. Findings from the proposed study will inform a wide range
of initiatives related to CR enrollment among Veterans and will be used to conduct a randomized clinical trial of
the tailored intervention within the context of an Investigator Initiated Research application."
10767854,"Summary: Exploring cyclic di-nucleotide signaling across the tree of life
All organisms utilize molecular regulatory mechanisms connecting external sensory systems to phenotypic
output. Cyclic di-nucleotide (cdN) second messenger molecules are one such fundamental system conserved
from bacteria to humans. In bacteria, cdNs regulate numerous phenotypes including but not limited to biofilm
formation, motility, virulence, stress responses, DNA repair, cell morphology, and phage defense. Eukaryotes
also utilize cdNs for complex multicellular development pathways and activation of the innate immune system
to mobilize anti-viral and anti-cancer immune responses. Although cdNs play such important functions across
the phylogenetic tree, they have only been intensively studied for about 15 years in bacteria and only a few
years in eukaryotic systems. There remain many outstanding questions such as the diversity of cdN signaling
systems, the environmental signals that induce their production, the molecular mechanisms that sense and
respond to them, the phenotypes cdNs regulate, and the adaptive benefit of such signaling systems. My
laboratory has studied cdN signaling since its inception in 2008, and we have made fundamental contributions
to this field. Our research has elucidated both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms by which the
cdN cyclic di-GMP regulates gene expression in the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae. We have also greatly
expanded our understanding of the phenotypes controlled by cyclic di-GMP including DNA repair, stress
responses, and cell curvature. We discovered and characterized the first bacterial protein receptor of cyclic
GMP-AMP, a phospholipase encoded by V. cholerae we named CapV. Our search for novel cdNs led us to
discover that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesizes cyclic di-UMP, the first pyrimidine cdN detected
in vivo, in response to heat shock. We propose to answer fundamental questions about cdNs by defining cyclic
di-GMP gene regulation and phenotypic control in V. cholerae and deciphering how such regulatory networks
impact bacterial fitness. Our studies will also further characterize the novel cyclic GMP-AMP pathway we have
discovered in V. cholerae and extend our studies of cyclic GMP-AMP-like signaling pathways into other
bacteria. Finally, we will identify the cyclic di-UMP synthase in S. cerevisiae, determine the impact of this cdN
on yeast physiology, and search for cyclic di-UMP signaling in other eukaryotic cells. Our explorations
spanning bacteria to eukaryotes will make significant contributions to answering fundamental questions about
cdN signaling."
10766182,"The pace of bone repair slows with aging, increasing the chance of developing a delayed union or non-union.
These complications are treated with surgical procedures causing significant morbidity and even mortality,
especially in older adults. Here we will build on our previous work using heterochronic parabiosis (in which two
mice of a different age share a blood supply) showing that exposure to a young circulation and young
macrophage cells rejuvenates fracture repair in older mice. In our preliminary data we used cell lineage tracing
analysis and parabiosis experiments to determine the developmental source of macrophage in fracture repair,
and found these derived from a subpopulation of cells of yolk sac origin. Interestingly these cells reside in the
spleen and are recruited through the circulation during bone repair. As mice age, this subpopulation of cells
becomes depleted. In this proposal we study the role of this cell population and the factors they produce in the
rejuvenation of fracture repair by undertaking the following aims:
 1) Identify the role of macrophages derived from yolk sac progenitors in the rejuvenation of
fracture repair. Heterochronic parabiosis in which these cells can be labeled or depleted will be investigated
to define the contribution of young cells from this population of macrophage cells that can improve the quality
of fracture repair in older animals.
 2) Determine the function of genes expressed in unique macrophage subpopulations present in
young mice in bone repair: We used single cell RNA sequencing and found a unique subpopulation of
macrophages cells present in bone repair in only young animals. Mice lacking genes which encode for
secreted proteins in various macrophage populations will be used in heterochronic parabiosis to determine
their contribution to the rejuvenation of fracture repair.
 3) Define how specific macrophage populations and the proteins they secrete alter
mesenchymal differentiation in fracture repair. Our prior work showed an important role for beta-catenin in
mesenchymal cell differentiation and in fracture repair rejuvenation. Here we will use in-vitro approaches to
determine how specific subpopulations of macrophage cells and the proteins they secrete alter mesenchymal
cell differentiation in cells from young and old animals. There will be an initial focus on beta-catenin, but an
unbiased approach will be used as well.
 This proposed work builds on our prior studies of rejuvenation by heterochronic parabiosis in fracture
repair. It will address critical gaps in our knowledge about the mechanism responsible for the rejuvenation
phenotype driven by heterochronic parabiosis. Our work will also identify a novel therapeutic approach to
address a critical clinical problem in older patients, delayed fracture healing."
10766733,"Stem cells are responsible for homeostasis and repair of many tissues in the body, and stem cell exhaustion
is one of the hallmarks of aging. In recent years, work from our group and others has drawn attention to the
mechanisms by which the resilience of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) declines with age at the population level and
at the single cell level. As one example, we have shown that a signaling pathway involving Notch activation and
increased p53 activity prevents MuSCs from undergoing a form of cell death, mitotic catastrophe, as they
activated out of quiescence and enter the cell cycle. This Notch/p53 axis declines with age and leads to an
increased propensity of aged MuSCs to undergo mitotic catastrophe, leading to a decline in MuSCs over time.
Furthermore, in preliminary studies, we have found that quiescent MuSCs exhibit evidence of replicative stress
and that an ATR response to that stress prevents cell cycle entry and preserves the MuSC population. We have
also found that dietary interventions, in particular fasting and a ketogenic diet, enhance MuSC resilience, perhaps
mediated by HDAC activity and p53 acetylation. Together, these observations highlight robust processes to
maintain MuSC resilience and prevent stem cell depletion, processes that go awry during the aging process.
The primary goals of this proposal are to explore these processes in more detail, to identify the molecular
mediators of each, to use unbiased screens to identify as yet unknown mediators, and to pursue rejuvenating
interventions that restore resiliency to aged MuSCs.
 To address these issues, this proposal is divided into three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To examine changes of
the Notch/p53 axis as a cause of the age-related reduction of MuSC resilience. We will use novel genetic models
to modulate Notch signaling in MuSCs and test for resilience signatures of cells protected against mitotic
catastrophe. We will also assess resilient cells for evidence of mediators downstream of p53 using single cell
RNA-seq. Aim 2: To examine replicative stress and the ATR response in young and old MuSCs. We will examine
a potential downstream mediator of ATR, CDK12, identified in a phosphoproteomic screen, in preserving
resilience of the population. We will also test whether this replicate stress response pathway changes with age
and protect MuSCs from undergoing mitotic catastrophe when they activate out of quiescence. Aim 3: To
elucidate the mechanisms by which ketosis promotes MuSC resilience. We will test for enhancement of resilience
using three different ketosis-inducing interventions, and we will test for mechanisms of action based on the well-
documented role of the major circulating ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), as an inhibitor of histone
deacetylases (HDACs). We will also test whether ketosis enhances MuSC resilience, at least in part, by
promoting p53 activity and preventing mitotic catastrophe. Together, these studies will advance our
understanding of the mechanisms of stem cell resiliency and how to enhance the resilience of aged stem cells
to promote tissue homeostasis and repair across the lifespan."
10766714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heterochronic parabiosis, in which young and aged animals are surgically attached to share circulation, provided
evidence of putative ‘anti-geronic’ factors exist but the mechanisms by which circulating factors mediate
rejuvenating properties on muscle stem cells and their microenvironment have yet to be elucidated. Due to the
complexity of in vivo parabiosis and the dynamic nature of blood-borne factors, reliable identification of these
humoral factors remains a major hurdle. To overcome this challenge, Dr. Jang and his team will leverage
advanced microengineering approaches to build a 3D microfluidic parabiosis circuit that can control mechanical
and biochemical cues in the physiologically relevant 3D microenvironment. In this proposal, his team will further
refine and upgrade the in vitro parabiosis platform by integrating a cell-type-specific protein labeling system
(MetRSL2774G transgene) to precisely identify muscle secretome, also known as myokines, responsible for
rejuvenation effects on muscle stem cells. In addition, the targeted genetics approach will be employed to
delineate oxidative stress-induced pro-geronic myokines that negatively impact muscle stem cell function.
Finally, the team will also engineer an exercise-induced myokine reporter system within parabiosis-on-a-chip
using an optogenetic actuator (Channelrhodopsin 2) co-expressed with protein labeling construct, MetRSL274G.
Using this reporter, proposed studies will identify novel contraction-induced myokines with anti-geronic properties
and myokines that pass the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) to exert their action on muscle-brain crosstalk. The
successful outcomes of this project will have far and broad implications in geroscience. This minimally invasive
3D microphysiological system can be exploited in a variety of studies testing the hallmarks of aging or modeling
of age-related diseases in vitro. More importantly, upon validation, the experimental approach used in this
proposal can be translated to mimic human parabiosis, which will have significant clinical implications."
10759425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Meiotic recombination is a fundamental genetic and evolutionary process, initiated by the
deliberate infliction of numerous double strand breaks (DSBs) on the genome. In most mammals,
these DSBs are specified by PRDM9, which binds DNA through a zinc finger (ZF) array and
makes two histone modifications that together serve to recruit the DSB machinery. In these
species, the ZF binding affinity is rapidly-evolving. Intriguingly, PRDM9 is not only found in
mammals but throughout vertebrates, and may be directing meiotic recombination there too.
Despite its broad phylogenetic distribution, the gene has been lost independently many times; in
these cases, the determinants of DSB location are less well understood but are associated with
promoter features. We propose four analyses that address these gaps in our understanding: Aim
1. Do non-mammalian species with an intact PRDM9 use it to direct recombination? We will test
this hypothesis in corn snakes, a vertebrate species that carries a complete and rapidly-evolving
PRDM9. We will infer a genetic map from linkage disequilibrium (LD) data as well as by End-
seq, a recently-developed approach to assay meiotic DSB frequencies in the genome. We will also
collect genomic data about salient histone marks, chromatin accessibility and expression levels.
These data will help us to establish if PRDM9 is used to direct recombination. The generality of
our findings will be evaluated by building and examining an LD-based map in a fish species with
an intact PRDM9, the Northern pike. Aim 2. What mechanisms direct the location of DSBs in
species lacking an intact PRDM9? Here, we will focus on two vertebrates: zebra finches, which
(like other birds) lack PRDM9 entirely, and swordtail fish, which lack the two N-terminal
domains. We will combine existing LD-based genetic maps with data that we will collect on DSB
frequencies, salient histone marks, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels. We will then
ask which genomic features influence local recombination rates and if they also play a role in
species with an intact PRDM9. Aim 3. What genes co-evolve with PRDM9? We will test 246
candidate genes for their co-evolution with PRDM9 across the vertebrate phylogeny. As a
byproduct, we will make available a pipeline to identify orthologs of interest. Aim 4. What drives
the evolution of PRDM9 binding? To answer this question, we developed a generative model,
from PRDM9 binding to population dynamics. We will extend our model, notably to characterize
conditions for the loss of PRDM9, and test key predictions with genomic and comparative data.
Thus, we will combine population genetic, phylogenetic and experimental approaches in four vertebrate
species to learn how DSBs are localized in the genome and how and why the mechanism differs among taxa."
10767281,"Mutations in the endosomal-lysosomal regulatory protein VPS45 cause a life-threatening form of severe
congenital neutropenia (SCN) characterized by agranulocytosis, neutrophil dysfunction, platelet alpha granule
deficiency, and myelofibrosis. Normal function of neutrophils and platelets requires formation, mobilization and
fusion of exocytic granules; when dysregulated, these defects lead to an “intracellular traffic jam” in VPS45
neutropenia and other granule disorders. VPS45 regulates the transport and assembly of endosomal-
lysosomal SNARE complexes for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.
We hypothesize that mutant VPS45 protein misregulates SNARE complexes in mammalian hematopoietic
cells, leading to neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction through abnormal intracellular protein trafficking and
granule function. To test this hypothesis, we have developed in vitro and in vivo systems for biochemical and
physiological analysis of SCN caused by VPS45 mutations, including development and initial characterization
of the first mouse model for neutropenia due to an endosomal-lysosomal defect.
Our Specific Aims are: 1. Investigate the biochemical impact of Vps45 mutations on SNARE binding in
vitro and organelle trafficking in yeast. We are quantitatively assessing binding of recombinant wild-type
(wt) and mutant yeast Vps45 and human VPS45 proteins to cognate SNARE proteins and other partners, and
measuring the rates of SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion. We are measuring effects in yeast
on Vps45 and SNARE protein levels, endo- and exocytosis, trafficking of endosomal and vacuolar proteins,
recruitment of Vps45 to membranes, and binding of Vps45 to partner proteins. 2. Determine the molecular
consequences of VPS45 mutations in neutrophils and fibroblasts in vitro. We are testing the “intracellular
traffic jam” hypothesis in mammalian cells by examining the effects of pathogenic VPS45 mutations on SNARE
assembly, membrane trafficking, and granule biogenesis and fusion. 3. Determine the functional
consequences of VPS45 dysfunction in mouse and patient cells. We are investigating whether
abnormalities in membrane trafficking and granule biogenesis lead to defects in the function of mouse and
human cells.. We will focus on pathways leading to apoptosis and to defects in phagocytic function. 4. Test
the physiological consequences of VPS45 dysfunction in our mouse model of VPS45 neutropenia. We
are investigating the effects of VPS45 pathogenic mutations on neutrophil number, bone marrow architecture,
organ pathology, and resistance to infection, in order to help determine how VPS45 dysfunction affects
neutrophil function and host defense in the whole organism.
The proposed collaborative studies, combining the complementary expertise of Drs. Munson and Newburger,
will elucidate previously unexplored molecular mechanisms for the novel SCN caused by VPS45 mutations,
while gaining insights into this and other syndromes caused by vesicle and granule defects."
10764245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women at elevated risk for breast cancer should complete genetic counseling and may require more frequent
screening or additional tests (e.g. breast magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Despite guidelines emphasizing
the importance of genetic counseling as part of the genetic testing process, opportunities to provide genetic
counseling for women at elevated breast cancer risk are often missed. Conventional genetic counseling,
consisting of separate pre- and post-genetic test sessions, is not patient driven, and is labor and time intensive
to meet increasing demand (workforce burden).
Our overall goal is to improve the genetic counseling experience and adherence to the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for women at elevated breast cancer risk. The proposed
randomized controlled trial (RCT) is our next step to reach our goal. A well-established interdisciplinary team
will build on past work to test a novel genetic counseling patient preference (GCPP) intervention integrated
within an electronic health record (EHR) portal that allows patients to indicate their preferences while directly
receiving genetic test report information and post-genetic test counseling. The RCT will be conducted among
1,000 women at elevated risk for breast cancer who agree to participate in the study. Women will be
randomized to: 1) GCPP via EHR patient portal; or 2) conventional genetic counseling.
The efficacy of the GCPP intervention compared to conventional genetic counseling will be determined for:
adherence to NCCN guidelines for having a clinical encounter every 6-12 months and an annual mammogram
(and breast MRI with contrast if recommended) (Aim 1); adherence to additional NCCN recommended cancer
screening (Aim 2); and accurate breast cancer genetic knowledge and perception of breast cancer risk, breast
cancer-specific worry, post-test/counseling distress, and satisfaction with genetic counseling (Aim 3). An
Exploratory Aim will assess patient preferences for receipt of post-genetic test counseling (e.g. in-person,
phone, video-based Skype).
The proposed study is innovative because it will test a novel EHR-based genetic counseling intervention in
a randomized controlled trial. The study is significant because it will determine the efficacy of the GCPP
intervention in a clinical care setting to address many of the limitations of conventional genetic counseling (e.g.
not patient driven). The proposed research is relevant to public health by determining the degree to which a
novel genetic counseling approach influences medical outcomes for women at elevated breast cancer risk. The
study results may change how genetic counseling is delivered to women with elevated breast cancer risk and
address the increasing burden on the genetic counseling workforce."

Grand mal (great malady) seizures, now called generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS), are the most feared
seizures because they can cause death and injury. Repeated GTCSs are the leading risk factor for sudden
unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is a leading cause of death in persons with epilepsy. GTCS also
leads to fractures and soft tissue injuries. It is long known that the motor cortex generates these seizures and
seizures modify the motor cortex. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of seizure-induced
reorganization of the motor cortex have not been studied. Furthermore, it is not known whether a GTCS makes
subsequent seizures more severe. We propose that GTCS enhance the excitability of a subset of motor cortex
pyramidal neurons by enhancing AMPA receptor mediated excitation. We found that GluA1 subunit of the
AMPA receptor was essential for expressing kindling-induced (grade 5) GTCS. We kindled mice lacking the
GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors and their wild-type (WT) littermates using traditional kindling methods.
Whereas WT animals progressed to sustained convulsive GTCS (grade 4 & 5), but knockout animals neither
attained nor sustained GTCS, despite repeated stimulation. Furthermore, two (WT) animals died following
GTCS, while none of the KO animals died. In Aim 1, we propose to characterize the role of the GluA1 subunit
of AMPA receptors in sustaining repeated GTCSs using a combination of conditional knockout mice and
biochemical techniques in intrahippocampal kainate (IHK) and kindling models of TLE. Behavioral seizures
also become more intense when fully kindled animals were stimulated. Much larger volume of the cortex was
active during the 8th GTCS compared to the neocortical activation observed after the 3rd GTCS. Motor cortex
cell counts revealed that many more neurons in the motor cortex expressed c-fos in response to the fifth GTCS
compared to the first GTCS. In Aim 2 experiments, we propose to confirm and expand these findings. we will
compare cortical circuit activity maps and behavioral seizures in response to the first or fifth GTCS in kindling
and IHK TLE models. We compared the electrophysiological properties of motor cortex pyramidal neurons that
expressed c-fos in response to GTCSs with those of surrounding neurons that did not express c-fos and found
surprising differences. Motor cortex pyramidal neurons expressing c-fos were more excitable and
demonstrated enhanced AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory post synaptic currents. In Aim 3, we propose to
compare the excitability and excitatory transmission of layer 2/3 and layer 4/5 pyramidal neurons expressing c-
fos in response to a grade 5 kindled seizure using patch clamp recordings. These studies open a novel area of
epilepsy research, focusing on the effects of GTCS on the neocortex using a combination combine novel,
state-of-the-art techniques."

 Despite advances in therapy, the most aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, remains almost
universally fatal. The first-line therapy for this devastating cancer is maximum feasible surgical resection,
followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy (CRT). It is encouraging that there are
multiple second-line therapies in clinical trials that could improve life quality or prolong survival, such as anti-
angiogenic therapy (AAT). In this scenario, the accurate determination of whether a patient is a responder or a
non-responder at an early stage following CRT has become a significant factor in clinical practice. However,
the limitations in neuroimaging complicate the clinical management of patients and impede efficient testing of
new therapeutics. Even with the improvements in advanced imaging modalities, distinguishing true progression
vs. pseudoprogression (induced by CRT), or response vs. pseudoresponse (induced by AAT) remain two of
the most formidable diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, the current gold standard for diagnosis and local therapy
planning is still based on pathologic appraisal of tissue samples. However, even this yields variable results due
to the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of treatment response. Therefore, reliable imaging tools, capable of early
prediction of the tumor response to clinical therapies, are urgently needed. Amide proton transfer-weighted
(APTw) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-based molecular MRI technique, which
has been demonstrated to add important value to the clinical MRI assessment in neuro-oncology. However,
most currently used imaging protocols are essentially semi-quantitative, and the images obtained are often
called APTw images because of other contributions. Notably, it has been shown that quantitative CEST-MRI is
able to achieve more pure and higher APT signals in patients with brain tumors. On the other hand, deep-
learning is a state-of-the-art imaging analysis technique that provides exciting solutions with minimum human
input. In particular, the saliency maps derived act as a localizer for class-discriminative regions, and may have
great potential to guide biopsies and local treatment regimens. The goals of this proposal are to demonstrate
the potential of quantitative CEST-MRI to resolve two formidable diagnostic dilemmas for GBM patients and to
develop an automated deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. This
application has three specific aims: (1) Implement and optimize the quantitative CEST-MRI technique and
quantify its accuracy in predicting early response to CRT and survival; (2) Determine the capability of
quantitative CEST-MRI to assess the response to bevacizumab; and (3) Develop a deep-learning pipeline that
includes structural and CEST images for responsiveness differentiation and stereotactic biopsy guidance. If
successful, our results—and particularly the deep-learning platform established—will be readily available to
accurately identify early response and guide stereotactic biopsy, thus changing the clinical pathway."

C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo-
men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively
long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This
poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render
up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact
of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual-
ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim-
iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that
disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional
procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion
directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were
shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications
of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven-
tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in-
terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The
following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma-
ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe-
line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma-
ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion
compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res-
piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data
that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial
motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in
animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer
evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform-
able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame-
work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided
radiation therapy."
10752683,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
NMDA-type glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in
the central nervous system (CNS). Seven NMDA receptor subunits have been cloned (GluN1, GluN2A-D, and
GluN3A-B) that assemble into tetrameric receptors. Most NMDA receptors in the CNS are composed of two
GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits, which are intensely investigated and well understood. By contrast, many
properties of GluN3-containing NMDA receptors remain unresolved. In recent years, GluN3-containing NMDA
receptors have been implicated in synapse maturation and synaptic plasticity, and linked to several CNS
disorders. Selective ligands for GluN3-containing receptors are missing, thereby hampering studies of their
roles in neuronal signaling. Structure and function of neuronal GluN3-containing receptors are poorly
understood. Physiological conditions of prolonged exposure to glycine result in accumulation of GluN3-
containing receptors in a strongly desensitized state. The overarching goal of this project is to mitigate these
barriers and guide future studies on neuronal signaling by GluN3-containing NMDA receptors composed of two
GluN1 and two GluN3A subunits. In Aim 1, we will investigate ion channel properties of native GluN3A-
containing receptors. Functional and pharmacological properties of the recently discovered native GluN1/3A
receptors are unknown. We will use electrophysiological recordings to investigate function and pharmacology
of native GluN1/3A receptors in brain slices and recombinant GluN1/3A receptors expressed in HEK cells. This
aim will also investigate physiologically relevant conditions that can enable activation of current responses from
native GluN1/3A receptors. In Aim 2, we develop the molecular pharmacology of GluN3A-containing NMDA
receptors. The discovery of neuronal GluN1/3A receptors strengthens the rationale to develop GluN3A-
selective ligands. We will evaluate novel orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators at GluN1/3A receptors in
order to develop more potent and selective GluN3 ligands. The goal of this aim is to provide lead compounds
and structure-activity relationships that can guide the development of novel GluN3-selective pharmacological
tools. In Aim 3, we will define structural determinants of physiological roles for neuronal GluN3A-containing
receptors. Neuronal GluN3A expression prevents synapse maturation, and neurons in GluN3A-deficient mice
display increased dendritic spine density compared to wild type mice. We will identify the structural (e.g.
receptor domains) and functional features (e.g. agonist binding) of GluN3A-containing NMDA receptors that
mediate changes in spine density and evaluate effects of GluN3A-selective ligands on dendritic spine density."
10753547,"Project Summary / Abstract
Blood vessels, from arteries to capillaries to venules and then to veins, contribute to fundamental physiological
processes. However, the vascular responses for repair and restoration of microvascular networks after cortical
brain injury are poorly understood, including how neuronal activity influences these processes. A major barrier
to research is the poor accessibility of micro-vessels in the brain and associated technical difficulties. To
overcome this barrier, we propose to use innovative imaging technologies that we have co-developed to
investigate micro-vessel formation and re-growth in response to focal cortical injury. We have used light-weight
head-mounted, miniaturized microscopes (“miniscopes”) to dynamically image the vasculature and associated
cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. We will use cortical injury models by applying a controlled
moderate impact to the mouse motor cortex. Combining in vivo longitudinal miniscope and 2-photon imaging,
histological “vessel painting” and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI MRI), we aim to achieve
a deeper understanding of microvascular restoration following cortical injury. We will apply targeted optogenetic
stimulation of excitatory neurons and specific inhibitory neurons to modulate microvascular repair in early and
late phases of vessel re-growth. Our guiding hypothesis is that microvascular restoration and remodeling after
cortical injury are regulated by vascularization sequences and cellular processes that are similarly observed in
normal vasculogenesis during central nervous system development. In Aim 1, we will identify the time course
and spatial pattern of vascular regrowth, and blood flow dynamics after focal cortical injury. Vascular networks
and blood flow are visualized with fluorescent-labeled dextrans for in vivo imaging for quantitative
measurements. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of endothelial cells in new blood vessel sprouting and the
establishment of functional microvascular by imaging Tie2-Cre reporter mice during the first two weeks post-
injury. We will also examine the influence of astrocytes and pericytes in vascular re-growth. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that optogenetic stimulation of specific neuron types in a temporally controlled manner
facilitates and enhances microvasculature restoration for post-injury repair. We will also examine if and how
targeted modulation of neural activities modulate Wnt/ß-catenin and VEGF signaling mechanisms that are critical
for micro-vessel re-growth. Behavioral testing will assess the outcomes of the optogenetic treatment. We have
strong preliminary data that supports the premise for the proposed research for all aims. The proposed research
will advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cortical microvascular
restoration and how neural stimulation enhances vascular network formation."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
Airway disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Gene therapy offers a potential cure for CF.
Among gene delivery vehicles, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have demonstrated success in clinical
trials. AAV vectors have also been tested in CF patients via airway delivery for gene addition but without
measurable success perhaps due to physical airway barriers and inefficient transduction. Studies have shown
that higher AAV transduction of airway epithelial cells occur via the basolateral membrane in vitro and our
preliminary study demonstrated that systemic administration of AAV vectors induced much more efficient lung
transduction than airway delivery in mice. These findings strongly suggest that AAV can transduce airway
epithelial cells via systemic administration. The efficiency of AAV transduction in airway epithelial cells after
systemic delivery of AAV vectors is usually restricted by the blood vascular barrier and a high prevalence of
AAV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). In this proposal, based on our previous studies, we will explore different
strategies to develop novel AAV vectors using directed evolution and AAV virion specific binding peptides via
phage display technology to increase AAV vector vascular permeability for enhanced transduction in airway
epithelial cells and to evade Nabs after systemic administration. Finally, the novel approaches developed in
this proposal will be used to deliver optimized CRISPR/Cas9 specific for CFTR del508 to CF mice and study
the long-term phenotypic correction. The results generated from these studies will allow us to develop an
effective approach to treat CF patients using AAV vector mediated gene delivery.

10758291,"The overarching goal of this application is to investigate the role of sialidase and sialic acid in the keystone
pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and their contributions to the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Sialic acid
(SA), a group of structurally related nine-carbon sugar acids, plays critical roles in host-pathogen interactions.
On the host side, mammalian mucosal surfaces and secretions of the mouth, airway, gut, and vagina are
especially sialoglycan-rich, which have a variety of biological, biophysical, antimicrobial, and immunological
functions. In addition, a number of cell surface receptors (e.g., chemokine-, immunoglobulin-, and toll-like-
receptors) are either sialylated or recognize sialylated ligands, which play critical roles in immune recognition
and activation. On the pathogen side, many bacterial pathogens have evolved different mechanisms to target
host SA for adherence, invasion, immune modulation and nutrient acquisition, thereby promoting their fitness
and pathogenesis. Specifically, bacterial pathogens often use sialidases to hydrolyze host sialoglycans,
compromise host immune defenses, and promote their survival in the mucosal niche. Salivary and gingival
crevicular fluids contain a high concentration of SA bound to sialoglycans in various proteins such as mucins.
Clinical studies indicate that sialidase activity in the oral cavity is positively associated with the severity of
periodontitis; thus, it is recommended as a biomarker for periodontitis diagnosis. Accordingly, sialidases have
been found in numerous oral bacteria including the keystone pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). Pg
lacks genes to synthesize SA. Instead, it encodes a sialidase (PG0352), which is highly conserved among all
genome sequenced Pg isolates. Previous studies from our group and others have shown that PG0352 plays a
crucial role in Pg capsule synthesis, biofilms, stress response, innate immune responses, and virulence.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes remains elusive. In this application, we
hypothesize that Pg employs a sialidase and a SA specific transporter to scavenge host SA, which is in turn
used to modify Pg cell surface molecules such as capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby intercepting
host innate immune defenses, such as complement killing and phagocytosis of neutrophils and macrophage. To
test this hypothesis, the following studies are specifically designed and will be implemented: Aim 1: To delineate
the biochemical and structural features of PG0352 by using an approach of genetics, biochemistry, and
crystallography; Aim 2: To investigate how Pg imports and utilizes SA by using a multidisciplinary approach of
genetics, biochemistry, glycobiology, immunology, and biofilm assays; and Aim 3: To elucidate the role of
PG0352 in the pathogenicity of Pg by using various in vitro and in vivo approaches. Completion of this project
will not only provide mechanistic insights into understanding the role of SA and sialidase in the pathophysiology
of Pg and perhaps other oral pathogens as well, but also will pave a way for future development of specific
sialidase inhibitors against oral pathogens, which can provide alternatives to mitigate periodontal diseases."

Our major goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of local delivery of anti-senescence drugs when used for
immunomodulation at the local cellular level for bone healing. In the immune system, macrophages play a
major role in switching inflammation on or off during healing, and they balance activities of bone-forming and
bone-resorbing cells. We recently reported that a thin layer of biomimetic calcium phosphate could be used in
a novel way as a transient barrier layer (TBL) to sequentially deliver two drugs in a step-wise fashion to switch
macrophage phenotype from pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative. We discovered that macrophages are able
to make holes through the TBL and thereby control delivery timing to a drug below the TBL without release of
drugs into the media. We now propose to apply this TBL technology to improve macrophage transitions
impaired by age as a means to improve bone healing in the elderly. In aging, as well as in metabolic disorders,
the immune response is affected by senescent cells that no longer replicate, but have a senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that produces high levels of proinflammatory molecules. Certain
chemotherapy drugs, known as senolytics, however, kill senescent cells and other drugs, called anti-SASP
drugs, block their pro-inflammatory cell signaling. Both approaches have been shown to enhance bone density
in older mice when given systemically over months, yet both types of anti-senescence drugs have unwanted
side effects, and neither approach has been investigated in bone healing contexts. We now propose using the
TBL on a bone graft substitute to control local delivery timing of either a senolytic or an anti-SASP drug in a
bone microenvironment to maximize calvarial bone repair in old mice. Our preliminary studies support our
hypothesis that delivery timing is critical to improve macrophage switching, osteoblast differentiation, and
scaffold resorption, and restrict osteoclast maturation all required for optimal bone repair. Aim 1 is a
mechanistic in vitro study to understand how appropriately-timed delivery of senolytic ABT-263 or anti-SASP
Rux restores osteogenic communication between osteoblasts, macrophages and osteoclasts from old mice
compared to cells from old humans relative to young controls. We will broadly capture effects of these drugs on
in vitro cell cross-talk by RNAseq. These studies will establish commonalities between human and mouse cell
culture responses to the drugs and establish our model for eventual translation to human subjects. The in vivo
studies of Aim 2 (with ABT-263) and Aim 3 (with Rux) will determine the appropriate dose and timing of anti-
senescence drugs in old mice to suppress senescent cell activity and increase osteoprogenitor
activity/decrease osteoclast activity guided by timely macrophage transitions. Our results will reveal the
fundamentals of timed, local delivery of drugs to modulate macrophage transitions in injured old mice with
heightened inflammation, as well as accelerating the safe and effective implementation of anti-senescence
drugs. This will have dramatic implications for healing in the elderly as well as for obese and diabetic patients."
10755311,"Cerebral microvasculature abnormalities, such as degeneration of the capillary endothelium, are implicated
in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. In addition, ischemic lesions that cause neuronal damage are often found in AD brains. The brain responds to ischemia by stimulating tissue neovascularization via sprouting angiogenesis; impairment of this function renders the brain vulnerable to the insult. It has been hypothesized that decreased angiogenesis in AD leads to insufficient blood flow and neuronal dysfunction in affected areas. The EphB4/ephrinB2 (efnB2) ligand-receptor system is known to regulate brain angiogenesis in response to ischemia. We present evidence that Presnilin1 (PS1), an important factor in familial AD (FAD), regulates angiogenic functions of EphB4/efnB2 such as stimulation of VE-cadherin angiogenic complexes in brain endothelial cells (ECs). We also found that this function is impaired by PS1 FAD mutants. In addition, we found that ischemia stimulates formation of the same angiogenic complexes in the brain and that this function is attenuated by PS1 FAD mutants together with ischemia-induced neovascularization and cerebral blood flow while neuronal death is increased. We also found that PS1 FAD mutants decrease the γ-secretase processing of efnB2 and production of the angiogenic peptide efnB2/CTF2 thus impairing the response of brain ECs to angiogenic factors. Together, our data support the hypothesis that PS1 FAD mutants inhibit ischemia-induced angiogenic functions of ECs by decreasing the γ-secretase processing of efnB2 and impairing the EphB4/efnB2 signaling, thus decreasing neovascularization in the adult brain and leading to increased vulnerability to this toxic insult and neuronal death. In this application we examine the roles of PS1 FAD mutants and γ-secretase on ischemia-induced angiogenic complexes, blood flow, angiogenesis and neuronal death. In addition, we propose to test a small peptide, which derives from the proteolytic processing of efnB2 by γ-secretase and which we found to rescue angiogenic functions of PS1 FAD ECs, for its pro-angiogenic and neuroprotective functions in brains expressing FAD mutants. In addition we aim to search for novel ischemia-induced angiogenic pathways that are impaired by PS1 FAD mutants and examine whether VE-cadherin angiogenic complexes and angiogenic protein expression are impaired in brains of human PS1 FAD and AD patients."

 The patient-clinician interaction is central to most therapies and is supported by key interpersonal
mechanisms of action such as clinician empathy, therapeutic alliance, and trust. However, the neural
underpinnings of this effect are mostly unknown. Our recently published study applied functional MRI (fMRI)
hyperscanning (i.e. simultaneously neuroimaging chronic pain patients and clinicians in synchronized MRI
scanners) demonstrated that brain-to-brain concordance in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is up-regulated
following a clinical interaction and associated with patient analgesia. Our study also found that greater facial
expression mirroring is associated with higher therapeutic alliance and greater evoked pain analgesia.
Interestingly, the TPJ is known to be a key region for theory-of-mind processing (ToM, i.e. mentalizing,
perspective-taking), defined as the ability to infer and understand others’ mental states - a cognitive function
critical for social communication, empathy, and social mirroring. Furthermore, ToM training protocols have
been found to improve mentalizing ability, which can generalize to other cognitive / quality of life functions. We
propose that patient/clinician TPJ concordance, linked with ToM processing, is a key aspect of therapeutic
alliance, and thus ToM training for fibromyalgia patients will increase alliance, facial expression mirroring, and
TPJ concordance, with the latter mediating improvements in pain outcomes following acupuncture therapy, an
established non-pharmacological therapy for chronic pain. Fibromyalgia is a nociplastic chronic pain disorder
showing a deficit in ToM processing, potentially contributing to the difficulties in social functioning
characterizing this condition, and in great need of novel therapies. Our study will evaluate the impact of a novel
multimodal therapy, a type of approach known to improve pain outcomes and recommended by the Institute of
Medicine report for chronic pain management. Our study design will also allow us to evaluate a neural model
supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia wherein combined ToM training and
acupuncture will synergistically target a critical therapeutic pathway - i.e., patient-provider alliance, instantiated
by TPJ concordance. Our Aims will: (1) Determine behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ToM training,
(2) Evaluate the impact of ToM training on brain-to-brain concordance with fMRI hyperscanning, and (3)
Assess if brain/behavioral markers mediate the effect of ToM training on longitudinal acupuncture outcomes."
10745296,"Abstract. UBE3A is a gene that encodes a HECT (Homologous to E6AP C-terminus) domain E3 ubiquitin ligase
linked to numerous developmental and psychiatric disorders. Loss of function of the maternally derived UBE3A
enzyme causes Angelman syndrome whereas gain of function, due to duplication or triplication of UBE3A, is
linked to a broad range of disorders including Dup15q syndrome, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. These
observations strongly suggest that bi-directional changes in UBE3A activity contribute to neuropsychiatric
pathology. However, the mechanisms that regulate UBE3A activity remain poorly understood. The primary goal
of our proposed research is to uncover mechanisms of UBE3A regulation, that when faulty, can lead to aberrant
gain or loss of UBE3A function. In preliminary work, we developed a high-throughput assay to assess the
functional consequence of non-truncating UBE3A missense variants. This screen identified numerous novel
loss of function mutations, as well as gain of function mutations that hyperactivate UBE3A activity well above
wild type (WT) enzyme levels. These results provide deep structure-function information that we can now
leverage to uncover mechanisms of UBE3A regulation. This proposal aims to, 1) create a complete functional
catalogue of known missense variants identified in individuals, 2) utilize structure-function analyses to identify
mechanisms that can lead to both aberrant gain and loss of enzyme function, and 3) leverage biochemical
insights to engineer proteins that can target UBE3A activity. The molecules generated from our work will be
applied to examine whether alteration of UBE3A activity can rescue synaptic phenotypes observed in mice
harboring hyperactivating mutations in UBE3A. If successful, our work will provide new biochemical insights and
tools that will make it possible to target UBE3A for therapeutic intervention in various neuropsychiatric disorders."

 Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major global public health issue. Following mTBI, individuals commonly
report difficulties with hearing quality, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and speech-in-noise intelligibility. In order to
understand why patients experience auditory dysfunction after mTBI, new approaches are needed that combine
quantitative non-invasive biomarkers in mTBI patients with studies of the underlying neurophysiological and
anatomical changes. The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that many of the neurosensory disorders
associated with mTBI share a common root related to a disruption of low-level sensory feature coding. Of all the
sensory systems, the auditory system places the highest demand on rapid, high-fidelity temporal coding. We
therefore propose that abnormal temporal processing and central gain in the auditory system of mTBI patients
and animal models would highlight a neural signature of the auditory behavioral sequalae and may serve as the
“canary in the coal mine” for distributed pathophysiology occurring more generally in other brain systems. Thus,
the Candidate proposes a mentored training plan to develop non-invasive biomarkers of auditory dysfunction in
mTBI subjects and to identify the neurobiological substrates for these deficits in a mouse model of mTBI.
 The Candidate has assembled a mentorship team that has expertise in a range of relevant areas for the
proposal, including psychophysics in human subjects, mTBI mouse models, neurophysiological measures of
auditory temporal processing and central gain, and quantitative cochlear histopathology. By integrating
complementary levels of analysis through the study of different species it will be possible to generate greater
insight into the pathophysiology of mTBI. In Aim 1, the Candidate will use a combination of auditory
psychophysical tests and measures of the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency following response to test
the hypothesis that mTBI subjects show deficits in coding rapid temporal cues and hyperactivity in sound intensity
coding relative to controls. In Aim 2, the Candidate will incorporate a mouse mTBI model to compare EEG
recordings against extracellular recordings of local field potentials and single unit spiking from the inferior
colliculus (IC) and auditory cortex (ACtx) to test whether: 1) mice exhibit a similar auditory temporal processing
and central gain phenotype observed in human subjects, and 2) abnormal temporal processing and coding of
sound intensity are more prevalent in the IC or ACtx. In Aim 3, the Candidate will examine sensory and neural
pathology in the cochlea of mice that have undergone mTBI, as well as transcriptional changes in Gria2 and
Gabra1 mRNA levels in the IC and ACtx. These studies in Aim 3 will address the hypothesis that dysregulation
of auditory temporal processing and central gain are linked to cochlear afferent neuropathy and imbalanced
markers of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the central auditory pathway. The K08 award will be a crucial
stepping-stone toward the goal of developing into an independent clinician-scientist."

Health (also in Boston). Two new CRSs are proposed—a prevention CRS at University of Mississippi Medical
Center in Jackson, MS and a vaccine CRS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston. The
BJP HIV CTU and its component CRSs will function as an integrated, collaborative consortium to coordinate and
implement clinical trials designed by the Leadership Groups of the NIAID-funded HIV/AIDS CTNs. The five
existing CRSs have been extremely effective in conducting studies and contributing substantially to the scientific
agendas of their respective CTNs. Expansion of our existing CTU to include two new CRSs devoted to HIV

UMMC Prevention CRS is located in Jackson, MS a city in the southeastern United States with a predominantly
African American population that ranked 4th highest in HIV infection and 5th highest in the rate of AIDS diagnoses
among US metropolitan areas. The proposed Vaccine CRS within the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research
at BIDMC will engage investigators who have made major and sustained scientific contributions to the HIV
vaccine field over the past 15 years. The BJP HIV CTU will be led by three highly experienced PIs, Drs. Daniel
Kuritzkes, Kenneth Mayer and Lindsey Baden, and will include highly accomplished CRS leaders and
collaborating investigators. The CTU will function as an integrated, highly collaborative consortium that will have
centralized planning, resource allocation, decision-making and financial management through an efficient
administration plan. Centralized resources include a Clinical Research Laboratory, a Research Pharmacy
Coordinator, Data and Quality Management Plans and a Community Engagement Core. The CTU has diverse
and accessible populations for study, representing communities most affected by HIV. Each CRS has well-
grounded connections in the communities in which they are based. The BJP HIV CTU is well-poised to carry out
efficient high-quality clinical trials to address major questions in HIV clinical research. Its leadership and

10747373,"Abstract: This proposal seeks the renewal of the Opportunities in Genomics Research (OGR) Program. Since
2007, the OGR Program has been run out of The McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in Saint
Louis and funded through the NHGRI's Diversity Action Plan. The mission of the OGR Program is to increase
the representation of students from underrepresented groups in genome science or genome science-related PhD
and MD/PhD programs. We seek to accomplish our mission through the effective execution and evolution of
summer undergraduate and academic year post-baccalaureate research programs for students from racial and
ethnic backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and students
with disabilities. Both OGR programs provide trainees with cutting-edge research experiences in genome science
or related fields and 11 other educational activities that seek to train them to think critically and to write and
speak effectively about their research. Workshops and classes are tailored to train students in the core concepts
of genome science, bioinformatics, and scientific presentation. Professional development activities focus on
helping students prepare for and excel in graduate school interviews and graduate school itself.
Over its three funding cycles, student outcomes for the OGR program reveal great momentum. PhD
matriculation of students in our summer program rose from 29% in the first cycle to 50% or above the last two
cycles. More impressively, PhD matriculation of students in our post-baccalaureate program rose from 44% in
the first cycle to 75% in the second cycle and 90% in the current cycle. We expect the implementation of new
and modified activities to solidify and extend these gains. Specifically, new activities will promote integration
among OGR trainees and trainees in the NHGRI T32 PhD Genomic Sciences program, enhance training in
bioinformatics, provide trainees with greater exposure to the diversity of research careers available to PhD
scientists, and initiate community outreach events to under-served area high schools and their students.
Based on the past success and current plans of our program, we seek support for five more years of funding to
continue our mission of enhancing diversity in PhD programs nation-wide. We propose to expand our post-
baccalaureate program to five trainees per year, and with university support, to maintain the size of our summer
undergraduate program at eight students per summer. We believe our programs will continue to help realize the
great scientific and intellectual potential inherent within the diverse population of the United States, much of
which currently lies latent due to the underrepresentation of many sectors of our nation's population within
scientific research in general and genome science in particular."

focus of this proposal is to test directly predictive coding models of speech perception. In predictive coding
hypotheses, the brain minimizes the differences between internally generated expectations and sensory
observations through an ongoing interaction between sensory and higher-order cortical regions.
 We use novel combinations of complementary invasive and non-invasive experimental methods to study
these brain regions in neurosurgery patients who require placement of chronic intracranial electrodes. These
experiments involve combining direct cortical electrophysiological recording methods with non-invasive
electroencephalography, electrical stimulation techniques and anatomical and functional neuroimaging
methods. We also obtain causal evidence of network functional properties by studying the effects of selectively
disrupting the function of specific components of this network. Our investigative strategy makes use of these
unique experimental opportunities to overcome long-standing barriers to progress in this research field.
 We will pursue our goals by testing hypotheses regarding: (1) the locations, functional properties and
connectivity patterns of auditory cortical fields and auditory-related cortices of the temporal and frontal lobes
that are engaged in speech processing, (2) predictive coding models of speech signaling within this network,
and (3) the behavioral consequences and neural signatures of selective disruption of the network.
 These objectives are pursued by an experienced multidisciplinary group of investigators with expertise
encompassing all required clinical and research topic areas. To our knowledge, the resulting data will be the
first of its kind to directly demonstrate how speech information is processed at all levels of auditory cortical
hierarchy and provide causal evidence of the role of feedback projections on speech information processing
within canonical auditory cortex. Detailed characterization of this network will improve our understanding of the
pathophysiology of disease states affecting this system and will provide mechanistic insights that are required
to inform the design of new treatment strategies."
10746768,"Disabling age-related hearing loss (ARHL) afflicts greater than 50% of the population over the age of 70.
The progressive loss of sensory hair cells (HCs) of the cochlea, primarily the outer HCs (OHCs), is either the
cause or the final common pathology of most forms of ARHL. However, the molecular basis of ARHL is
unknown, impeding development of targeted interventions. Furthermore, attempts to reprogram progenitor
cells towards cochlear HC fates result primarily in immature HC-like cells, similar to vestibular HCs. For these
reasons, the study of the molecular pathways underlying OHC differentiation and survival is critical.
 Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of gene expression. When associated with disease,
identifying the upstream regulators and downstream targets of a TF is an effective route to determine
additional key players in the same process. In this competitive renewal we build upon our previous success,
identifying critical roles for the RFX and IKZF2 TFs in OHC differentiation, function and survival, and follow up
with two specific aims designed to elucidate their molecular mechanism within the HC/OHC genetic programs:
 Group 1 RFX TFs (RFX1/2/3), are master regulators of ciliogenesis. However, while OHCs lacking Rfx1/3
die within 12 hours from the onset of hearing, they have normal bundle development. RFX2 is transiently
expressed in the developing HCs, possibly preventing a ciliogenesis defect with loss of Rfx1/3. We therefore
hypothesize that group 1 RFX TFs have a dual role in HC development, with an early role in hair bundle
formation, and later role in terminal differentiation and survival. Specific Aim 1: To identify the mechanisms by
which RFX TFs support embryonic as well as early post-natal cochlear hair cell differentiation.
 IKZF2 is a key regulator of OHC gene expression, precisely regulated to express only in OHCs starting
from P4. We hypothesize that: (1) deletion of IKZF2 target genes will reveal genes essential for OHC function
and survival; (2) IKZF2 is required for maintenance of mature OHCs; and (3) Ikzf2 expression is regulated by a
master-regulator of OHC maturation. Specific Aim 2: To identify the mechanism by which IKZF2 leads to OHC
differentiation, to determine its role in mature OHCs, and to identify its upstream regulatory network.
 To accomplish these aims we combine novel protocols for OHC-specific multi-omic analyses with state-
of-the-art bioinformatics, and characterization of novel mouse models to validate the roles of candidate genes
in hearing. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) impact our understanding of OHC differentiation and
survival; (2) functionally characterize the roles of key RFX and IKZF2 target genes in hearing; (3) result in
transcriptomic and epigenetic maps of differentiating and mature OHCs which will be applied to inform
studies for HC regeneration/identifying candidate genes for ARHL; and (4) generate numerous mouse models
for RFX and IKZF2 target genes, which will be readily available to the scientific community. Additionally, all of
the data generated as part of this proposal will be shared via the gEAR (umgear.org)."
10744197,"The increasing availability of “big data” has transformed the training required to advance our understanding of
the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the identification of patient-level and public health
approaches to prevent its occurrence and aspects of quality of care for patients with CVD and its risk factors.
The goal of the proposed pre-doctoral National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute T32 CVD training grant is to
engage and empower biostatistics and epidemiology students with a strong foundation in both disciplines so
they will be positioned to lead the design, conduct and analysis of the big data that are being collected in the
21st century. Located in the Southeastern US, an area with the highest heart disease death rates, the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has been at the forefront of CVD biostatistics and epidemiology
research for over 25 years. The Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology are internationally recognized
for leading randomized trial coordinating centers, serving as the coordinating center and field sites for
epidemiology studies, conducting analyses of health insurance claims and electronic medical record data, and
developing new methods for statistical genetics/genomics. For this T32 program, we are requesting funding for
a total of 12 pre-doctoral trainees over the course of 5 years including 2 new trainees in each of years 1
through 3 and 3 new trainees in each of years 4 and 5. Trainees enrolled in the T32 program will receive a
strong foundation in the pathophysiology and epidemiology of CVD, skills to design and conduct observational
research, training on rigor and reproducibility in CVD research, familiarity with how real-world data are
collected and analyzed, experience conducting big data analytics including omics data, grant writing
experience, and networking opportunities within UAB and the larger scientific community of CVD researchers.
Pre-doctoral trainees will complete activities that provide added value to their doctoral programs in biostatistics
and epidemiology including didactic cross-training courses, a grant writing class and workshop, research
immersions in three areas of big data, professional development workshops, and CVD seminars and a journal
club. We have designed three workshops for this T32 grant including an 8-week summer training program on
CVD, a high performance computing boot camp and a workshop on team science and communication. The
training program’s capstone experience is a mentored research project resulting in a peer-reviewed
manuscript. The program will be led by Drs. Hemant Tiwari and Paul Muntner, full professors in Biostatistics
and Epidemiology, respectively, with strong mentoring records and program development experience. We
have received the commitment from 14 primary mentors and 11 secondary mentors from the Departments of
Biostatistics and Epidemiology. An additional 21 faculty members from across UAB have committed to serve
as content mentors. The proposed pre-doctoral T32 Training Program will produce a cadre of biostatisticians
and epidemiologists prepared to lead CVD research studies that address the priorities of NHLBI."
10770398,"Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize cancer therapies, by enabling frequent blood-based monitoring of
tumor-derived materials, as cancers evolve in response to therapeutic interventions. Nowhere is this more
evident than in triple negative metastatic breast cancer, where women may undergo multiple serial courses of
therapy over many years, each associated with an initial response, followed by the acquisition of drug
resistance. Plasma DNA (ctDNA) mutation analyses provide a measure of tumor burden and may identify
targetable mutations for small molecule inhibitors, but they do not allow ex vivo culture of intact circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) for individualized preclinical drug sensitivity (“precision oncology”). Isolation of CTCs has
been achieved using small blood volumes (5-10 mL), but these cells are so rare that it has not been feasible to
establish clinically robust ex vivo CTC cultures. Our hypothesis is that we can massively increase the amount of
blood screened through standard clinical leukapheresis (1-2 L), and in return, achieve 100+-fold increase in the
number of isolated CTCs to establish routine ex vivo culture of CTCs. It is also important to note that ex vivo
CTC cultures obtained by sampling 1-2 L blood will reflect the “real time” molecular subtype, genetic
composition, and evolving drug sensitivity profile of an individual patient's metastatic breast cancer, including
multiple lesions that together contribute to the blood-borne CTC population and the patient's overall tumor
burden. We will develop a high-throughput microfluidic technology that achieves highly efficient depletion of
tagged blood cells away from unmanipulated single and clustered CTCs and provides “tumor independent
enrichment” performance, which is applicable to cells disseminated from any solid tumor type without making
any a priori assumption on the physical and/or biological properties of tumor cells. We will also establish the
microenvironmental conditions conducive to high efficiency ex vivo CTC cultures from women with metastatic
triple negative breast cancer. Success would be transformative both for new drug development and for
individualized patient selection among existing therapies for breast cancer patients, and others."
10751041,"Project summary
Congenital heart defects (CHD) constitute the most common type of congenital defect in humans,
however the causes for CHD in most cases are unknown. Lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins are a
complex and poorly characterized class of highly oxidized, polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived bioactive
lipids with key biological activities. We recently found a link between oxylipin signaling, human
cardiovascular development and CHD. This finding is critical not only because of the existing gap in
knowledge, but also because oxylipins are strongly dietary-dependent. Our preliminary data suggests
lipoxygenases and their oxylipin products dramatically modulate cardiogenic mesoderm formation in
human cardiac differentiation model, and their loss leads to CHD in mice. Our central hypothesis is
that endogenous uncharacterized oxylipins are critical regulators of cardiogenic mesoderm specification
and heart morphogenesis through cross-talk with the Wnt signaling pathway. Our objective is to
provide insight into lipoxygenase and oxylipin signaling pathways during cardiac development and
determine their contribution to mechanisms of CHD. Our Specific aims are: (1) Determine the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of oxylipin signaling in human cardiogenic mesoderm specification.
(2) Investigate the role of oxylipins in cardiac extracellular matrix organization in a human stem cell-
derived cardiac organoid model. (3) Evaluate the contribution of oxylipin signaling to congenital heart
defects in mice. Approach: We will study oxylipin function in human pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiogenic mesoderm and in a 3D cardiac organoid model by combining LC-MS lipidomics, cell and
molecular biology and biochemical methods. We will also employ lipoxygenase knockout mice and
oxylipin dietary restriction to study oxylipins in cardiac development in vivo in mouse embryos.
Significance: This work addresses a major gap in knowledge by exploring the biological roles of
oxylipins in cardiac development, and mechanisms underlying their newly discovered links to CHD. We
also offer a novel potential link between diet and congenital heart defects with significant implications
for CHD prevention. Finally, we offer the potential to discover new therapies for treatment by identifying
druggable targets and signaling networks. Innovation: We will explore for the first time the key
molecular mechanisms linking lipoxygenases, oxylipins and cardiac development signaling networks in
human and mouse tissues. We will also establish a new model of cardiac development that integrates
the role of these environmental lipids with developmental molecular networks. Impact: This project will
dramatically expand knowledge of oxylipin biology in cardiac development, help develop strategies to
prevent and potentially treat CHD, and develop new tools for the study of oxylipins in human biology."
10746133,"Project Summary
This proposal is for a long-term and flexible research program designed to obtain key insights into the biology
of learning and memory. Although flexibility is inherent in its design, such that novel observations made over
the course of the research can and will be pursued without delay, the program is grounded in three major lines
of research: (1) the molecular, cellular, and systems neuroscience that underlie the process of active
forgetting, (2) the logic by which the brain organizes different types of olfactory memories among its
component neurons, and (3) the identification and characterization of protein-coding and microRNA genes that
function to suppress the process of memory formation. The active forgetting component stems from the recent
identification of a signaling system that removes previously formed memories and is modulated by internal
states of arousal and sleep, and by external sensory stimulation. This represents an unstudied area in the
neuroscience of memory formation and offers tremendous opportunities for discovery in the molecular biology
and systems neuroscience of the process. The second component is founded on innovative discoveries that
allow the visualization of cellular memory traces – changes in the response properties of neurons due to
learning – that offer a window into the logic behind how memories are organized in the brain. This component
contrasts, as one example, how the brain organizes olfactory memories learned in association with a rewarding
cue and those learned in association with an aversive cue, and delves into the underlying mechanisms. The
third component derives from recent genetic screens that have provided a plethora of new genes, both protein-
coding and microRNA-coding, which enhance memory when suppressed, thus representing new memory
suppressor genes. The proposed behavioral, functional cellular imaging, and molecular genetic experiments
will dissect the roles for these genes in different temporal forms of memory: short-, intermediate-, and long-
term memory; as well as different operational phases of memory formation: acquisition, memory stability, or
forgetting. The results will offer an unprecedented view of the constraints the brain uses to limit memory
formation. There is a rich medical importance to this research given the well-documented problems of cognition
associated with numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders."
10771154,"For a substantial proportion of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, islet autoimmunity plays an important role in disease onset, risk of complications, and progression to pancreatic β-cell failure. However, advances in understanding the heterogeneity within type 2 diabetes have not yet been harnessed to improve clinical diabetes care. In this proposal, we will use state-of-the-art assays and novel statistical techniques in Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes), a well-characterized longitudinal cohort in order to develop a precision medicine approach to islet autoimmunity in type 2 diabetes care.  We will measure islet autoantibody assays currently available for clinical use (antibodies to GAD65, insulinoma antigen 2, and zinc transporter 8), and novel assays that are critical for determining clinical significance and could be widely available in the near future. Novel assays include the GAD65 antibody epitope specificity and IgG subclass, which are key determinants of immunologic activity. We will also measure an antibody to novel epitopes of insulinoma antigen 2 which has been shown to greatly expand its sensitivity and improve diabetes classification. With these rich islet autoantibody data, we will be able to identify patterns of islet autoimmunity that more accurately predict a patient’s diabetes phenotype than traditional measures.  We will accomplish this in Look AHEAD, a U.S.-based randomized trial investigated the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention versus self-directed care among 5,145 overweight/obese adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants have been followed for >15 years with detailed longitudinal ascertainment of clinical and laboratory data, diabetes complications, and mortality. Our pilot data has identified a 6.4% prevalence of traditional islet autoantibodies and associations with mortality and other outcomes. Informed by our work in precision medicine for other disease models, we will use advanced statistical techniques and interactive visualizations to develop a platform for clinicians to interpret the significance of islet autoimmunity. Bayesian hierarchical models will jointly estimate patterns of autoimmunity and associations with a patient’s health trajectory, and we will develop a visualization tool to present these predictions for clinicians. We have developed such visualization tools for prostate cancer, scleroderma, and other disease states which are currently implemented in Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine Centers of Excellence.  Our specific aims are: Aim 1) To identify, among Look AHEAD participants, islet autoantibody signatures (patterns of antibody positivity, epitope specificity, titer, and IgG subclass) and determine their association and clustering with clinical features; Aim 2) Determine the impact of islet autoimmunity on outcomes; and Aim 3) To develop clinically useful a data visualization to display these findings to clinicians. Through these aims, we will achieve our overall goal to advance the epidemiologic knowledge and statistical tools for understanding islet autoimmunity in type 2 diabetes so that it can be used for precision diabetes care."
10836975,"Discovery and development of artificial nucleic acid ligands to probe cellular interactions
The regulation followed by measurement of cellular events, such as intercellular communication, receptor-
ligand interactions, and inter-receptor interactions using molecular tools, will expand our understanding of
cellular decision-making mediated by cell surface receptors. Owing to their synthetic nature and compatibility
with a variety of nano-materials, nucleic acid aptamers are well suited as specific recognition probes for
incorporation into such tools. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA/RNA/XNA (X= nonstandard nucleic acid
base) sequences that bind to a specific target with high affinity and specificity. However, because of their low
solubility in aqueous media, purified cell-surface receptors do not make good targets for in vitro screening of
aptamer ligands. Additionally, in response to ligand binding, cell surface receptors act in concert, forming
transient complexes. Such complexes are hard to constitute in artificial buffer systems while maintaining their
native fold. This means that conventional approaches to aptamer-ligand screening may not lead to aptamers
that are translatable. Addressing this need, the Mallikaratchy Lab recently pioneered a technology termed
Ligand-guided Selection or LIGS to identify functional aptamers from a SELEX (Systematic Evolution of
Ligands by EXponential enrichment) library, against known multi-domain cell surface targets in their native
functional state. LIGS uses the same combinatorial library but takes advantage of characteristics inherent to
SELEX. For example, it is known that the iterative process in conventional SELEX is designed to outcompete
low-affinity binders through a competitive process whereby high-affinity binders move through an increasingly
selective process. LIGS exploits this competition between weak and strong binders in a combinatorial library by
introducing a stronger, known high-affinity secondary ligand, e.g., a monoclonal antibody (mAb), against the
target of interest to outcompete and replace highly specific aptamers. These aptamers can recognize their
target receptors in cultured and clinical samples specifically. Building on our initial work on LIGS, the first goal
of this MIRA is to extend the types of interactions utilized in LIGS to naturally induced conformational switches
of membrane proteins of mechanistic/functional interest to discover artificial ligands based on aptamers against
them. The second goal explores chemical interventions to understand aptamer folding using bioorthogonal
approaches, such as click-chemistry, to facilitate proximity mediated intra-molecular cross-linking. Additionally,
we plan to engineer functional aptamer scaffolds to regulate cell-cell and receptor-ligand interactions using
aptamers already identified using LIGS, explicitly focusing on the modulation of TCR-CD3ε in T-cells. A
successful outcome to these goals will result in aptamers able to probe receptor interactions along with
integrated nano-materials enhancing the application of aptamers in biomedicine while providing insights into
the modulation of cell receptor biology in cellular decision making."
10778548,"Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to
inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column,
increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we
currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in
autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction
in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function.
Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading
to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett
syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally
implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and
others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level”
sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive
effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex.
Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and
connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication
mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the
cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning
techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in
computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated
“in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop.
Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of
autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and
E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in
computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4)
develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the
future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied."
11074149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adolescent substance abuse (SA) has been called America’s #1 public health problem, affecting as many
as 16% of all youth under age 18 and often resulting in serious consequences such as criminal involvement,
health problems, and suicide. Given that adolescent SA is associated with high rates of comorbidity with
mental health (MH) problems and increased suicide risk, integrated SA-MH treatment involving cognitive-
behavioral and family therapy-based approaches, as well as early intervention, is critical. Yet few adolescents
receive any treatment for SA, and unmet needs for services are likely to increase following COVID-19-related
stressors, which disproportionately affected Black, Indigenous, and other youth of color. Developing culturally-
appropriate mobile app technology to effectively address adolescent SA, MH symptoms, and suicide risk,
delivering it in novel universal settings, and using direct-to-consumer and family peer support specialist
techniques could potentially have a large-scale and highly cost-effective public health impact.
 iKinnect is a paired mobile app platform that supports parents (in delivering) and youth (in receiving)
evidence-based practices to reduce youth problem behaviors. Based on Multisystemic Therapy principles,
iKinnect1.0 was originally designed to help youth with serious conduct problems. Results from a randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N=72) demonstrated its efficacy in reducing externalizing behaviors and improving
parenting effectiveness in youth with serious conduct disorder. iKinnect is currently being adapted for more
severely disordered suicidal youth involved in the juvenile justice system as well as their parents. We now seek
to significantly adapt iKinnect for use with a general population of teens with problematic substance use and
their parents to reduce SA, its harmful effects, opioid overdoses, and progression to substance use disorders,
as well as other behavioral health problems that are exacerbated by SA and/or interfere with SA treatment.
 This 34-month fast track seeks to address SA and co-occurring MH problems in teens by significantly
adapting iKinnect to deliver evidence-based SA and MH interventions to general-population youth engaging in
SA. We will pursue regulatory pathways for iKinnect-SA as a mobile medical device to achieve Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval by the project’s end to pave the way for successful Phase III commercialization.
The proposal is defined by three project stages which include: (1) a proof-of-concept formative
evaluation stage where we will iteratively design, test, and build a prototype (Phase I; Months 1-10); (2)
a product design-and-build formative evaluation stage, where we will design, build, and test all remaining
features and apps (Phase II; Months 11-22); and (3) a summative evaluation stage involving a pilot test
(N=25 dyads) and a RCT (N=300 dyads) comparing iKinnect-SA to an enhanced condition that combines
iKinnect-SA with Peer Support Specialists and an active control condition app (Phase II; Months 23-34)."
10757380,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY: Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The 2018
global cancer statistics report indicates an estimated over 1,000,000 new cases and an estimated 783,000
deaths in 2018. Gastric cancers are poorly responsive to therapy and have an unfavorable outcome with an
estimated overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%. In response to genotoxic stimuli, cancer cells
undergo rewiring and reprogramming of transcription and signaling networks to drive adaption and survival
properties. This reprogramming leads to the development of acquired adaptive properties that promote survival
and expansion of neoplastic cells. Comprehensive analysis approaches have enabled us to identify a biologically
relevant novel signaling axis in gastric cancer. We detected aberrant cytosolic overexpression of CDK1 in human
and mouse gastric cancers. While CDK1 is a well-established cell cycle regulator, we have discovered previously
unreported functions in neoplastic cells in gastric cancer, the focus of this proposal. We found that in response
to genotoxic stimuli, such as infection and chemotherapeutics, the surviving pool of neoplastic cells develop an
acquired adaptive pro-survival response that includes induction of CDK1 and SOX9 transcription factor. We
demonstrate, for the first time, that CDK1 is induced in response to activation of NF-kB transcription activity. At
the same time, CDK1 induces SOX9 through epigenetic mechanisms that include activation of DNMT1 and
suppression of miR-145. Inhibition of CDK1 by genetic or pharmacologic approaches decreased SOX9 level and
activity and induced cancer cell death. Based on novel preliminary results, we hypothesize that activation of
CDK1-SOX9 axis promotes cell survival and expansion of neoplastic cells in response to H. pylori infection and
chemotherapeutic interventions. We have developed three specific aims that include mechanistic, functional,
and translational studies using in vitro models, organoid cultures, mouse models, and de-identified human tissue
samples. In aim 1, we plan to investigate the role of H. pylori infection and NF-kB transcription factor in regulating
CDK1-SOX9 axis. We will also investigate a novel epigenetic link that includes CDK1 and DNMT1 in regulating
SOX9 transcription factor levels and activity. Our second aim will focus on investigating molecular functions and
oncogenic transcription network of CDK1-SOX9 axis. The translational significance will be studied in aim 3 by
investigating therapeutic potential and clinical significance of CDK1-SOX9 functional axis in gastric cancer. We
have assembled a highly collaborative team with experience in advanced molecular technologies, cancer
models, and oncology making us in a unique position to perform the proposed studies. Upon completion of this
work, we expect to unveil a novel druggable paradigm of cross-talk between CDK1 and SOX9 signaling pathways
in gastric tumorigenesis. These molecular interactions not only provide a novel understanding of the biology of
gastric cancer but also offer future translational opportunities for the design of new therapeutic interventions for
gastric cancer."
10763008,"Cooperative catalysis or catalysis involving metal-ligand cooperation is a highly versatile approach in
catalysis that have resulted in a myriad of highly efficient synthetic methods and conferred exceptional value to
chemical synthesis of bioactive and/or pharmaceutical compounds. Despite extraordinary advances on this
research topic, there are still much need to develop new cooperative systems based on unique ligand designs to
enable the development of new and/or much improved synthetic methods for chemical synthesis.
 In 2014, the PI initiated a program on the development of bifunctional biaryl-2-ylphosphine ligands that are
designed to enable cooperative gold(I) catalysis. These ligands feature remote basic groups that can engage
bonding interactions with substrates or reagents during catalysis and thereby achieve ligand-metal cooperation.
Several preliminary studies, including a ppm-level gold-catalyzed addition of carboxylic acid to alkyne, an
asymmetric isomerization of alkyne into allene, and trapping of catalytically generated σ-allenylgold
intermediate with aldehyde, have validated the ligand design and the cooperative nature of the catalysis.
 As the major focus of the PI’s future effort, this proposal seeks to apply this cooperative gold(I) catalysis
strategy to the development of asymmetric transformations of exceptional synthetic values. These include
expedient construction of chiral butenolids and 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolines and asymmetric propargylation
reactions/propargylic C-H functionalizations. The extension of this strategy to much cheaper cooperative Cu(I)
and Ag(I) catalysis offers new and distinct opportunities in asymmetric enolate protonation, which would open
valuable access to various carbonyl products. The transition to functionalized N,N-bidentate ligands would
enable the application of the cooperative ligand design concept to a much broader range of metal catalysis and
offer unprecedented opportunities to manipulate carbonyl compounds in asymmetric manners.
 This proposal, if implemented, would introduce a range of new and versatile chiral bifunctional ligands to
metal catalysis and inspire increasing research effort in cooperative catalysis. Moreover, the methods developed
would provide efficient access to a variety of chiral structures of high value to chemical synthesis in general and
pharmaceutical R&D in particular."
10764286,"When the self-management demands of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension exceed patients’
self-management capacity, poor control ensues. For many patients, clinic-based chronic disease care provides
insufficient self-management support, resulting in clinic-refractory chronic diseases. As an example, 12% of all
patients with type 2 diabetes maintain a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8.5% for ≥1 year despite clinic-based care;
this is defined as ‘persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus’ (PPDM). PPDM does not respond to clinic-
based care because the factors that underlie PPDM are not well-addressed with the infrequent patient-provider
contact achievable in clinic. Importantly, over 85% of patients with PPDM have comorbid hypertension, which
further exacerbates outcomes in this high-risk group. Without better treatment options, patients with PPDM and
hypertension will inevitably accrue preventable complications and costs.
 Telehealth has the potential to improve management of clinic-refractory chronic diseases relative to clinic-
based care alone because it facilitates patient-provider contact and better supports self-management. Our prior
work shows that nurse-delivered telehealth interventions incorporating telemonitoring, self-management
support, and medication management can lower HbA1c even among clinic-refractory patients with PPDM.
Excitingly, emerging mobile monitoring technologies could enhance telehealth for clinic-refractory chronic
diseases, either by generating multiple streams of health data to facilitate patient self-management, or by
integrating mobile monitoring data into a nurse-delivered telehealth intervention. However, key evidence gaps
currently prevent use of mobile monitoring-enabled telehealth in clinical practice.
 The current proposal, EXpanding Technology-Enabled, Nurse-Delivered Chronic Disease Care (EXTEND)
seeks to address current barriers and evidence gaps preventing practical use of mobile monitoring-enabled
telehealth for clinic-refractory chronic disease, using PPDM with comorbid hypertension as the target condition.
Because this population has already proven refractory to usual clinic care, this study proposes an active
comparator randomized trial (N=220) comparing the effectiveness of two 12-month telehealth interventions: 1)
EXTEND-Monitoring, or mobile monitoring alone; and 2) EXTEND-Nursing, a nurse-delivered intervention
incorporating mobile monitoring, self-management support, and medication management. In order to guide
further scaling and dissemination of the EXTEND interventions, a rigorous, multi-method evaluation will: (A)
interview stakeholders regarding implementation barriers and facilitators; and (B) compare intervention costs
against potential reimbursement mechanisms. Finally, the value of combining data from mobile monitoring and
electronic health records to predict patient safety events will be examined in the cohort over 24 months.
 Clinic-refractory chronic diseases demand innovation to reduce preventable complications. This high-
impact proposal will address an urgent clinical problem in a manner that is generalizable to other conditions."
10766843,"Project Summary
Despite advances in treatment strategies, xerostomia (or dry mouth) remains a permanent and devastating side
effect of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, reducing the quality of life for ~50,000 cancer patients each
year in the U.S. We aim to develop tissue-engineering approaches to restore salivary function. We have isolated
human salivary gland stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) from patients prior to radiotherapy. We have created
tunable hydrogel matrices that maintain the progenitor status, induce lineage-specific differentiation and promote
the development of organized multicellular spheroids from dispersed hS/PCs. Separately, we have engineered
salivary gland microtissues that exhibit coordinated calcium activation between hS/PC-derived acini-like core
and the surrounding myoepithelial cells. However, a functional gland with extensive branching, polarized acini,
and interconnected ducts has not yet been realized. Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to establish
functional salivary glands using multicellular assemblies of defined shape, geometry and composition. We will
synthesize hydrogel scaffolds that recapitulate key features of the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix
in the developing organ. We will reconstitute the vascular, neural and mesenchymal components in the
engineered environment to foster tissue morphogenesis in vitro and to maintain tissue homeostasis in vivo. In
Aim 1, we will exploit tetrazine ligation, the bioorthogonal and highly efficient cycloaddition reaction between s-
tetrazine and strained alkenes, for the establishment of cell-instructive matrices. We will adapt our established
methods to generate microgels containing sequestered acetylcholine analog, carbachol (CCh). In Aim 2, we will
employ non-adhesive hydrogel microwells to produce multicellular epithelial assemblies consisting of hS/PCs
and CCh depots. The resultant microtissue will be encased in a synthetic basement membrane with bioactive
peptides to stimulate the development of proacrinar progenitor phenotype. We will generate endothelial
microtissues consisting of a core of human salivary gland endothelial cells (hSECs) and a shell of human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We will co-culture the epithelial and endothelial microtissues in a synthetic
extracellular matrix with defined cell-guidance cues to aid in the establishment of a hierarchically integrated
tissue assembly. In Aim 3, the engineered gland with integrated microvasculature and conjugated neurotrophic
factor, neurturin, will be implanted in the resected parotid bed of athymic rats. Enzymatically triggered release of
neurturin will promote implant innervation. Tissue ultrastructure, biomarker expression, gland morphology,
biointegration and function will be assessed under various construct configurations. We will interrogate how the
engineered microenvironments stimulate differentiation, trigger polarization and promote branching. The overall
hypothesis is that hS/PCs co-cultured with hSECs/hMSCs in 3D synthetic matrices displaying biochemical,
geometrical and mechanical cues identified from the native organs will assemble into functional salivary tissues.
Our investigations will help define bioengineering approaches toward the management of xerostomia."

A reflex arising from contracting hind limb skeletal muscles is an important neural mechanism that is
responsible for causing the cardiovascular adjustments to exercise. These adjustments, which include
increases in peripheral vascular resistance, cardiac contractility and rate, function to increase arterial blood
flow and oxygen to the exercising muscles, and in turn support their ability to contract. This neural mechanism
has been named the exercise pressor reflex and its afferent arm is comprised of group III and IV fibers whose
endings are located in and near the muscle interstitium. In patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) the
exercise pressor reflex is exaggerated. The overall goal of the experiments proposed in this application is to
shed light on the role played by lactic acid in evoking the exercise pressor reflex in both health and simulated
peripheral artery disease. The proposed experiments will pay particular attention to Acid Sensing Ion Channels
(ASIC) and will focus on the role that they play in evoking the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in PAD.
Lactic acid, produced by contracting skeletal muscles is believed to stimulate group III and IV afferents,
signaling the spinal cord and brainstem that the arterial blood supply to working muscle is not meeting its
metabolic demand. In the proposed experiments, we will pay particular attention to two important ASIC
isoforms, namely ASIC1a and ASIC3. We will examine in decerebrated unanesthetized rats the responses to
contraction of group III and IV muscle afferents both before and after either pharmacological blockade of the
above receptors or after they have been “knocked down” with siRNA. The proposed experiments will also
examine the responses to contraction of these afferents before and after knockdown of myophosphorylase in
the triceps surae muscles. In addition the responses of group III and IV afferents to contraction in mutant rats
whose ASIC3 has been functionally inactivated by CRISPR Cas 9 technology will be determined. The
proposed experiments will be performed both in rats with freely perfused femoral arteries and in rats with
femoral arteries that have been ligated for 72 hours before the start of the experiment. The latter preparation
simulates the arterial blood flow patterns seen in patients with PAD and therefore serves as a useful animal
model of this disease. The proposed experiments are anticipated to provide new information about metabolic
factors that cause the exercise pressor reflex to be exaggerated in PAD."

 Excess lipids increase the total intramyocellular lipid content and the ectopic fat storage resulting in
lipotoxicity and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles, which is one of the main targets of insulin and its action
is central for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Consumption of a diet high in fat and refined sugars, a
Western Diet (WD), activates mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) to induce muscle lipid metabolic disorders and
insulin resistance. Recent data further indicate that cell specific endothelial cell (EC) MR (ECMR) activation
mediates WD-induced muscle lipid metabolism disorders, impaired insulin metabolic signaling, and tissue
insulin resistance. In this regard, ECMR activation increase CD36 expression in skeletal muscle arterioles and
tissues, which promotes excessive free fatty acid trafficking across the muscle vasculature, leading to skeletal
muscle lipid accumulation, CD36 palmitoylation and insulin resistance. There is a relationship between
microvascular endothelial dysfunction and muscle metabolic disorders and insulin resistance through
exosomes. Recent data suggest that EC derived exosomal proteins, such as exosomal CD36, can promote
lipid accumulation and metabolic disorders. Upon being released from ECs, exosomal CD36 can be up-taken
by the neighboring skeletal muscle and thus promote muscle lipid accumulation. The hypothesis of this
application is that activation of ECMRs induces EC CD36 expression and release of EC-derived
exosomal CD36 which increases free fatty acid uptake in ECs and translocation to skeletal muscle
cells, leading to skeletal muscle intramyocellular lipid deposits and insulin resistance. Objective 1 of
this application is to understand the role and mechanisms of ECMR signaling on CD36 expression, free fatty
acid uptake in ECs and skeletal muscle cells, and related muscle lipid deposition and insulin resistance.
Objective 2 of this application is to investigate the role and mechanisms of enhanced ECMR signaling on the
EC-derived exosomal CD36 release and its role in facilitating increased skeletal muscle cell CD36 to further
promote muscle fatty acid uptake, IMC lipid deposition and insulin resistance. Accordingly, in vitro cell treated
with free fatty acid and in vivo mice fed a WD will be used to set up a model of ECMR/ECCD36 activation,
obesity and insulin resistance. The proposed work should provide a better understanding the role of ECMRs
and EC exosomal CD36 in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance and provide an important
biomarker for the early diagnosis and prevention of this increasing cause of diabetes."

Functional reconstitution of membrane proteins has been the major roadblock for the application of NMR and
other biophysical techniques to investigate their high-resolution dynamic structures in a native membrane
environment. In this application, we propose to develop approaches to enable high-resolution structural studies
of membrane proteins and protein-protein complexes by a variety of biophysical techniques. We will develop
nanodisc technology for detergent-free direct extraction and functional reconstitution of membrane proteins for
structural studies of a variety of membrane proteins including single-pass transmembrane proteins (such as
mammalian cytochromes and heme oxygenase) and integral membrane proteins (including GPCRs and
Guanidine exporter). Synthetic polymers developed in our laboratory exhibit the ability to form nanodiscs with
easily controllable sizes (from ~8 to ~60 nm diameter), are stable against pH and divalent metal ions and capable
of directly extracting membrane proteins. Our preliminary results demonstrate that these nanodiscs (<20 nm
diameter) and macro-nanodiscs (>20 nm diameter) represent an exciting system for solution and solid-state
NMR studies of membrane proteins.
 We also propose to use the newly developed nanodisc technology and NMR approaches to investigate
the structural interactions of mammalian cytochrome-P450 (P450) with its redox partners (P450-reductase (CPR)
and cytochrome-b5 (b5)) to better understand how redox partners regulate P450 catalysis and how P450s
metabolize chemically diverse substrates. The structural aspects pertaining to the catalytic activity of P450s
continue to remain elusive due to a lack of high-resolution structures in their full-length, active forms. Presently,
structural studies of P450s are restricted to various truncated mammalian and water-soluble bacterial P450
homologs. In this study, we will investigate the structure, dynamics and transmembrane domain orientation of
full-length mammalian P450s (2B4, 3A4 and 3A5 isoforms) alone and in complex with its redox partner b5 and
CPR, incorporated in nanodiscs, using a combination of high-resolution solution and solid-state NMR techniques.
We will also investigate the ternary P450-b5-CPR complex in nanodiscs in the presence of substrates to
elucidate the molecular origin of the strikingly different effects CPR and b5 have on P450 2B4 catalysis. The
outcome of the proposed studies on P450-redox complexes will provide structure and dynamics/function
principles regulating P450 metabolism of a wide variety of substrates. The results obtained from this study will
also be useful to design potent drugs to ultimately treat and prevent diseases including cancer."

 Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that is induced by excessive lipid
peroxidation. Previous studies by us and others identified ferroptosis as a natural tumor suppression mechanism
and showed that ferroptosis inactivation, like apoptosis inactivation, contributes to tumor development. Recently,
we and others also showed that radiotherapy (RT) can potently induce ferroptosis and suggested that ferroptosis
inducers (FINs) can be used in RT to overcome radioresistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of
ferroptosis in radioresistance and the exact cancer or genetic contexts in which to target ferroptosis in RT still
remain largely unexplored. This application aims to determine the mechanisms by which ferroptosis inactivation
contributes to radioresistance in KEAP1-mutant lung cancer cells and to assess the combination of RT and FINs
in treating KEAP1-mutant lung cancers. KEAP1 is commonly mutated in lung cancer, and KEAP1-mutant lung
cancers are resistant to RT. KEAP1 mutation or deficiency in lung cancer stabilizes NRF2 and promotes an
NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Our recent publication and new preliminary data support our central
hypotheses that (i) KEAP1 deficiency promotes radioresistance largely through inhibiting ferroptosis, and KEAP1
regulates ferroptosis through NRF2 transcriptional targets SLC7A11 and other unidentified downstream targets;
and (ii) combining RT and FINs that inactivate SLC7A11 (or other potential ferroptosis inhibitors identified from
our studies) is an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome radioresistance in KEAP1-mutant lung cancers
without causing significant damage in normal tissues. To test our hypotheses, we will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which KEAP1 regulates ferroptosis and
radioresistance in lung cancer cells. Specific Aim 2. To determine the effectiveness of combining FINs with RT
for treating KEAP1-mutant lung cancer. Our proposed studies are expected to identify novel mechanisms of
ferroptosis and radioresistance and to identify effective new therapeutic strategies to overcome radioresistance
in lung cancer treatment. Our proposed studies will have a significant impact on both our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of ferroptosis and radiation biology and our ability to target ferroptosis-related
radioresistance in cancer treatment."

Control of the internal organization of cells is essential to the form and function of all organisms. This ability
rests largely on an intricate protein filament network called the cytoskeleton which serves as a scaffolding
structure to pattern cellular contents in space and time. Unlike human-made scaffolding structures, the
cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and is able to change its configuration in response to developmental and
environmental signals, allowing cells to adapt to changing conditions. Thus, the cytoskeleton is like an ever-
changing structural “diagram”, and the goal of my research program is to understand how these diagrams are
generated to execute essential cellular activities that underlie growth, development and physiology.
 Our research focuses on mechanisms for the creation, maintenance and restructuring of the
microtubule cytoskeleton using the cortical microtubule array of Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimentally
tractable system. We use a multidisciplinary approach and benefit from an extensive network of close
collaborators with whom we freely share reagents and ideas. These advantages have allowed us to address
previously intractable questions about cytoskeleton structure and function. Here, we will build on our recent
progress to focus on four major goals: Goal 1) characterize new regulatory mechanisms that specifically tune
the microtubule severing activity of katanin to uncover how various internal and external signals influence the
assembly and disassembly of diverse microtubule structures through katanin. Goal 2) elucidate the structural
dynamics that determine the functional diversity of MAP65 microtubule crosslinking proteins to gain insight into
how evolution selected particular MAP65 sequences for specialized functions and to enable the creation of
new tools to manipulate microtubule function in plants and animals. Goal 3) uncover the structure and
mechanism of action of a new class of microtubule minus-end regulators to understand how TOG domains,
which are typically associated with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins, have been repurposed to recognize
and stabilize microtubule minus-ends. Goal 4) develop a new microfluidics chip platform to analyze the
complex relationships between sets of microtubule regulatory proteins to obtain a clear and integrated picture
of how concurrent molecular activities dynamically pattern microtubule structures. Together, these synergistic
projects will provide a mechanistically detailed picture of the inner workings of complex microtubule structures
and advance our understanding of their functions in cell biology and disease."
10747307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a group of devastating early-onset retinal dystrophies affecting
roughly 1/50,000 to 1/33,000 newborns. LCA-associated variants in the CRX gene result in a severe autosomal
dominant form of the disease, for which no effective treatments are currently available. Importantly, both mouse
and human studies suggest that haploinsufficiency is not responsible for disease manifestation in dominant CRX-
associated LCA, and one copy of wildtype CRX is enough to allow for mostly normal photoreceptor maturation
and function. Despite substantial progress being made in the field, there is a critical need to uncover
pathophysiology and establish reliable treatment options for CRX-associated LCA. The overall goal of this
proposal is to bring together two major unsolved problems in vision research: (1) the ability to accurately
recapitulate dominant LCA in a scalable in vitro model system to study variant-specific disease mechanisms,
and (2) the ability to efficiently and specifically eliminate dominant disease alleles, leaving healthy alleles to
restore photoreceptor cell function.
 In Aim 1, we will develop and characterize iPSC-based disease models from two different dominant
variants of CRX. We will validate disease phenotypes using retinal organoids. In Aim 2, variant-specific disease
mechanisms responsible for the onset of LCA will be examined by generating a retinal organoid model system
from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. In Aim 3, mutant CRX alleles will be inactivated with CRISPR
tools within the human retinal organoid model to study rescue of disease phenotypes. Completion of this aim will
provide the field with a proof-of-concept study for the development of patient-specific CRISPR-based therapeutic
strategies.
 Taken together, the proposed studies will contribute to our basic understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms underlying photoreceptor dysfunction in dominant CRX-associated LCA, and will enable the
development of targeted gene therapies to treat affected individuals."
10754518,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term objectives of this project are to increase our understanding of eukaryotic transcription
elongation, with a focus on histone chaperones. Histone chaperones control the assembly and disassembly of
nucleosomes during transcription, replication, and repair. The proposed experiments address the conserved
histone chaperone Spt6, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model system. Spt6 is conserved
and its human counterpart has been implicated in developmental control and in cancer. Previous analysis of
Spt6 has demonstrated that it is broadly required for transcription and chromatin structure in both yeast and
mammalian cells. While it is established that Spt6 interacts with histones, RNA polymerase II, and other
proteins, the mechanisms by which it functions are unknown. The proposed experiments in Specific Aim 1 will
address the interactions of Spt6 with two other essential and conserved histone chaperones, Spn1/Iws1 and
FACT. Preliminary studies have shown that an spt6 mutant, spt6-YW, that impairs the physical interaction of
Spt6 with Spn1, has changes in growth, transcription and chromatin structure. Additional studies identified
suppressor mutations that compensate for spt6-YW mutant defects. Several of these suppressor mutations
cause clustered changes in a conserved surface of FACT. Aim 1.1 tests the model that spt6-YW and its
suppressors control transcription and chromatin structure via alterations of the transcription elongation complex
and histone modifications. This will be assayed by a set of ChIP-seq experiments. Aim 1.2 studies the
changes in FACT that compensate for the Spt6 defect. These results will provide new understanding of the
functional relationships among histone chaperones and provide insights into why so many of them are vital
during transcription. Specific Aim 2 focuses on Spt6 binding to histones, an essential function for all of histone
chaperones. This aim tests the model that Spt6 has multiple histone binding sites in its highly acidic and
disordered N-terminal domain. Aim 2.1 will isolate spt6 mutants in the N-terminal region that are defective for
function. Aim 2.2 will use these mutants to define Spt6-histone binding in vitro. Aim 2.3 will address key issues
regarding Spt6-histone interactions during transcription. Together, these experiments will elucidate an
essential function of Spt6. Specific Aim 3 addresses a related but distinct role for Spt6, in the control of
genome integrity, as spt6 mutants display genome instability phenotypes. The proposed experiments will test
whether Spt6 is required for genome stability by the control of chromatin structure, transcription, or resolving
transcription-replication conflicts. Experiments will assay RNA:DNA hybrids, which contribute to genome
instability, double-strand DNA breaks, and will test the model that Spt6 is required for DNA replication as well
as transcription. The results will provide new understanding of the control of genome stability, a fundamental
and conserved process important for human health."

 Active vision requires encoding and remembering relevant information based on current task goals.
Classic accounts posit that sensory encoding, attentional selection and working memory are mediated by
persistent changes in the firing rates, or the gain, of visually responsive neurons that have a fixed tuning profile
(termed “pure” or “fixed-selectivity” neurons). The focus on gain modulations in fixed-selectivity neurons has
revealed a great deal about the basic mechanisms of attention and memory. However, it is becoming increasingly
clear that dynamic changes in task demands may require more flexible coding schemes. For example, holding
information in working memory in the same format as the stimulus-evoked response may lead to interference
with new sensory inputs. Similarly, flexibly encoding sensory representations to complete one task – say a simple
choice between two motor responses – might require a reconfiguration of the representation if another stimulus-
response mapping suddenly becomes relevant. Finally, sensory codes must be flexible in the sense that early
in processing they should form high-dimensional representations to represent as much information as possible
about the current state of the world. Later in processing, when a decision or motor response needs to be made,
the code should collapse to only represent the smaller subset of relevant choices. All of these computations are
more naturally accomplished via the operation of neurons that have flexible tuning for both sensory features and
for task demands (termed “mixed-selectivity” neurons).
 Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that flexible behaviors are supported by mixed-selectivity
neurons that “rotate” high-dimensional neural codes to become robust to interference or to sub-serve other
changes in task demands. We will use modelling, psychophysics, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to test predictions about how mixed-selectivity should modulate large-scale activation patterns that are
measured non-invasively in human subjects. Collectively, this work will challenge traditional theories of sensory
encoding, attention, and working memory that are based on the notion of fixed-selectivity, and will provide
important constraints on models of visual information processing to support more targeted diagnoses and
interventions in clinical settings."

The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a central mediator of two opposing forms of NMDA-
receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD).
Pathological overstimulation of NMDARs during cerebral ischemia causes excitotoxic neuronal cell death, and
we have recently shown that CaMKII mediates also the neuronal damage after global cerebral ischemia (GCI).
Importantly, in vivo injection of our optimized CaMKII inhibitor (tatCN19o) provided significant neuroprotection
after GCI models that closely mimic the most relevant human conditions: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
after cardiac arrest in mice or after ventricular fibrillations in pig (unpublished). CaMKII inhibition (i) was done at
a highly clinically relevant timepoint for these conditions (30 min after CPR); (ii) was effective also in conjunction
with current standard of care (therapeutic hypothermia); and (iii) protected not only from neuronal cell death but
also from the long-lasting functional impairments in LTP that are seen in the surviving neurons.
 Here, three connected but independent aims will directly promote, our mechanistic understanding of CaMKII-
mediated regulation of neuronal cell death and LTP impairment. Specifically, the project will investigate (1) the
cross-talk of CaMKII autonomy mechanisms in mediating ischemia-induced neuronal damage, (2) a possible
dual role of CaMKII in neuronal cell death versus survival, and (3) mechanisms that underly the CaMKII-
dependent long-term LTP impairment of the neurons that survive after ischemia. Together, the results of this
study will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic neuronal
cell death. Additionally, they will inform future development of a therapy in humans."
10740886,"Despite recent advances in targeted and immune-therapies, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic
approaches for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2
(SHP2), encoded by PTPN11, is a key “positive” signaling component, required for RAS/ERK MAP kinase
activation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors, as well as by oncogenic amplified RTKs
and protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) fusion proteins. Recently, potent, orally available, highly specific SHP2
inhibitors were developed. These agents inhibit amplified RTK/PTK-fusion-driven cells/tumors and are in
Phase I clinical trials. Our results suggest that SHP2-inhibitors (SHP2-Is) could have a much broader role in
cancer therapy. SHP2-Is block adaptive resistance to MEK inhibitors (MEK-Is) in KRAS-mutant and -WT cells,
acting upstream of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (SOS1/2). Consequently, SHP2-Is have single agent
efficacy against “cycling” KRAS mutants (e.g., KRASG12C), which retain intrinsic GTPase activity. Supported by
extensive Preliminary Data, we hypothesize that SHP2-Is will also enhance the efficacy of newly developed
KRASG12C (G12C) inhibitors in G12C-mutant NSCLC, the effects of MEK-Is in Osimertinib (Osi)-resistant
EGFR- mutant NSCLC, and the effects of Osi in Osi-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC. SHP2 also binds immune
checkpoint receptors, including PD1, might inhibit immune receptor signaling, and has complex effects on
myeloid cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These pleiotropic actions position SHP2
at the nexus of targeted and immune therapies. This MPI application joins experts in SHP2 action (NEEL) and
NSCLC translational biology (WONG) to clarify the utility of SHP2-Is as NSCLC therapeutics. We will: (1) test
combinations of SHP2-Is with covalent RASG12C inhibitors, MEK-Is, and EGFR-inhibitors in KRAS- and
EGFR-mutant NSCLC GEMMs; (2) clarify cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of these combinations
using state-of-the art immune assays, drug-resistant tumor cells, immune cell depletion and new, inducible
SHP2-I-resistant GEMMs; and (3) analyze recurrent tumors and perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify the
landscape of resistance to these agents."
10994339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT– ANIMAL MODELS CORE
 A main objective of the Animal Models Core is to provide a broad range of behavioral assays of stimulant
and opiate action in mice and rats to support the PPG’s overall goal to establish the molecular and cellular
basis of addiction. Such assays include several routine behavioral tests as well as more sophisticated self-
administration and relapse procedures. It is crucial to employ a broad behavioral battery since it is difficult to
infer something about a complex behavioral syndrome like addiction from a single model or even a limited
number of models. The Core then utilizes these behavioral resources in two main ways. First, the Core
provides microdissections of brain reward regions from rodents that self-administer cocaine or heroin for
molecular-cellular characterization in each Project and the Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core. Second, the
Core works with each of the four Projects to generate causal evidence that directly links specific molecular and
cellular adaptations to particular behavioral abnormalities that define a state of addiction. The Core
accomplishes this goal by providing a range of genetic mutant mice as well as a large number of vectors for
viral-mediated gene transfer, all of which are extensively validated by the Core. The mutant mice and viral
vectors, often generated initially to meet the specific needs of an individual Project, are then provided to other
Projects to broaden their application and thereby promote PPG integration. PPG investigators have led the
field in generating mutant mice and viral vectors, which make it possible to selectively manipulate a given gene
of interest within a particular cell type and brain region of adult animals, thus avoiding confounds with more
traditional approaches. Finally, the Core provides advanced neurophysiology, optogenetic, and fiber
photometry tools to Project investigators to directly relate altered molecular-cellular function to addiction-
related behavioral abnormalities. By consolidating this behavioral, mouse mutant, viral vector, and other work
within a centralized Core, we ensure rigorous control over the data and facilitate comparisons and contrasts of
experimental results across the individual Projects. This consolidation also makes financial sense, since we
concentrate and maximize efficient use of the required expertise."

the PPG’s work. PPG investigators lead the field in several aspects of genome-wide analyses, including
pioneering these approaches to specific cell types in brain, which offers several technical challenges. We have
optimized methods for several next generation sequencing approaches, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-
seq, HiC, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing, among others, for rodent and human brain, the latter
offering an additional set of unique technical challenges. These approaches are being used increasingly to
study individual cell types within a given brain reward region, in both rodent and human. The Core has
established expertise in analyzing the highly complex datasets obtained, and will work on further improving the
tools available. All of the genome-wide data generated by our PPG are analyzed by this Core. In parallel, the
Core runs routine genome-wide assays on defined animal models, with the Animal Models Core, and thereby
provides a foundation for the more specific and sophisticated measures in the individual Projects. Indeed, each
Project focuses on genes that are among the most robustly regulated across rodent addiction models and
human substance use disorders. As well, the Core pilots novel experimental technologies; an example is our
ability to target single chromatin modifications to a single gene within a single brain region and cell type in vivo,
thus providing an unparalleled level of proof to establish transcriptional mechanisms of addiction. By
consolidating the analytical work and routine genome-wide analyses within a centralized Core, we ensure
rigorous control over the data and facilitate comparisons of experimental findings across the four individual

10994341,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT– PROJECT 1
 Project 1's objective is to characterize several novel transcription factors, not previously implicated in
addiction, in mediating the lasting actions of stimulant and opiate drugs of abuse in nucleus accumbens (NAc)
and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Virtually all prior studies of transcription factors in addiction have taken a
candidate approach. This is in marked contrast to an unbiased approach of using “big data” to deduce, in an
open-ended manner, those factors that are most important in mediating specific aspects of the complex
addiction phenotype. We utilize this more powerful approach by taking advantage of large-scale RNA-seq and
related datasets from rodent addiction models and humans with substance use disorders to identify those
factors that appear to play particularly critical roles in drug action. We focus on cell type-specific actions of
three of the most highly ranked transcription factors from our PPG’s datasets: E2F3, ZFP189, and RXR. For
example, ~25% of all genes that display primed or desensitized changes in expression in NAc as a result of
past cocaine self-administration are predicted to be direct targets of E2F3. Based solely on these
bioinformatics predictions, we have generated robust preliminary data to validate the importance of each of
these transcription factors in drug addiction and now propose to better understand their actions. We will
complete characterization of their role in NAc in controlling behavioral responses to cocaine in self-
administration assays as well as map their target genes on a genome-wide basis. Both of these efforts will be
performed in a cell type-specific manner, as we have evidence for some of the factors playing different roles in
different neuronal types in this brain region. This work in animal models will be complemented by studies of
humans with cocaine use disorders, where we already have preliminary evidence for their abnormal regulation.
We will extend these studies to PFC, where we have found that a different E2F3 splice isoform controls
behavioral and genomic responses to cocaine, as well as to opiate models where we know that these factors
also show prominent dysregulation. Together, this work will reveal new transcriptional mechanisms underlying
cocaine and opiate addiction."
10994342,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT– PROJECT 2
 Project 2's objective is to understand the role for circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the mechanisms by which
cocaine remodels the dorsal striatum (DS) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) to precipitate compulsive cocaine-
seeking behaviors. circRNAs are highly conserved single-stranded ‘back-spliced’ RNAs in which the 5′ and 3′
ends of the transcript are covalently joined. Emerging evidence suggests that circRNAs are a major class of
regulatory noncoding RNAs that are enriched in brain and that play key roles in basic aspects of neuronal
function, but their involvement in the molecular, cellular, and behavioral actions of cocaine (and other drugs of
abuse) has yet not been investigated. We will characterize patterns of circRNA expression in DS and NAc of
mice that show compulsive-like cocaine consumption using paired-end ribominus RNA-sequencing. We will
also assess circRNA expression in postmortem striatal tissues from humans with cocaine use disorders. We
already have robust evidence for prominent cocaine regulation of several circRNAs in these brain regions.
Those cocaine-responsive circRNAs that show similar abnormal expression in mice and humans will be
prioritized for further investigation. We will determine whether prioritized cocaine-responsive circRNAs are
regulated specifically in different types of DS and NAc neurons. We will then investigate the role played by
these prioritized cocaine-responsive circRNAs in regulating the molecular and cellular responses to cocaine
within these cell types of DS and NAc. This will be accomplished by use of in vivo CRISPR technology or RNAi
to knockdown prioritized circRNAs in a cell type-specific manner and assess the influence of these circrRNAs
in controlling baseline and cocaine-induced alterations in the intrinsic excitability of the neurons as well as their
transcriptional responses to cocaine. Finally, we will investigate the ways in which cocaine-responsive
circRNAs control compulsive-like cocaine self-administration behavior including relapse in mice. These highly
innovative studies promise to yield fundamentally new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
cocaine addiction, with parallel future studies planned for opiate drugs of abuse."
10994343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT– PROJECT 3
 Project 3's objective is to address the role of microglia in modulating transcriptional adaptations in striatal
medium spiny neurons (MSNs) triggered by cocaine self-administration. Microglia contribute to normal brain
development and function by supporting neuronal survival and removing non-functional neurons and synapses.
We have found that ablation of microglia causes a robust increase in behavioral responses to cocaine or to a
D1 dopamine receptor agonist as well as an increase in dendritic spine density on MSNs. These findings
suggest the hypothesis that microglia may function homeostatically to oppose conditions of excessive
dopaminergic transmission, such as seen with cocaine exposure. We also have found that 10-15% of microglia
in striatum, but not other brain regions, express the D1 receptor, raising the novel possibility of direct effects of
cocaine (via increased dopaminergic transmission) on microglia. We now propose to fully characterize the
influence of microglia in controlling behavioral responses to cocaine in self-administration models. This will
include delineating a role for all microglia in striatum as well as a possible selective role played by D1+
microglia and by D1 receptor signaling within those microglia. We will next characterize the influence of
microglia—again D1+ and D1- subpopulations—on the ability of cocaine self-administration to influence gene
expression profiles in the D1-type and D2-type MSNs of striatum, separately examining nucleus accumbens
and dorsal striatum. We will also characterize the changes in gene expression induced by cocaine self-
administration in D1+ and D1- subpopulations of microglia themselves within striatum. These experiments are
made possible by several novel lines of genetic mutant mice that enable the selective manipulation of
microglial subpopulations within striatum combined with RNA-seq of isolated neuronal and microglia cell
types—and even at the single cell level. These investigations of cocaine set the stage for follow up studies of
microglia in opiate action as well as in humans with substance use disorders. Overall, the proposal has the
potential to provide paradigm-shifting information about the role of microglia in the pathophysiology of drug
addiction."

acetylation), and are enriched in several chromatin remodeling factors. One example is BRD4, a member of
the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) subfamily, which binds acetylated histones through its
bromodomains and is tightly linked with enhancers in several tissues. We have found elevated tissue levels of
both H3K27ac and BRD4 in striatum of humans with heroin use disorders, with such elevations correlating
strongly with years of heroin use and expression levels of key gene networks. Similar regulation is seen in
striatum of rats that self-administer heroin. Moreover, we have found that small molecules that disrupt
BRD4/BET function—in clinical development for cancer treatment—exert therapeutic-like effects in heroin
addiction models in rodents. This Project will further these studies in several ways. We will obtain genome-
wide maps of enhancer regions in NAc and DS of humans with heroin use disorders and matched controls,
and in rats after heroin self-administration, by use of ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and BRD4, among other marks, in
conjunction with the Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core. This will be performed separately on nuclei isolated
from neurons and non-neuronal cells of these brain regions. We will work with the Core on advanced
bioinformatics approaches to overlay these datasets, which is required for reliable identification of enhancers,
along with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets that we are currently generating on the same samples and that
will provide further insight into the specific target genes affected by the identified heroin-regulated enhancers.
We will test the causal role of enhancer regulation in heroin addiction by studying the effect of bidirectional
manipulations of BRD4 in NAc and DS on gene expression and behavioral endpoints in rat models, including
screening several BRD4/BET inhibitors for anti-addiction actions. These studies offer a translational
opportunity to advance novel therapies for drug addiction."
10764789,"1 This MIRA project will advance understanding of the function of tyrosine sulfation, a fundamental
 2 modification that regulates diverse biological functions. For example, sulfation plays a critical role
 3 in entry of HIV into human cells, in the interaction of microbial molecules with host immune
 4 receptors and in the activity of tick-derived peptides, which hold potential for treatment of blood
 5 clotting associated with cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing awareness of the
 6 importance of tyrosine sulfation, most sulfated peptide complexes have not yet been fully
 7 characterized. Further, we have only a partial view of the components essential for transducing
 8 the response of such activated complexes. We also have limited strategies for efficiently
 9 producing and testing the therapeutic potential of sulfated molecules. The PI is well positioned to
10 address these challenges. With support from the NIH, the PI discovered the host XA21 immune
11 receptor, a protein that is representative of a large class of plant and animal receptors. Further,
12 the PI's team isolated and characterized a sulfated peptide secreted by a Gram-negative
13 bacterium that binds to the XA21 receptor and activates the immune response. We propose
14 research in three related areas: We will isolate and characterize the diversity of receptors that
15 bind sTyr peptides, identify and analyze sTyr binding interfaces and pioneer a strategy to produce
16 novel sulfated molecules in an efficient manner. To accomplish our goals, we will employ new
17 experimental tools and approaches. These include use of established whole genome sequenced
18 mutant lines to rapidly assess phenotypes of newly discovered genes, sensitive assays to assess
19 ligand binding, state-of-the-art mass yeast cell surface display and spectrometry approaches to
20 engineer receptors and identify key components of immune complexes. The knowledge gained
21 from this research will provide new insights into an essential biological process, laying the
22 foundation for the development of reagents capable of inhibiting or activating cellular interactions
23 with a high degree of affinity and specificity with potential applications in research, agriculture and
24 medicine."
10745643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As polypharmacy becomes increasingly common in patients with kidney disease, drug-drug interactions
(DDIs), the phenomenon of one drug altering the effect of another drug, grow as potential sources of
preventable harm in this vulnerable population. The clinical impacts of DDIs are poorly understood, particularly
in the hospital setting, where up to half of patients have acute or chronic kidney disease. Further, the potential
for bidirectional relationships between kidney disease and DDIs—with kidney disease functioning as both an
outcome of DDIs and a baseline factor that alters DDI severity—complicates epidemiologic study and
necessitates novel methodologic approaches.
 This proposal aims to improve the safety of pharmacotherapy in patients with kidney disease through
the following broad objectives: 1) examine whether commonly used antibiotics in the hospital setting interact to
increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD); 2) examine
whether changes in kidney function in turn produce variability in DDI severity; 3) train the applicant in renal
pharmacoepidemiology, prospective research design and analysis, and pharmacokinetic simulation methods,
which will enable a novel translational approach to DDI research; and 4) provide the preliminary data and
mechanistic insights for future R01 funded studies that quantify the health impacts of DDIs in the kidney
disease population and develop preventive interventions.
 The applicant will integrate the results from large scale pharmacoepidemiologic studies, prospective
cohort studies, and simulation models to achieve the stated objectives. The applicant will first determine the
impact of a potential DDI between two common antibiotics on inpatient AKI risk and subsequent CKD using a
large-scale health system database and prospective cohort study (Aim 1). The applicant will then examine the
effect of kidney disease on the magnitude of a DDI mediated by hepatic CYP450 inhibition using two distinct,
yet complementary approaches: developing a pharmacokinetic simulation model of the interaction, followed by
a retrospective cohort study of the same interaction (Aim 2). Integration of methods will provide insights into
the effects of kidney disease on CYP inhibition that wouldn't be possible with either method in isolation.
 This proposal will train the candidate in renal pharmacoepidemiology, advanced statistical modeling,
and pharmacokinetic simulation, and have important implications for drug safety in the 35 million hospital
admissions each year. This research will generate new knowledge extending beyond the specific drugs under
study and foster the candidate's progression towards becoming an independent investigator in renal
pharmacoepidemiology."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of covalently closed RNA species derived from “back
splicing” of pre-mRNAs. Mounting evidence suggests the essential roles of circRNAs in governing
healthy brain development and their abnormalities in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Many circRNAs are unique and highly abundant in the human brain, which are thought to underlie the
sophisticated function of human brains and the fragility of various brain diseases. Mechanistically,
circRNAs can function through sponging microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins, which broadly regulate
numerous biological pathways. Our current knowledge of molecular mechanisms that regulate
circRNA biogenesis in the human brain is still in its infancy. In particular, circRNA biology in human
glial cells are poorly understood. Whether neurons and glia cells possess distinct circRNA landscapes
and downstream interactomes remain entirely unknown. The biological functions of circRNAs in
governing brain development and modulating lesion repair are vastly elusive. These prevailing
knowledge gaps limit the current understanding of the complex etiology of many brain diseases. Our
long-term goals are to elucidate the regulation and function of circRNAs in healthy and diseased
brains, which may help to develop novel therapeutics against brain illnesses. In this application, we
focus on circRNA biology in oligodendroglia (OL). OLs are responsible for myelination of the central
nervous system and affected in numerous diseases, represented by multiple sclerosis and
schizophrenia. Our preliminary data revealed that the RNA-binding protein QKI advances biogenesis
of a human OL circRNA, which can promote differentiation of human and rodent OLs. We established
state-of-the-art technical platforms to identify circRNA landscapes and interactomes in human OL and
neurons. We hypothesize that human circRNAs play essential roles in controlling OL and myelin
development, and QKI mediates developmental signals to enhance human OL circRNA biogenesis.
In Aim 1, we will determine how QKI regulates OL circRNA biogenesis to advance OL differentiation.
In Aim 2, we will determine developmental regulation of human OL circRNA landscapes, downstream
pathways, and mechanisms of circRNA action in OLs from multiple platforms with integrated
analyses. In Aim 3, we will explore whether human OL circRNA pathways can promote OL lineage
development in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendrocyte spheres (hOLS)
or myelin lesion repair in a well-established mouse model. Findings from these studies will provide
novel insights on fundamental rules governing human OL function and myelin repair."
10745276,"ABSTRACT:
The vast majority of human mutations have minor allele frequencies (MAF) under 1%, with the plurality
observed only once (i.e., “singletons”). While Mendelian diseases are predominantly caused by rare alleles,
the cumulative contribution of rare variants to complex phenotypes remains hotly debated. In our recent
work, we demonstrated that ultrarare variants (MAF<0.01%) make a substantial contribution to the genetic
architecture of human transcriptional regulation (an intermediate between genetic variation and complex
disease)1, and low frequency variants constitute nearly half the heritability of several complex traits (on
average)2. In this study, we will functionally validate the role that ultrarare variants play in human gene
expression using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). MPRA have revolutionized the way
enhancers can be assayed for activity. We will utilize MPRAs to functionally validate our finding that
ultrarare variants dominate the genetic architecture of human gene expression. We will use insights from
this technology to drive statistical and bioinformatic improvements in the way genetic variation data are
analyzed. We will then expand our analysis to quantify the genetic architecture of gene expression across
tissues. All tissues in the human body derive from essentially the same DNA but exhibit remarkably different
patterns of gene expression. We will extend our Haseman-Elston (HE) regression approach for modeling
the genetic architecture of gene expression to multiple traits to uncover cross-tissue and tissue-specific
genetic effects using WGS and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the GTEx project5. Finally, we will
improve genomic-based precision medicine efforts for all by characterizing the population-specific genetic
architecture of complex traits. Every human population has experienced a different evolutionary history in
the recent past (different pathogens, different limits on reproductive growth, etc). Each population therefore
has a different distribution of genetic variation. As a consequence, different populations likely have different
genetic architectures for complex traits. Further, many understudied populations are admixed (with ancestry
deriving from multiple populations). We will extend our HE regression approach to model shared and
population-specific genetic effects using >140 thousand samples from multiple populations with whole
genome sequencing data and complex trait data from the TOPMed Project6."
10761726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor
types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other
solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In
particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment
regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are
currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and
experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity,
for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance
and tumor recurrence.
The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and
their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent
states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis.
In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures
required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine
acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target.
The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for
identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and
PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key
experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models.
If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene
networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also
define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide
data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by
triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells."
10759468,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Development of effective therapies is an urgent unmet medical need for patients with metastatic
gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (mGEA). The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-
programmed death (PD)-1 antibodies has revolutionized treatment of some cancers but benefits only a
minority of patients with GEA. Combination approaches are required to extend this benefit to more patients.
Most studies of immunotherapy combinations in GEA initiate PD-1 blockade at the same time as cytotoxic
therapy despite the possibility that cytotoxic agents may kill some of the very T cells invigorated by PD-1
blockade, as our group and others have shown. Our long-term goal is to develop immunotherapy combinations
that avoid this problem through rational sequencing of immunotherapy with other anti-cancer agents to
enhance tumor destruction and improve patient survival. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
serial combination immunotherapy utilizing anti-PD-1 and anti-angiogenesis therapy with immunomodulatory
chemotherapy in a predefined sequence leads to meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes in association
with disruption of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promotion of antitumor systemic
immune responses. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a phase II trial to determine the therapeutic
efficacy of serial combination immunotherapy and examine its impact on local and systemic immune responses
in patients with mGEA through the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the therapeutic efficacy of
serial combination immunotherapy in patients with metastatic GEA. Aim 2 will interrogate patient samples
collected longitudinally from the parent trial to identify the impact of serial immunotherapy on
immunosuppressive, antitumor, and angiogenic components within the tumor environment, including tumor-
related local and systemic immune responses. Our expected outcomes are to show improved clinical efficacy
using an innovative immunotherapy combination in which PD-1 blockade is delivered in a predefined sequence
and to gain critical knowledge on the impact of this serial immunotherapy approach on tumor-related local and
systemic immune responses in patients with mGEA patients. Together, these new proof-of-concept data are
expected to inform the design of future definitive clinical trials that can improve the survival of patients with
immunotherapy-resistant metastatic GEA."

Integrins are cell surface receptors that mediate numerous interactions between cells and their environment.
Binding of integrin α5β1 to its ligand fibronectin in the extracellular matrix plays fundamental roles in cellular
adhesion and differentiation. In blood cells these interactions mediate biological processes including
erythropoiesis and monocyte adhesion and contribute to pathologies such as sickle cell disease, dysregulation
of hematopoiesis, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis. Integrin α5β1 undergoes two distinct conformational changes:
extension at the ‘knees’ and opening of the ligand-binding headpiece. These changes give rise to an ensemble
of three interconverting integrin conformational states on cell surfaces: low-affinity bent-closed (BC) and
extended-closed (EC) conformations and a high-affinity extended-open (EO) conformation. This proposal
leverages ground-breaking work under the previous award in which we measured free energy and intrinsic
affinity of each integrin α5β1 state. Using the same Fab tools as used for these equilibrium measurements to
stabilize the extended, closed, or open α5β1 conformations, we now propose three aims. In Aim 1, we explore
how Mn2+, high Mg2+, and low Ca2+ concentrations activate integrins. Our preliminary results show that Mn2+
and high Mg2+ both increase the population of the EO state and increase its intrinsic affinity for ligand and that
these effects are dependent on the ADMIDAS metal-ion binding site. To examine why cell surface α5β1 is so
stable in the BC state, we test the hypothesis that the α and β-subunit TM domains separate from one another
in both the EC and EO states. Aims 2 and 3 measure kinetics to map the activation trajectory of integrin α5β1,
i.e. the sequence of ligand binding and conformational change events that occur between the resting state,
when 99.8% of unliganded integrin α5β1 is in the BC state, and the final, functional liganded EO state (EO•L)
state that is bound to fibronectin and is stabilized by tensile force that is applied to the integrin by actin
retrograde flow and resisted by fibronectin in the matrix. In Aim 2, we measure the intrinsic ligand-binding
kinetics of each state (kon and koff). Our preliminary data indicates, surprisingly, that the low-affinity BC and EC
states bind more rapidly to ligand than the EO state, which is compensated by the >10,000-fold slower off-rate
of the EO state. In Aim 3, we measure the kinetics of integrin conformational change using single-molecule
FRET probes that measure either the extension or opening steps in the presence or absence of conformation-
specific Fabs and ligand. Kinetics of all transitions between the BC, EC, and EO states for unliganded and
ligand-bound single integrin molecules will be determined for both purified, soluble ectodomain and intact
integrins on blood cells using TIRF microscopy with high temporal resolution. We expect to show an integrin
activation trajectory in which ligand binds to the BC+EC states, followed by ligand-facilitated conformational
conversion to the EO•L state, followed by cytoskeletal adaptor (A) binding and stabilization of the EO•L•A state
by force applied by the cytoskeleton and resisted by extracellular ligand."
10752637,"Injury to the cervical spinal cord results in an immediate and permanent loss of hand function due to massive
disruption of neural circuitry. There are currently no effective therapies that can improve neurological outcomes
for individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI). New neurons can be provided to injury sites via transplantation
of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). These cells differentiate into diverse subtypes of neurons that support the
establishment of new synaptic connections with neurons in the injured host nervous system. Multiple studies
have reported modest gains in forelimb function following NPC transplantation in preclinical cervical SCI models;
however, the underlying mechanisms by which engrafted neurons promote functional recovery are unclear. In
order to develop more effective neural replacement strategies that can robustly and reproducibly improve
recovery of hand function, it is critical to develop a fundamental understanding of how engrafted neurons
synaptically and functionally integrate into injured forelimb motor circuitry. To address this gap in knowledge, we
will utilize a mouse model of SCI to characterize the contributions of NPC grafts to forelimb functional recovery.
First, we will determine how varying the phenotypes of transplanted neurons influences graft synaptic integration
into the injured nervous system. We have shown that NPC grafts can be enriched for distinct classes of neurons.
We will use this strategy to determine how manipulating graft cellular composition influences integration with
injured motor circuits. Second, we will determine whether graft neuron activity is sufficient to functionally
modulate forelimb motor circuits. Through chemogenetic modulation of engrafted neurons, we will interrogate
the functional contributions of graft activity to electrophysiological responses in the forelimb muscles. We will
also determine whether graft activity is acutely required for the execution of skilled forelimb motor function.
Finally, we will examine whether activity-based rehabilitation can increase synaptic integration of grafts into
forelimb motor circuits and improve motor functional recovery. This study will establish a new and critical
framework regarding the ability of engrafted neurons to integrate into and functionally modulate injured forelimb
motor circuitry. Moreover, this work will highlight the critical importance of graft cellular composition in restoring
functional outcomes. Our strategy to functionally interrogate NPC grafts has applications for broader work
focused on restoring locomotor or autonomic outcomes after spinal cord injury. Results of this study will reveal
new biological mechanisms by which neural grafts can provide therapeutic benefits. These findings will constitute
a critical body of knowledge that will accelerate research efforts to develop more therapeutically effective human
cells for clinical treatment of spinal cord injury."
10754249,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are enzymes that regulate an enormous number of biological processes
through the modulation of their target proteins (substrates). PTPs do this by catalyzing the removal of a
phosphate group from the amino acid tyrosine in their targets, which alters the activity of the target enzyme.
The misregulation of PTPs are linked to a number of diseases including type II diabetes, obesity, cancer, and
inflammation and therefore PTPs are viewed as potential drug targets. A primary obstacle to drugging PTPs is
that the sites of their enzymatic action (active sites) are nearly identical, thus targeting a specific PTP enzyme
by a drug focused on the active site has not been a productive endeavor. A solution to the problem is to target
the drug to sites on PTPs that are distant from the active site, the so-called allosteric sites, which are not
identical across the family of PTPs. A difficulty with this approach is the challenge of identification and
characterization of these allosteric sites to obtain a better understanding of how they interact, from long
molecular distances, with the active site. We hypothesize that different substrates alter the protein structure in
a distinct manner and cause different allosteric sites to be exposed. We plan to test this hypothesis and
characterize these allosteric sites through a powerful combination of solution nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, biochemical, and computational approaches in two medically important human enzymes,
protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) phosphatase. Our aims are:
To identify and characterize substrate dependent allosteric sites in PTP1B and VHR using different substrate
peptides from the natural in vivo targets of these PTPs. We will identify these sites by monitoring changes in
NMR chemical shift and dynamics parameters. In complementary experiments we will use novel computational
methods developed by our research team to further understand the mechanism of allostery in these enzymes.
Subsequently we will validate our newly identified allosteric sites by mutation followed by functional assays and
computational methods to better understand the impact of the allosteric sites on the substrate specific
enzymatic activity in PTP1B and VHR."

Optic neuritis (ON) is an acute autoimmune disease caused by immune attack on the myelin that protects the
optic nerve leading to vision loss. Steroid treatments accelerate recovery of visual acuity in some patients but
have no effect on other visual functions such as contrast sensitivity that are important for activities of daily life.
Even with steroid treatments, 13,000 ON patients per year fail to fully recover visual acuity and 50% of ON
patients eventually convert to multiple sclerosis. New therapies are needed to improve ON patient outcomes and
quality-of-life. Aberrant activation of T and B lymphocytes drives ON pathologies. Targeting these pathogenic
cells is a potential therapeutic strategy. Our company, Trethera, has conducted extensive preclinical studies to
develop a small molecule drug, TRE-515, that has the potential to selectively block lymphocyte activation in ON
by inhibiting deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), a key rate-limiting enzyme in the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway.
Our preliminary studies show (i) that cells of the immune system activate dCK during all phases of disease in
the C57Bl/6 MOG35-55 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of ON, (ii) that TRE-515
blocks dCK activity in immune cells in this model, (iii) that TRE-515 blocks phenotypes of CNS demyelination in
this model, (iv) that TRE-515 blocks inflammation of the optic nerve in this model, (v) that TRE-515 blocks T cell
activation in culture, (vi) that TRE-515 blocks B and T cell activation in this model, and (vii) that TRE-515
treatments and dCK knockout are not associated with significant toxicities. Collectively, these data strongly
suggest that TRE-515 could be an important new therapy for ON. In support of this, the FDA recently awarded
TRE-515 Orphan Drug Status for ON. In the proposed Fast-Track project, we will conduct critical preclinical
studies to confirm the safety properties of TRE-515 as a therapy for ON, to study the ON disease stage that
TRE-515 affects, to identify the appropriate dosage regimen, and to identify potential biomarkers of target
engagement. In Phase I, we will study whether TRE-515 administered therapeutically can block ON symptoms
(Aim 1) and evaluate the genotoxicity of TRE-515 (Aim 2). In Phase II, we will examine the dose-response
relationship between TRE-515 and ON symptoms in the MOG35-55 EAE mouse model of ON (Aim 3), evaluate
the effect of TRE-515 in an additional ON model (Aim 4), study the mechanisms through which TRE-515 blocks
lymphocyte proliferation (Aim 5), and evaluate whether plasma deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine levels could
serve as biomarkers of TRE-515 target engagement (Aim 6). This IND-enabling work will be critical for moving
TRE-515 into the clinical for ON patients and for designing clinical trials with the highest chance of success."

The respiratory control system displays a remarkable capacity for neuroplasticity, imparting flexibility of breathing
in response to changing physiological or environmental conditions across the lifespan. Gonadal hormones
(estrogens, progestins, androgens) exert powerful modulatory effects and directly influence the development of
neuroplasticity in other neural control areas. Yet, the role of gonadal hormone signaling in the development
respiratory neuroplasticity has not been clearly defined. The overarching hypothesis guiding this proposal is that
gonadal hormone signaling within the spinal cord is necessary to enable expression of respiratory
neuroplasticity through regulation of spinal microglia. Five important preliminary findings support this
hypothesis. First, while estrogens and progestins are typically associated as the principal gonadal hormones in
females, whereas androgens are considered the primary gonadal hormone in males, it is in fact estradiol in both
sexes that is required to permit respiratory neuroplasticity. Second, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol
directly within the spinal cord to elicit plasticity in males. Third, the estrogen receptor isoforms (ERα, ERβ and
GPER) essential for enabling respiratory plasticity are unique in females and males. Fourth, estradiol
supplementation or the pharmacological activation of spinal estrogen receptors is sufficient to rescue plasticity
following removal of the gonads in both sexes. Fifth, treating the spinal cord with a localized anti-inflammatory,
or reducing the population of CNS microglia (using a CSF1R inhibitor), is sufficient to restore respiratory
neuroplasticity in rats of both sexes following removal of the gonads, indicating a role for spinal microglia in the
estrogen-induced recovery of plasticity. Using rigorous neurophysiologic measures of respiratory neuroplasticity
in combination with estrogen receptor pharmacology, targeted gene manipulation by siRNA knockdown, flow
cytometry, mass spectroscopy, and protein biochemistry, we will dissect the role of spinal estrogen receptor
signaling for expression of respiratory neuroplasticity. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: 1) Spinal ER
signaling is necessary for induction of respiratory neuroplasticity in female and male rats; 2) Spinal estrogen
signaling is sufficient to restore respiratory plasticity when sex steroid levels are systemically reduced; and 3)
Estrogen permits respiratory plasticity through modulation of spinal cord microglia. These studies address a
critical gap in our basic biological understanding of respiratory neural function; how sex hormone signaling
enables development of respiratory neuroplasticity. In addition, our results will directly inform ongoing
translational studies targeting mechanisms of respiratory neuroplasticity for therapeutic benefit."

Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS)/Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a chronic pelvic pain disorder with at least one urinary
symptom and the perception that the pain originates from the bladder. Stress exacerbates symptoms of
BPS/IC. Despite intense research, we lack understanding of how structural and functional changes in the
micturition reflex are linked to BPS/IC and how stress exacerbates symptoms, thus impeding effective
therapies. Addressing these challenges requires, in part: (1) a novel hypothesis involving NGF/TrkA/MAPK
signaling for downstream transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 4
(TRPV4)/Ca2+ activation in the sensory components of the micturition reflex; (2) innovative and multidisciplinary
approaches; and (3) animal models that recapitulate the clinical signs/symptoms of BPS/IC including symptom
exacerbation (flares) precipitated by psychological stress. Our laboratory is unique in the complementary use
of several relevant models to reinforce our studies including (e.g., cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis,
transgenic mice with chronic, urothelial overexpression of NGF (NGF-OE), repeated, low dose CYP (alone
insufficient to produce significant symptoms) coupled with repeated variate stress (RVS) to assess how stress
can exacerbate disease. Our overall hypothesis is that increases in urinary frequency and pelvic sensation that
accompany BPS/IC reflect increased expression, function and interactions of neurochemical mediators and the
sensory transducer, TRPV4, in the sensory components of the micturition reflex that favor a pro-excitatory
state. Building from our previous work, the maladaptive role(s) of NGF/TrkA/p75NTR signaling and downstream
activation of TRPV4/Ca2+ in the sensory components of the micturition reflex will be assessed as contributory
mechanisms to BPS/IC. Aim 1: Determine if interrupting NGF/TrkA/p75NTR signaling pathways reduces voiding
frequency and pelvic pain by: reducing (1) urothelial Ca2+ events; (2) urothelial ATP release and (3) bladder
afferent activity. Further interrupting NGF/p75NTR signaling reduces voiding frequency by: (1) reducing
urothelial cell apoptosis; (2) promoting urothelial cell recovery and (3) maintaining transepithelial resistance.
Aim 2: Determine if disruption of NGF signaling in the micturition pathway has short- and long-term
consequences on TRPV4/Ca2+ function in BPS/IC-like symptoms. The acute NGF-mediated TRPV4/Ca2+
BPS/IC-related responses include heightened urothelial Ca2+ signaling, urothelial ATP secretion and bladder
afferent nerve activity. Maladaptive, long-term NGF signaling promotes BPS/IC by increasing TRPV4 transcript
and protein expression. Using three models with BPS/IC-like symptoms and a multidisciplinary, cell-tissue-
systems experimental approach, we will determine: (1) underlying structural and functional changes
contributory to BPS/IC-like symptoms; (2) the influence of psychological stress on bladder function and pain
and (3) novel treatments."
10744724,"Engineered skin tissues must reproduce the biological and mechanical functions of their native counterparts if
they are to provide health benefits to society. However, engineered skin substitute (ESS) only fulfills basic skin
functions and fails to match the structural and biophysical characteristics of the human skin, such as missing
hair follicle and sweat gland, limiting its use in vivo. Their absences are due to a lack of functioning cell types
that instruct human keratinocytes in ESS to make a hair follicle and a lack of an in-depth understanding of
essential epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that drive hair follicle formation. In the case of hair follicle
engineering, the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between keratinocytes and their immediate dermal
environment need to be precisely modulated to govern hair follicle lineage commitment. The major cell type that
constitutes a unique dermal “niche” is a specialized population of fibroblasts, which are located at the base of
the hair follicle, called the dermal papilla (DP), and are different from normal human dermal fibroblasts. However,
it is of great difficulty to isolate and expand human DP fibroblasts in vitro while maintaining their inductive capacity
for tissue engineering purposes. The long-term goal is to develop novel bioengineering approaches to produce
a fully functional human skin equivalent with normal microanatomy. The central hypothesis is that hair follicle
induction is an emergent property of skin constructs, which requires the interplay of multiple signals and cell
types in an inductive microenvironment. The objectives are to systemically explore how to create an inductive
microenvironment in ESS to induce hair follicle formation. To achieve this, we have devised a three-pronged
strategy addressing hair follicle bioengineering in ESS: 1) mimic the original niche by fabricating composite
keratinocyte-DP cell spheroids in micropatterned ESS; 2) enhance intercellular interactions by adding BMP6 and
3) drive the DP phenotype by re-activating master transcription factors. In the first aim, we will determine if multi-
cell type spheroids combined with premade hair canals can mimic a natural niche in ESS. We have developed
two 3D composite spheroid models and will determine whether they will allow DP fibroblasts to expand in vitro
while maintaining DP inductivity to induce hair follicles in a laser micropatterned skin substitute model. In the
second aim, we will determine the inductive functions of Bmp6 in stimulating hair follicle formation in ESS. We
will dissect the roles of Bmp6 in hair follicle formation and growth. In the third aim, we will determine whether
human DP fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to reestablish hair inductivity. We will assess whether in vitro genetic
reprogramming of human DP fibroblasts by CRISPRa-mediated expression of master transcription factors
promote the ability of composite keratinocyte-DP cell spheroids to induce hair follicles in ESS. This work will
provide novel mechanistic knowledge of spatial niche arrangement, inductive signals, and genetic programs that
is critical to promote hair follicle neogenesis in ESS. The outcomes are significant because it will accelerate hair
follicle bioengineering and advance complex in vitro and in vivo tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."

numerous complementary analyses in the etiology of multiple neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
disorders. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), along with splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) and
structural variant quantitative trait loci (svQTLs), are genomic variants that differ between individuals, with
these differences correlating with functional changes to gene expression or splicing behavior. Many of these
QTLs show specificity to tissues, brain regions, developmental stages, or cell types, and a proportion overlap
with known genetic risk factors of human disorders. Here, we propose to pursue three integrated Aims,
including whole-genome sequencing and both bulk tissue and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, to identify
genomic variants, eQTL/sQTL/svQTLs, and patterns of gene expression and co-expression in two regions of
the human brain across mid-fetal development through to adolescence. In addition, we will apply novel and
newly developed computational tools to associate these QTLs with specific cell types and loci or genes
implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. By so doing we will augment, and dramatically expand upon, earlier
efforts to understand QTLs and their roles in neural development, function, and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10745278,"A major long-term goal of this proposal is to understand human brain development and the origins of neurodevelopmental diseases. The cerebral cortex is a structure where model systems, such as mouse or rat, may not capture the complexity of architecture and function relevant for understanding human development and disease. This proposal aims to address the gap in our understanding of human cortical development through the study of primary tissue complemented by human stem cell-derived in vitro model systems, using “cerebral organoids”. Understanding human-specific aspects of brain development is not only critically important for understanding the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia and ultimately developing therapies, but will also benefit our understanding of human cortical evolution, the diversity and lineage of neural cell types, and the mechanisms of cortical expansion - it will help define what makes us unique. The developing human brain contains an enlarged proliferative region, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) that is not present in rodents. This study will target two recently discovered neural progenitor cell types found in the OSVZ, outer radial glia (oRG) and intermediate progenitor (IP) cells. These cell types are particularly important as they underlie the huge developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human brain. This proposal seeks to illuminate the complexity of human cortical development in terms of the genomic, cellular, and behavioral features of its constituent oRG and IP neural progenitor cells and their progeny through the key stages of neurogenesis. We plan to discover lineage trajectories that define progenitor-progeny relationships and determine the cellular fates of clonal descendants. We will use novel oRG and IPC markers to enrich progenitor cell populations for analysis, explore the intracellular signaling networks that regulate IP cell expansion, investigate the role of distinct neurogenic niches in creating neuronal diversity, and examine neuron to progenitor signaling pathways that may regulate IPC neurogenesis. Additionally, we will explore the role of oRGs and IPCs in lissencephaly and related neurodevelopmental diseases, and pursue an intriguing relationship between oRG cells and invasive glioblastoma. These ambitious goals are attainable due to recent technological advances, including improvements in single cell genomics, bioinformatics, real time imaging of primary tissue samples, and in vitro models of human cortical development. The outcome holds promise to transform our understanding of human brain development in health and disease."
10757316,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health concern with nearly 2-million new cases of CRC diagnosed
worldwide in 2019. While surgical resection of the primary tumor offers a cure for some, up to half of patients
undergoing colorectal surgery will develop a postoperative recurrence. With a median survival of only 24 months,
almost all patients whom develop a postoperative recurrence will die from their disease with current therapies;
there is thus an immediate need to develop new strategies to understand and prevent CRC recurrence. Despite
increasing evidence that intestinal bacteria plays a major role in the pathogenesis of primary CRC, how gut
microbes influence the development of CRC recurrence has never been addressed.
 To address this gap in knowledge, Benjamin Shogan MD has developed exciting data demonstrating that
CRC recurrence is a microbial driven process. For reasons that remain poorly understood, a high-fat Western
diet is the major risk factor for the development of both primary and recurrent CRC. He has discovered that when
mice fed a high-fat diet undergo intestinal resection (mimicking the surgery patients undergo for CRC cure)
collagenase producing organisms, especially Enterococcus faecalis preferentially colonizes the site of
reconnection. He has found that E. faecalis can over-activate critical extracellular matrix proteases, including the
urokinase(uPA)-plasminogen system, creating an environment abundant in signals (i.e. uPA, MMP9,
plasminogen) well-known to promote tumor progression. Strikingly, when CT26 mouse carcinoma cells are
present intraluminally at the time of surgery (mimicking exfoliated viable tumor cells that exist in human patients),
they can migrate through healing intestinal tissue to develop tumors identical to human CRC recurrence only
when mice are fed a high-fat diet and colonized with collagenolytic organisms. Recent in vitro experiments have
found that E. faecalis promotes enhanced invasion and migration of CT26 cells, suggesting that at the
intersection of CRC recurrence is bacterial induced metastasis of tumor cells through permeable intestinal tissue.
 In this K08 application, Dr. Shogan creates a career development plan to acquire his long-term goal of
becoming a principal investigator examining how modulation of the intestinal microbiome can improve survival
outcomes in patients with CRC. With the guidance of his mentors Ralph Weichselbaum MD and Eugene Chang
MD, he will test the hypothesis that the perioperative proliferation of collagenolytic organisms by a high-fat diet
creates an intestinal microenvironment that promotes the extraluminal migration of cancer cells, driving CRC
recurrence. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, and samples from his human patients, he will explicate the
mechanisms by which collagenolytic organisms, via its interaction with the extracellular matrix, drives the
transluminal migration of CT26 cells to form extraluminal tumors. Completion of this work will inform the
interaction between host-microbe-cancer cells, and force a complete rethinking and development of novel
strategies to prevent and treat colorectal cancer."
10948067,"Introduction: This is the second submission of a VA HSR&D CDA proposal for Seppo Rinne, MD PhD. Dr.
Rinne is a practicing VA Pulmonologist, Clinical Informaticist, and a Core Investigator in the HSR&D Center for
Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research (CHOIR). This proposal incorporates extensive
revisions to address prior reviewer comments, which has led to a refined research focus and a rigorous career
development plan. Since the first CDA submission, Dr. Rinne transferred to a new VA research environment
that is closely aligned with his career goals, updated his mentoring and advising team to support these new
goals, and established strong working relationships with key operational partners. The current proposal builds
on Dr. Rinne’s previous training experiences and preliminary research to improve multidisciplinary coordination
of pulmonary care by developing and implementing a theoretically-based informatics intervention.
Background: Access to specialty care is often insufficient to meet demand. To improve timeliness and
efficiency of specialty care, VA implemented electronic consultations (e-consults), which allow asynchronous
provider-provider coordination through the electronic health record. However, limited research has considered
potential unintended consequences of e-consults on patients’ and providers’ relationships and their quality of
communication. Relational Coordination (RC) Theory provides insight that can address these gaps in
knowledge and inform the design and implementation of e-consult interventions.
Objective: To combine RC Theory with an established implementation model to guide the following Aims:
 Aim 1: Explore patient, PCP, and pulmonologist perspectives of e-consults and relationships.
 Aim 2: Develop consensus on essential components of pulmonary e-consult communication.
 Aim 3: Design and implement a pulmonary E-consult-First intervention.
Methods: Aim 1 will use semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives on how e-consults impact
interpersonal relationships and how patients and providers develop high quality relationships in the context of
frequent e-consult use. Aim 2 will use a multi-step process with Delphi panels and Veteran focus groups to
develop consensus on essential components of pulmonary e-consult communication. Aim 3 will: (A) apply a
novel implementation strategy using social network analysis to identify influential individuals who can act as
change agents; (B) work with these individuals and other local stakeholders to adapt information from Aims 1
and 2 to develop an e-consult intervention; and (C) evaluate the effect of the intervention and implementation
strategy by conducting interviews to assess implementation outcomes, interrupted time-series analysis to
examine wait times, and patient and provider surveys on satisfaction and the quality of coordination.
Expected results: The proposed research will identify evidence-based practices to build and maintain patient
and provider relationships that support e-consult use and establish new communication norms. These findings
will inform the design and implementation of a successful e-consult intervention grounded in RC Theory that
will be highly transferrable and adaptable to local contexts.
Conclusions: Informatics interventions that consider humanistic elements of relationships and communication
will lead to better healthcare delivery. Research on pulmonary e-consults will act as a model to improve quality
and efficiency across specialty care. Therefore, the research outlined in this proposal is highly relevant to VA
priorities of improving the timeliness of care, modernizing systems, and focusing resources more efficiently. Dr.
Rinne is supported by a robust mentoring team, strong operational partners, and an outstanding research
environment. The research and training objective described in this CDA proposal will provide him with the
necessary knowledge and skills to become a successful and independent VA investigator focused on
improving multidisciplinary coordination through novel, informatics-based interventions."
10771994,"Project Summary
Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.
Aquaporin 0 (AQP0), the most abundant membrane protein in the lens, functions as a
water channel and as an adhesive protein. Defects in AQP0 can produce cataract, as
well as have adverse effects on lens development. Despite its critical role in lens
physiology, the functions of AQP0 are not fully understood. Our proposed research
seeks to advance our understanding of how AQP0 water permeability (Pf), the exquisite
control of which is required to maintain lens clarity, is regulated by Ca2+ and protons,
whose concentrations depend on the AQP0 location within the lens. The proposed
studies also seek to identify the amino acid residues that are crucial for Pf regulation and
for the adhesive function of AQP0, through protein-protein and/or protein-membrane
interactions, and to determine the effects of genetic modifications of AQP0 on lens
physiology and development. To these ends, we will employ a tightly coupled, multi-
disciplinary approach, unique within the field of aquaporin research, which employs
techniques ranging in scale from the atomic/molecular to the cellular and organismal
level. Specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to use in vitro Xenopus oocyte permeability
measurements on a panel of mammalian and fish AQP0 mutants to assess the
contribution of particular residues to AQP0 Pf and its regulation, along with adhesion
assays on lens fiber cells from zebrafish containing wild-type and mutant Aqp0s. These
experimental approaches will be complemented in Aim 1 with in silico multi-µs molecular
dynamics simulations, validated by comparison with experimental Pf measurements, to
elucidate mechanistic aspects of the influence of Ca2+ via calmodulin binding, pH,
including the effects of a variety of strategically chosen mutations on the Pf of
mammalian and fish AQP0s. The computer simulations proposed in Aim 1 will also
address the relative role of protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions in the
adhesive function of AQP0. Aim 2 will use genetically modified zebrafish to determine
how AQP0 contributes to the structure and function of the lens and its development in
vivo. Our work will improve understanding of lens physiology and the molecular
mechanisms of water channel gating and its regulation by Ca2+ and pH, and uncover
fundamental principles that could inform the future development of therapeutic strategies
for delaying or eliminating cataract formation."
10750951,"ABSTRACT
 The objective of this proposal is to create and validate a minimally-invasive Magnetic Resonance (MR) -
compatible concentric tube robot for Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) evacuation. About 1 in 50 people suffer
from ICH in their lifetime. ICH occurs when blood leaked from a ruptured vessel accumulates and forms a
blood clot (hematoma) in the cerebrum. The 30-day mortality for ICH is about 40% with half of all deaths
occurring in the acute phase, especially in the first 48 hours. Blood spilled outside of the intracranial vessels is
toxic to surrounding neurons, causing inflammation and perihematomal edema seen as early as 12-24 hours
after hemorrhage. These deleterious effects motivate emergent treatment to save at-risk brain tissue. We
propose three specific aims as follows.
 Specific Aim 1: Create the Robot. We will optimize the current robot prototype design to construct a new,
compact, and precise MRI-compatible robot to deploy the aspiration cannula within the MRI scanner. We will
develop the robot path planning algorithm and embedded electronics to enable accurate robot control.
 Specific Aim 2: Enable Image Guidance. We will track the aspiration cannula in MRI space by integrating
wireless MRI microcoils on the cannula. Real-time MRI will allow the surgeon to monitor the cannula position
and hematoma-brain boundary during the procedure. We will create a navigation workstation to control the
robot, enable treatment monitoring including diffusion tensor imaging, and provide a virtual boundary to
enhance safety.
 Specific Aim 3: Experimental Validation. We will first characterize robot targeting accuracy and its path-
following ability in the benchtop environment. We will then perform phantom studies in a 3T MRI scanner to
evaluate system accuracy and optimize the navigation workstation. We will conclude with four sheep studies to
evaluate the system with realistic tissue properties, perfusion, and other relevant biological effects. We will
collect robot accuracy data, quantify hematoma evacuation percentage, and determine damage to healthy
brain tissue."
10753548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is said that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the single greatest unmet need in
cardiovascular medicine. Patients with HFpEF are uniquely predisposed to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common
rhythm disturbance that is associated with worse clinical outcomes. In other words, AF and HFpEF co-segregate,
substantially exacerbate one another, and represent a prevalent and unique clinical challenge without effective
therapies.
 Metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, are common comorbidities for both HFpEF
and AF, suggesting that metabolic disturbance serves as a common mechanism underlying both conditions.
 We recently developed and validated a uniquely informative murine model of HFpEF and unveiled
mechanisms never reported previously in heart disease. These animals are predisposed to AF, just as are
patients with HFpEF. Further, we have collected preliminary data revealing that AMPK signaling is impaired in
the atria of these mice and is associated with atrial remodeling similar to changes observed in HFpEF patients.
If confirmed, this is a novel mechanism of disease-triggered AF, one that does not involve tissue fibrosis, etc.
 Here, we propose to test the central hypothesis that impaired AMPK signaling contributes to pathological
atrial remodeling in HFpEF, and modulating this pathway will attenuate atrial pathology and AF predisposition in
HFpEF.
 Specifically, we will delineate the role of AMPK in HFpEF-associated atrial structural and electrical remodeling,
focusing on atrial myocyte hypertrophy, Cx40-mediated atrial myocyte communication, and HCN4-mediated
ectopic automaticity. In a translational aim, we will determine the effect of AMPK activation on attenuating atrial
remodeling and AF predisposition"
10733425,"SUMMARY STATEMENT: In humans and other vertebrates, motile cilia located in an organ of asymmetry
play an important role in cardiac left-right development. Evidence from model organisms, such as in zebrafish
organ of asymmetry, (Kupffer’s Vesicle, KV) indicates that conserved cilia-driven leftward flow establishes left-
right signals to regulate target genes to control asymmetric heart morphogenesis. While events downstream of
leftward flow have received much attention, little is known about how the organ of asymmetry is formed and the
biology of the ciliated cells that generate fluid flow. This project addresses the broad question: How do ciliated
cells develop into a functional polarized organ? To address this question we are bringing together cell biology
and developmental biology to investigate how the cytokinetic bridge establishes apical polarity and a lumen in
vivo. We propose that this occurs through a sequential process that starts with cell division and placement of
the cytokinetic midbody, which marks a site for where the apical membrane should be placed. Cytokinetic
bridge resolution (a.k.a. abscission) results in the separation of two daughter cells following mitosis allowing for
the cell to initiate ciliogenesis. This process has important implications in embryogenesis, and broad
implications in the role of cytokinesis in developing cellular diversity. While abscission has been examined in
vitro, little has been done to examine the role of cytokinesis/abscission in epithelial establishment and de novo
lumen formation in vivo. Thus, our work will test the overall hypothesis that cell division is an essential
process that initiates lumen formation, ciliogenesis, and subsequently tissue morphogenesis. Here we propose
to examine in the zebrafish KV a requirement for abscission in the transition of progenitor-mesenchymal-like
migratory cells to epithelial-ciliated cells (tested in Aim 1). For instance, does cell division trigger KV-specific
apical polarity protein expression and does division contribute to how cells are patterned to form a KV? We
propose that following cytokinesis, daughter cells stay interconnected by a cytokinetic bridge while apical
polarity is established. This process requires targeted membrane traffic into the cytokinetic bridge. During this
time, the two daughter cells position themselves so that the cytokinetic bridge is placed where an apical
membrane and lumen will form. Once the bridge is cleaved, a lumen is initiated (Aim 2) and KV cells can form
primary cilia (Aim 3). We will use photoconversion to track cell fate following division, and laser ablation or
optogenetics to determine whether abscission timing is important for apical polarity, cilia formation, and
lumenogenesis. These studies will identify important mechanisms for de novo tissue morphogenesis."

and free of AIDS-related morbidity and death. To this end, we are committed to accelerate progress over the
next seven years to: 1) develop a globally effective HIV vaccine, a combination broad neutralizing antibody
immunoprophylaxis regimen that can prevent HIV, and an improved vaccine regimen to prevent Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection; and 2) discover novel and improved therapies that can effectively treat all persons living
with HIV, prevent HIV disease and its co-morbidities, and lead to sustained viral remission without the need for
ongoing treatment. In this renewal application for NIAID funding in 2020-2027, our CTU proposes continued
support of the scientific priorities of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the HIV Adult Therapeutic
Network (ACTG), through our three existing and highly integrated Clinical Research Sites (CRSs): the Seattle
Vaccine Trials Unit (HVTN site), the Lausanne Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center (HVTN site) and the
University of Washington AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (ACTG site).
Our CTU is operating in a productive and intense period of clinical research on behalf of the networks, and we
anticipate a seamless transition from our current portfolio to the proposed new studies initiated in the next cycle.
Our CTU leaders and co-investigators are valuable members of the networks’ leadership and scientific
committees; they chair and participate in high profile first-in-human studies and bring innovative designs to gain
insights into the mechanisms by which candidate vaccines and novel therapeutics achieve their desired
responses. Furthermore, our CRSs will continue to enroll and follow target populations in clinical trials and
contribute outstanding data to advance promising immune-based, antiviral, and other therapeutic strategies.
To achieve our vision and address the networks’ priorities, in Aim 1 we will harness the collective, diverse
expertise of three internationally recognized thought leaders in the HIV field to provide scientific leadership and
innovation to the HVTN and ACTG. In parallel, our CTU will advance the research careers, leadership skills and
opportunities for early-stage physician scientists to foster the next generation of network investigators. In Aim 2,
our governance and administrative structure will provide a transparent process for decision-making and effective
oversight of communication, resource allocation, pharmacy, clinical and regulatory operations, and quality
management to enable a highly integrated, productive CTU. In partnership with the HVTN and ACTG, in Aim 3
our three CRSs will conduct phase 1-4 clinical trials with the CTU support necessary to ensure the highest quality
standards. In Aim 4, we will continue to involve our community partners to ensure their input and support, and
to optimize enrollment and engagement of relevant populations in our clinical research activities. Importantly, we
have the necessary resource commitments from our three institutions as needed to carry out this agenda and
will leverage specialized expertise in our rich environment to foster diversity and innovation."

Coordinating Core for the PPG and all of its components. This PPG includes outstanding scientists within the
Versiti's BRI and in Richmond, Virginia and Buffalo, New York that are tightly focused on the biology of glycans
in blood and mechanisms causing myeloproliferative disease. The Administrative Core will provide coordinated,
centralized support for the participants of the Program, including the Project Leaders and Core Directors. Aim 1

handle all fiscal and administrative coordination with NIH. Aim 2 Core A will schedule the periodic (monthly)
conference video calls between Project Leaders and Core Directors, research in progress meetings, in-person
meetings held at the Versiti BRI, Virginia Commonwealth University, or Roswell Park Cancer Institute and to
coordinate the “Great Lakes Translational Glycomics Symposium” Series. Aim 3 is to provide a central site to
manage an online database of de-identified human samples and acquired data. These administrative functions
will be carried out under the direct supervision of the Principal Investigator, who is also Director of the
Translational Glycomics Center at Versiti's BRI."
10754879,"Core B - Project Summary/Abstract
This Program Project will investigate the mechanisms by which glycosylation and glycans may alter the function,
maintenance, differentiation, and overall function of hematopoietic cells. The PPG's approach towards these
questions is to find correlations between the glycosylation state of cells, their proteoglycan repertoire, their
biological responses to injury, and their gene expression programs in model system with altered function of two
key glycosylation enzymes, i.e. ST6Gal1 and β4Gal1T1. The Glycogenomics Core (Core B) will support this
effort by characterizing the gene expression program in various models via sequencing of RNA. The three
Specific Aims of this Core are (Aim 1) to generate and sequence a large number of cDNA libraries derived from
bulk RNA samples isolated from a large pool of cells; (Aim 2) to generate and sequence cDNA libraries from
single cells, and (Aim 3) to conduct the computational processing, initial analysis, and curation of sequencing
data."
10754883,"Core C – Project Summary/Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear O-linked polysaccharides that modify serine residues for a select number
of membrane proteins (e.g., glypicans: GPC1-GPC6, syndecans: SDC1-SDC4), secretory proteins (serglycin),
and extracellular proteins (e.g., perlecan). GAGs are synthesized in a non-template directed fashion producing
large heterogeneous structures that cannot be predicted in an analogous way that we can use the genome to
predict transcriptional (RNA) and translational (proteins) structures/sequences. Consequently these structures
are exceedingly difficult to structurally characterize. Furthermore, assigning biological function to these structures
such as protein-GAG interactions adds to the glycoanalytical challenges. High-performance mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) combined with advanced sample preparation strategies is the leading technology for structural
characterization and quantification of GAG structures. The Proteoglycomics-Core C (PG-Core C) fills a critical
technologically need for the Program Project which have been outlined in three Specific Aims. In SPECIFIC AIM
1, the PG-Core C will perform comparative structural analysis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate
glycosaminoglycans derived from the bone marrow niche. This aim, which we have termed GAGomics, will
provide a global measure of GAG modifications, cellular regulation, and protein-GAG interactions for all three
Projects. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, the PG-Core C will perform in-depth proteomics analysis of protein-GAG
interactions in the bone marrow niche which we've termed GAGactomics or the identification of proteins that
differentially bind cellular or extracellular GAG structures. In SPECIFIC AIM 3, or the aim focused solely on
Proteomics, the PG-Core C will perform global and targeted quantitative proteomics analysis of protein
expression in the bone marrow niche. Our overall goal is to support the innovative hypotheses of all three
Projects with the highest quality LC-MS/MS data to elucidate GAG structures, GAG-protein interactions, and
protein expression levels in the bone marrow niche."
10754888,"Insufficient megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis remain the main cause of persistent thrombocytopenia after
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation and after radiochemotherapy. Platelet
transfusions are required to support patients with consequent increased risk of transfusion reactions, platelet
alloimmunization, and transfusion-associated viral infections. Significant efforts are focused on identifying the
most suitable cellular and molecular targets to enhance platelet production after bone marrow (BM)
transplantation, chemotherapy, and to maximize the efficacy of in vitro human platelet production as an
alternative method to increase the platelet supply for transfusion. Our ability to therapeutically optimize platelet
recovery and in vitro platelet production is hindered by our paucity of knowledge of the molecular determinants
that govern thrombopoiesis. Megakaryocytes (MKs) reside in the BM and maintain the continuous production of
billions of circulating platelets in order to prevent bleeding. Recent work shows that MKs also maintain a
functionally specific BM niche to support MK-biased HSPCs. Preliminary data suggest that: 1) MK-biased HSPCs
express unusually high levels of α2,6-sialic acid (α2,6-Sia) which is unparalleled by cell intrinsic St6gal1 mRNA
expression; 2) systemic ST6GAL1 deficiency promotes a myeloid skewed hematopoietic development profile,
suggesting that α2,6-sialylation is a checkpoint of a particular HSPC population (Project 2); 3) B4galt1 deletion
in MKs renders β1 integrin hyperactive and unexpectedly also regulates heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HS PG)
and heparinase expression in MKs thereby severely impairing thrombopoiesis at steady state and following
myeloablative injury; 4) Heparinase and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetics improved thrombopoiesis in wild
type and B4galt1-/- MKs, suggesting a role for GAGs in thrombopoiesis. The overarching hypothesis of this
program is that “distinct cell-intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-mediated mechanisms regulate maintenance,
differentiation, and function of hematopoietic cells”. Project 1 will test the specific hypothesis that glycosylation
regulates MK-biased HSCs and thrombopoiesis in three aims: In Aim 1, a functionally defined MK-biased
hematopoietic stem cell will be investigated together with Project 2, especially with respect to the heavily α2,6-
sialylated cell surface despite the absence of St6gal1 expression necessary to generate this structure. We will
establish the role of α2,6-Sia in MK-biased HSPCs. Based on the known requirement of the
galactosyltransferase β4GalT1 in thrombopoiesis, Project 1 will also investigate the roles of β4GalT1,
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)/HS PG in thrombopoiesis at steady-state (Aim 2) and following myeloablative
stress (Aim 3) using the novel combined shared “omics” together with Project 3 and standard approaches. A
previously unknown role of β4GalT1 to regulate MK expression of HS PG will also be investigated. This Project
will uncover new information to increase platelet production and help understand clinical conditions characterized
by MK abnormalities."
10754892,"Project 2 – Project Summary
Maintaining hematopoiesis is critical for life. Generating the proper numbers of functional blood cells across all
lineages requires cell-intrinsic developmental programs, but these programs require guidance from cell-extrinsic
mechanisms that correctly convey the physiologic needs for these cells. Glycans on the cell surface and in the
extracellular milieu reside at the interphase through which the cell-extrinsic cues are conveyed. The overarching
Program Hypothesis is that cell-intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-mediated mechanisms regulate maintenance,
differentiation, and function of hematopoietic cells.
Glycosyltransferases such as the sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 are also residents of the extracellular milieu. Our
preliminary data point to a role for the extracellular, or extrinsic ST6GAL1, and possibly other
glycosyltransferases in the marrow to influence hematopoietic decisions on multiple levels of blood cell
development. Outside of the marrow, platelets upon activation release the sialic acid donor substrate required
to drive extrinsic sialyltransferase catalysis. Together with Project 1, we will explore the idea that
megakaryocytes, the precursors of platelets, control marrow extrinsic sialylation by a similar mechanism.
Together with Project 3, we have uncovered a totally unexpected interaction between glycosaminoglycan
components of the extracellular matrix with ST6GAL1, and we have identified a number of GAG-mimetics with
striking ability to modulate extrinsic ST6GAL1 sialylation on target cells.
Disturbed hematopoiesis with highly heterogenous presentation and varied underlying driver mutations is the
defining hallmark of clonal myeloid diseases such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS). However, a key common feature of MPN and MDS is dysplastic megakaryocytes with altered
circulating platelet numbers and function. Our preliminary data point to distinct glycosylation signatures
associated with platelets from patients of these diseases, suggesting fundamental alterations to the bone marrow
environment and the megakaryocytes that produce the platelets. We hypothesize that glycosylation, especially
extrinsic glycosylation, regulates blood cell homeostasis, ultimately impacting the number and function of
circulating blood cells in health and in disease. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims to 1) understand
how extrinsic ST6GAL1 regulates HSPC maintenance; 2) understand how extrinsic sialylation in the marrow is
regulated; and 3) initiate a first-time study on how glycosylation is modified in clinical MDS and MPN and in
mouse models. The proposed study is expected to yield transformative understanding of extrinsic glycosylation
in cell-niche interactions critical to maintaining blood cell production. This is also a pioneering investigation into
the glycoscience of clinical MDS and MPN, with potential for novel therapeutics and diagnostics."

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) contribute to myriad, and very often opposing, functions such as cellular
proliferation as well as apoptosis, self-renewal as well as differentiation. Yet, precious little is understood about
the exact GAG sequences that induce these functions. Of particular importance to this program project, although
GAGs are significant components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, the nuts and bolts of whether
GAGs modulate hematopoietic cell fate; whether these interactions are selective/specific; and whether GAG or
GAG-like molecules can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes remain poorly understood. This project focuses
on elucidating the GAG structure–function relationships of importance to hematopoiesis & thrombopoiesis. Three
aims are proposed including 1) Develop Technology for Elucidation of GAGactomes of Biological Samples,
especially Cells and Microenvironment of the Bone Marrow; 2) Employ the Library of Synthetic GAG Mimetics
for Modulation of Hematopoietic Outcomes; and 3) Elucidate Specificity and Function of GAG Recognition of
Sialyl Transferase ST6Gal-1. The outcomes of these aims will be the precise structure–function relationships in
GAGs that induce hematopoietic functions. Specifically with respect to hematopoiesis, the project aims to answer
the question of whether GAGs modulate hematopoietic cell fate. If so, are GAG interactions are selective? If
selective, can GAG sequences or mimetics of GAGs be harnessed as therapeutics for hematopoietic disorders?
Overall, this project contributes knowledge, tools/technology, and therapeutically promising agents in the area
of hematopoiesis and thrombopoeisis."
10756452,"Project Summary/Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a debilitating disorder that includes pervasive memory impairments that
significantly impact quality of life. In rodent models of TLE, my lab and others have found major deficits in
learning and memory as well as in the precision and stability of CA1 place cells. However, it remains unclear
whether impaired spatial coding in CA1 is primarily due to local processing deficits in hippocampus or rather is
influenced by impaired spatial coding and synchronization from upstream inputs. In fact, there is significant
evidence that upstream inputs into the hippocampus from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) may be altered in
epilepsy. This proposal will test the hypothesis that both MEC inputs into the hippocampus have altered spatial
coding and synchronization. To test this hypothesis, we will first use calcium imaging with miniature
microscopes to characterize how chronic epilepsy alters spatial coding in MECII stellate cells and MECIII
neurons, which directly input into hippocampus. Next, we will use silicon probes to record single unit firing and
LFPs simultaneously in MECII, MECIII, DG, and CA1 and determine how synchronization throughout the
entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is altered in epileptic mice. Finally, we will use excitatory and inhibitory
DREADDs to modulate MEC neurons in control and epileptic mice and determine how each input into
hippocampus alters synchronization of hippocampal circuits and spatial memory. Together, these aims will use
state-of-the-art recording and manipulation techniques to determine precisely where and how spatial coding
and synchronization breaks down in epileptic mice and gain new insights into the cause of cognitive deficits."

with plain language, visual aids, and a narrative format. We developed a culturally targeted narrative video in
Spanish for at-risk Latinas. Piloted in a single-arm trial (N=40), Latinas reported high satisfaction and exhibited
a significant increase in knowledge from pre- to post-test. Nearly all participants (95%) reported an interest in
GCT, and 62% completed genetic counseling. We will use an innovative hybrid research design that combines
elements of traditional efficacy studies as well as best practices from implementation research to enhance the
quality and speed of the translational process. Guided by an expanded Integrated Behavioral Model, we will
conduct a RCT to evaluate the efficacy of our video vs. the FORCE fact sheet on enhancing GCT uptake and
psychosocial outcomes. To maximize the potential for implementation in community clinics, we will train clinic
staff to administer the Referral Screening Tool (RST), a validated tool to identify women at-risk of HBOC. Guided
by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct an Implementation Focused
Process Evaluation to gather data on clinic implementation outcomes for use of the Referral Screening Tool and
the video. We will refer participants to free Spanish telephone genetic counseling. We will randomize 300 at-risk
Latinas at four sites with large Latinx populations. Our primary outcome is genetic counseling uptake.
Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of our video vs. fact sheet on GCT uptake. Participants in the video arm will have
higher genetic counseling uptake (H1.1.) and higher genetic testing uptake (H1.2.) at 4 months.
Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of our video vs. fact sheet on psychosocial and process evaluation outcomes. H2.1:
Video participants will have higher knowledge, positive attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and positive
anticipatory emotions. H2.2. Video participants will have higher acceptability and feasibility ratings.
Exploratory aim: Evaluate mechanisms of the video's impact on genetic counseling uptake (knowledge, attitudes,
norms, self-efficacy, anticipatory emotions). If counseling uptake does not differ by arm, then we will evaluate
predictors of uptake.
Aim 3. Examine key implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, adoption, fidelity, and future
sustainability of using the Referral Screening Tool and the video at the community clinics."
10745914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic DNA is constantly challenged by DNA damage either spontaneously induced during cellular
metabolism or generated by exogenous DNA damaging agents. During DNA replication, DNA lesions can
cause the stalling or collapse of replication forks. Fork collapse results in the formation of DNA double-strand
breaks (DSBs). MCM8 and MCM9 (MCM8-9) form a helicase complex that promotes the repair of DSBs by
homologous recombination. We recently identified MCM8IP as a novel interactor of MCM8-9 that maintains
genomic integrity after replication stress. In particular, we showed that MCM8IP promotes DSB repair by
homologous recombination, facilitates the restart of replication forks arrested by DNA lesions and protects cells
from DNA damage generated by replication stress-inducing agents. Despite these important preliminary
findings, the precise mechanisms of action exhibited by MCM8IP, MCM8 and MCM9 during DNA
recombination and replication remain to be elucidated. MCM8 or MCM9 have been reported to act as tumor
suppressors and recent cancer genomic analyses have evidenced mutations in MCM8, MCM9 and MCM8IP in
multiple cancer types. The goals of this proposal are to define the precise biochemical and cellular activities
displayed by the MCM8IP-MCM8-9 complex for suppressing genomic instability and to examine how these
activities are affected by mutations in MCM8IP, MCM8 and MCM9 identified in tumors. In particular, we
propose 1) to define the biochemical activities and physical interactions exhibited by the MCM8IP-MCM8-9
complex for preserving genomic integrity; 2) to elucidate the mechanisms by which MCM8IP-MCM8-9
promotes DSB repair and ensures replication fork progression in response to DNA damage; 3) to evaluate the
contribution of MCM8IP, MCM8 and MCM9 cancer-associated mutations to genomic instability. Our approach
will utilize innovative proteomic methods, state-of-the-art genome editing technologies, single-molecule
analyses of replication dynamics, electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging. We anticipate that our
studies will define the unique mechanisms employed by the MCM8IP-MCM8-9 complex to suppress genomic
instability and will provide insights into the potential contribution of MCM8IP, MCM8 and MCM9 cancer-
associated mutations to cancer etiology."

 The overarching goal of our Contraception Research Center (CRC) is to develop
innovative monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based contraceptive and multipurpose prevention
technology (MPT) products with the potential to improve the lives of millions of women globally
by addressing two concurrent reproductive health crises: an unacceptably high rate of unintended
pregnancies in both developing and developed countries, and an epidemic of sexually
transmissible infections (STIs). With funding from NIAID we developed a vaginal film, MB-66,
containing mAbs against HIV-1 and HSV-2 [the first components of our MPT product]. MB-66
was safe and showed good ex vivo efficacy in a Phase 1 Clinical Trial. Under our current NICHD-
funded CRC program we engineered, produced and characterized a GMP-grade human
antisperm mAb “Human Contraception Antibody (HCA)”, and ZB-06, a vaginal film containing
HCA for topical vaginal application. We obtained an exploratory IND, and are currently testing ZB-
06 in a Phase 1 Clinical Trial in women with safety and exploratory efficacy (postcoital test)
endpoints. Preliminary data from the first six women enrolled in the clinical trial indicate that ZB-
06 is safe and highly effective at preventing motile sperm from entering the endocervix, a key
correlate of contraceptive efficacy.
 We are seeking to renew our CRC program to advance ZB-06 through further clinical trials.
In Project 1, ZabBio will improve upon and scale up the production of ZB-06 for use in IND-
enabling studies, and in the proposed Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials. ZabBio will file all
paperwork required by the FDA to obtain an IND for the clinical trials, maintain the IND and
monitor the clinical trials. Project 2, to be conducted at Eastern Virginia Medical School and the
University of Texas San Antonio, will be responsible for the conduct of the two clinical trials: 1) a
Phase 1 safety and PK study of single dose vs. multiple dose application of ZB-06, and 2) a Phase
2a dose-finding study of ZB-06 film with safety and postcoital test efficacy endpoints. Project 3,
based at Boston University School of Medicine and Magee-Women’s Research Institute, will
improve upon the vaginal film design, and conduct essential safety studies to support the clinical
trials. An Administrative Core will provide leadership and fiscal management for all projects, and
database and statistical support for the clinical trials. By the end of the project we expect that ZB-
06 will be positioned for Phase 2b contraceptive efficacy testing by the NIH Contraceptive Trials
Network."
10744231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Translating ribosomes often encounter obstacles that stop them in their tracks: the synthesis of
roughly 1 out of every 250 proteins in E. coli ends in failure. Ribosome rescue factors clear stalled
ribosomes from truncated or chemically damaged mRNAs, releasing the subunits so that they can be
used again. The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms by which rescue factors
such as tmRNA recognize stalled ribosomes without interfering with ribosomes engaged in productive
translation. For over a decade, the consensus has been that ribosome rescue factors act on truncated
mRNAs. Biochemical and structural studies indicate that tmRNA selectively reacts with ribosomes where
the mRNA tunnel downstream of the ribosomal A site is empty. Yet other critical features of the
recognition of stalled ribosomes may have been missed. A new paradigm has emerged in eukaryotes
where stalling leads to ribosome collisions and the formation of a new interface between the small
subunits of collided ribosomes. This interface is recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers
downstream quality control events on the mRNA. The interactions between the small subunits of bacterial
ribosomes in crystal lattices resemble those in collided eukaryotic disomes. Moreover, theoretical models
suggest that collisions play a role in lowering protein output when stalling occurs in E. coli. At present,
however, there is no direct evidence that collisions promote ribosome rescue in bacteria. We have
obtained new data using reporter mRNAs loaded with different ribosome densities that show that
ribosome collisions are required for tmRNA to rescue ribosomes stalled in the middle of an mRNA.
Furthermore, we can purify these complexes and study their composition and structure: treating cells with
an antibiotic that stalls ribosomes generates collided disomes that are nuclease-resistant. Building on
these key findings, in Aim 1 we describe unbiased approaches to identify factors that recognize stalled
ribosomes, including mass spectrometry of nuclease-resistant disomes and genetic selections against
ribosome rescue. In Aim 2, we will use ribosome profiling to follow pausing, collisions, and rescue in vivo,
asking how these phenomena change in the absence of tmRNA and novel rescue factors. Because
collisions are difficult to detect in ensemble assays, we will develop single-molecule FRET methods to
observe collisions and their effects on the binding kinetics of ribosome rescue factors. In addition, we will
determine the structure of bacterial collided disomes (and associated factors of interest). Together, these
studies will provide a comprehensive view of the role of collisions in ribosome rescue in bacteria."
10703415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Racial disparity in stroke-related care remains among the most compelling health service concerns in the United
States. Stroke patients account for about 20% of all inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions. However,
there is limited research to date exploring patient-centered outcomes associated with the quality and intensity of
IRF-based rehabilitation services among stroke patients who are racial/ethnic minorities and are dual eligible for
Medicare and Medicaid. Our proposal uses an integrative mixed methods design to study how individual- and
provider-level factors contribute to disparities in IRF quality rating and amount of therapy, and subsequently, the
combined effect of the two on patient health outcomes. The qualitative aim will identify facilitators and barriers
to IRF selection among racial/ethnic minorities and those with dual eligiblility after stroke and the impact of the
selection of quality IRFs on patient perceptions of IRF quality of care.
This study will use 100% Medicare claims and assessment data (2017-2022), and perspectives from
patients/caregivers, hospital discharge planners, and rehabilitation clinicians from different regions to understand
selection processes of IRF and outcomes. We will utilize the Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytical File,
Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Patient Assessment Instrument, Provider of Service, and
publicly available IRF Medicare compare data. Patients with ‘index stroke’ admitted directly to IRFs from acute
hospitals will serve as our primary cohort. For the first three aims, a) change in functional status, b) 30-day
hospital readmission, and c) community discharge will serve as primary outcomes, adjusting for patient-,
hospital-, and market-level characteristics. For the fourth, qualitative aim, patient perception of IRF quality and
perceived functional recovery will be primary dependent variables for assessing the impact of disparities in
rehabilitation care."

The Case Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) comprises three highly productive clinical research sites: Case/UHC in
Cleveland, the University of Cincinnati, and the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala. Each of these
three sites is a top performing ACTG treatment trial site with excellent accruals, outstanding performance
evaluations and major roles in the leadership of the network and it is scientific productivity. A key theme of
this CTU is the close link of our clinical research portfolio with our basic and translational research
programs. Thus, the three CRS sites of the Case CTU bring a comprehensive research plan to the
enterprise. Led by faculty who are national and international leaders in their fields, these units are poised
to make substantive contributions to each of the priority areas targeted by the ACTG: Inflammation/End
Organ Disease, Antiretroviral Medications, HIV Eradication and Cure, Tuberculosis, and Hepatitis. The
Case/UHC CRS has also been a productive member of the HVTN. The Case/UHC CRS has been a high-
performing site in this network, having enrolled participants, including some from difficult-to-reach segments
of the population, into multiple HVTN trials during this funding cycle. In some cases, enrollment has
substantially exceeded expectations from the site. Additionally, Case CTU investigators are highly
accomplished researchers who have extensive experience in the monitoring of immune responses form
immunization, in evaluating diverse immunization strategies to enhance vaccine responsiveness, and in
the use of vaccine responsiveness as a readout of immune competence. The University of Cincinnati CRS
is a highly efficient, well-managed CRS that has been conducting clinical and translational research for the
ACTG since 1987, and is the number 1 site by number of participants enrolled in the US. In addition to their
extraordinary performance on enrollments, the site has extensive accumulated expertise in the metabolic
complications of HIV, and is additionally a high-performing protocol-specific HPTN site. The JCRC is one
of the top-performing international sites in the ACTG, and is the critical component in the contributions of
the Case CTU to the tuberculosis agenda. It is also the site of the first hepatitis C treatment clinical trial in
Africa, the ACTG A5360 protocol. The JCRC CRS has also previously demonstrated its ability to access
large numbers of subjects in well-defined populations at high risk for HIV infection, having been the site of
the first HIV vaccine trial in Africa, and can begin contributing to the HIV prevention networks immediately
as well if selected as a site. Thus, the three CRS that comprise this CTU are positioned to provide sustained
leadership and contribution to the treatment and prevention agenda of the NIAID Networks."
10749901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application to RFA-AI-19-002 is to continue as the statistical and data management center (SDMC) for the
HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). The overarching goal of the HPTN is to identify acceptable, feasible,
safe, effective, and scalable interventions for HIV prevention that address the needs of populations at risk in the
US and around the world. The HPTN will address this goal through identifying: 1) new biomedical products and
tools for HIV prevention that have unique characteristics, such as longer duration of action, new targets of HIV
inhibition or as multi-purpose technologies; 2) integrated strategies that optimize use of proven efficacious
prevention interventions tailored to specific populations at risk to achieve maximal public health impact.
The HPTN SDMC is housed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and takes advantage of
the particular strengths of the institution, which also includes the HVTN SDMC, and data and coordinating centers
for several other research networks. The HPTN SDMC has faculty biostatisticians experienced in the design,
conduct and analysis of global HIV prevention studies, who support the goals of HPTN research through
leadership in statistical design, trial conduct and analysis, and development and implementation of innovative
statistical methods as needed and motivated by HPTN scientific goals. The SDMC provides regulatory compliant
data management functions for all HPTN trials, including electronic data capture directly from research sites,
integration of laboratory specimens and assay results, and electronic participant reported outcomes.
During the grant period, the SDMC will design and analyze Phase 1-3 trials of both antiretroviral and broadly
neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bNAb) products, including completion of two Phase 3 active-controlled
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) and two Phase 3 placebo-controlled RCTs
of the bNAb VRC-01. The SDMC will fully support the development pathway for multi-purpose technologies,
encompassing both acceptability and user-based design. If CAB LA proves efficacious, it will be incorporated
into integrated strategy trials for populations at risk. Trial designs for integrated strategies will range from
individual-randomized, to cluster-randomized (either parallel or step-wedge), to non-randomized trials,
depending on the context and population. Mathematical modeling will estimate the population impact and cost-
effectiveness of successful HPTN interventions in specific populations at risk.
The SDMC will continue to deliver high-quality, timely, cost-efficient, and secure data management and safety
monitoring functions for HPTN trials. State-of-the-art systems for data acquisition, storage, quality control,
curation, and annotation, will be compliant with Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and
maintained using a continuous quality improvement strategy. HPTN socio-behavioral research is supported
through flexible data interface processes with external data sources including mobile apps, SMS, tablets, and
electronic Patient Reported Outcomes."
10745699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV is the epidemic of our time; South Africa is its epicenter. Current interventions are denting the epidemic but
are unlikely to achieve the UNAIDS goal of ending HIV by 2030. In South Africa, new infections continue: in
2018, 240 000 new infections added to the 7.7 million South Africans living with HIV. South Africa has the
largest ARV program in the world, but treatment as prevention has not stalled new infections. Although
progress has been made in controlling pediatric HIV, we have yet to meet the Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) elimination targets. The significant TB burden amongst people living with HIV
destabilizes TB control efforts. Taken together, these realities underscore the need to find effective biomedical
interventions to prevent HIV, address the long-term management of HIV throughout the age spectrum, and
investigate HIV remission. Ongoing research investment is vital to our attempt to achieve epidemic control.
NIH-sponsored research has led to vital advances in both treatment and prevention. Our proposed PHRU-
Setshaba Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), with seven Clinical Research Sites (CRS), is strategically positioned in
high HIV prevalence and incidence geographic hotspots. Our access to informal settlements, maternity units,
TB clinics and hospitals enables the CTU to investigate the prevention and control of HIV and TB. Our PHRU-
Setshaba CTU has the long-term objective to support the scientific agenda of the four NIH HIV/AIDS Clinical
Trials Networks to reduce the impact of HIV and TB on infants, children, adolescents and adults. Our CTU
comprises of internationally renowned scientists, based in South Africa, predominantly women, from diverse
racial and ethnic backgrounds, with a track record of capacity development. To contribute to the scientific
agenda of the NIH HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks, the CTU intends to: 1) evaluate novel active HIV
vaccination strategies that may be efficacious by inducing non-neutralizing vaccine immune responses; 2)
evaluate passive neutralization utilizing one or more monoclonal antibodies for biomedical prevention; 3)
investigate the role of alternatives to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis such as long-acting antiretrovirals and
multi-purpose prevention technologies; 4) assess HIV vaccines to prevent breastmilk transmission of HIV; 5)
contribute to finding HIV treatment options that reduce long-term side-effects in both adults and children; 6)
support research into HIV remission and 7) to contribute to the TB research agenda for TB prevention and
therapeutics. We aim to achieve this by operating an efficient CTU that will oversee the execution of quality
clinical research which is regulatory and ethically compliant, in partnership with our communities, as well as by
developing a successor generation of diverse scientists."
10738767,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: GHESKIO is a Haitian organization dedicated to research, service, and training in
HIV/AIDS with a 37 year track record of NIH-funded clinical research. GHESKIO has two clinical sites in Port
au Prince, Haiti. The Downtown site has large HIV/TB clinics, a maternal child health center, a cardiovascular
center, and programs in adjacent slums. The North site has HIV/TB clinics, an MDR-TB hospital, and a BSL3
TB laboratory. The GHESKIO Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) has two clinical research sites (CRSs) enrolling male
and female participants across the lifespan, including pregnant women, infants, children, adolescents and
adults. The GHESKIO CTU will continue to participate in two networks: Adult HIV/AIDS Therapeutic Trials
(ACTG) and Maternal, Adolescent, Pediatric therapeutics (IMPAACT). We propose the following three aims:
1. Operate a single organization (GHESKIO) CTU with two research sites that is integrated, cohesive,
and able to respond rapidly to a breadth of emerging research priorities. The CTU will maximize
efficiency by having a single research component for administration, communication, evaluation, community
liaison, data management, regulatory assurance, quality management, and training program. Each CRS has its
own pharmacy. The main laboratory is at GHESKIO-North and the downtown site has a satellite laboratory.
2. Conduct adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic trials at GHESKIO-Downtown and GHESKIO-North - ACTG: Haiti
has the highest HIV prevalence in the hemisphere with 2.0% of adults HIV infected. Both GHESKIO sites
(Downtown, North) have large HIV-infected adult ART naïve and ART-experienced cohorts available for
recruitment into trials. Haiti also has the highest rates of TB with a prevalence of 1,066/100,000 in Port au
Prince. GHESKIO treats ~ 2,000 TB patients annually including patients with MDR-TB who are available for
enrollment into TB treatment trials. GHESKIO has established a new cardiovascular disease research unit to
study the chronic complications of HIV.
3. Conduct maternal, adolescent, and pediatric HIV/AIDS trials at GHESKIO-Downtown- IMPAACT:
GHESKIO-Downtown has the expertise, research capacity, and populations for trials of new antiretroviral drugs
in children, adolescents and pregnant women. GHESKIO pediatricians identify and enroll HIV-infected
newborns for trials of intensive therapy to induce an ART free remission. GHESKIO investigators are leaders in
PK studies of TB drugs in children and pregnant women. We will be leading a trial evaluating one month
isoniazid/rifapentine prophylaxis in pregnant women. GHESKIO will introduce studies on nutritional
interventions in pregnant women and newborns to improve their growth and neurologic development."
10752702,"Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma and traumatic and other optic neuropathies results in
permanent partial or complete blindness. Molecular mechanisms that may oppose this RGC death remain an
area of active investigation and potential high impact, as bridging RGC survival in chronic optic neuropathies
has high potential to preserve or restore vision. Multiple signal transduction pathways have been implicated
in RGC neuroprotection, including cAMP and neurotrophic factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways. How these pathways synergistically promote RGC survival and elicit their
downstream effects remains unknown. Recent data from our labs support a model in which signalosomes
organized by the perinuclear scaffold protein muscle A-Kinase Anchoring Protein α (mAKAPα/AKAP6α)
mediate cAMP-dependent signaling and potentiate neuroprotective MAPK signaling, resulting in Ets
Like-1 protein (Elk-1) transcription factor activation and RGC survival. The identification of this intracellular
cAMP signaling compartment specifically relevant to neuroprotection provides a mechanism for spatially distinct
cAMP action and should inform the design of strategies providing therapeutic specificity greater than global
cAMP elevation with adenylyl cyclase activators or cAMP analogs. In this application, we propose three Specific
Aims to test this model and to elucidate the mechanism conferring the synergy between cAMP and neurotrophic
factor signaling in neuroprotection. Specific Aim 1: Defining Neuroprotective Gene Expression. Using single-
cell RNA transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq), we will study to what degree similar gene transcription
programs are induced by different neuroprotective interventions, including generalized versus
compartmentalized cAMP elevation, determine whether individual RGC subtypes are preferentially regulated by
cAMP and neurotrophic factor signaling, and identify gene candidates whose altered expression may be critical
for neuroprotection in response to therapeutic intervention. Specific Aim 2: Role of Perinuclear
Compartmented cAMP Signaling in RGC Neuroprotection. Using new tools to promote or inhibit cAMP and
Ca2+ in special intracellular compartments, we will test whether Ca2+-cAMP signaling at RGC mAKAPα
signalosomes is uniquely sufficient and/or necessary for RGC neuroprotection after optic nerve crush. Specific
Aim 3: Crosstalk Between cAMP- and Neurotrophic Factor-Dependent RGC Neuroprotection. To test
whether cAMP and neurotrophic factors promote neuroprotection through co-regulation of ERK1/2-dependent
Elk-1 activation, mice with gain- and loss-of-function for Elk-1 in RGCs will be subjected to optic nerve crush and
compared for their response to additional treatment with exogenous neurotrophic factors and AAV-mediated
mAKAPα signaling compartment enhancement. Together, these Specific Aims will provide molecular insights
into the signaling pathways and the altered gene expression that can confer RGC neuroprotection in vivo, while
providing proof-of-concept for new strategies to prevent loss of vision in RGC disease."
10746804,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nociceptor neurons are peripheral sensory neurons that densely innervate the gastrointestinal tract, detecting
noxious/harmful stimuli to mediate protective neural reflexes including pain. However, the role of nociceptor
neurons or their molecular mediators in regulating gut physiology, barrier protection, and host defense is not
well understood. Here we hypothesize that specific gut-innervating nociceptors signal to epithelial cells to
modulate gut barrier defenses at homeostasis and during bacterial invasion. Our preliminary data show that
nociceptor neurons and the nociceptor neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signal to intestinal
goblet cells and microfold (M) cells, two types of gut epithelial cells that mediate barrier protection and host
defenses. Recent molecular phenotyping of DRG neurons show that multiple types of nociceptors innervate
the gut. In this project, we will utilize targeted genetic and molecular approaches to: 1) Determine whether
Nav1.8+ nociceptor neurons or their specific subsets (CGRP+, MRGPRD+) are necessary for maintenance of
gut epithelial cell function during homeostasis, and barrier protection against the enteric pathogens Salmonella
Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium; 2) Determine whether chemogenetic (DREADD) or dietary ligand
activation of nociceptor neurons is sufficient to induce changes in gut epithelial cells and barrier function; 3)
Define the role of the nociceptor neuropeptide CGRP-RAMP1 axis in regulating barrier epithelial (goblet cells,
M cells) and immune cells in modulating barrier host defenses. We aim to use innovative and interdisciplinary
approaches from neurobiology, gastroenterology, and immunology to interrogate the role of nociceptor neurons
in gut barrier function and enteric host defense. The team includes experts in nociceptor neurons and
neuroimmunology (Chiu lab), and gut microbial and immune responses (Huh lab). A role for the nervous
system in regulating gastrointestinal barrier defenses could lead to novel approaches to treat autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases. A greater understanding of how neurons signal to epithelial cells and immune cells the
gastrointestinal tract could lead to novel insights in tissue barrier homeostasis. Our findings could also have
relevance to disease conditions where gut barrier dysfunction occur such as autoimmune or inflammatory
diseases. Targeting neurons or CGRP signaling could therefore lead to novel approaches to enhance barrier
integrity to treat gastrointestinal diseases."

primarily targeting triple-negative breast cancer, with integrated guidance from patient advocates, to ensure
that we are inclusive of the patient perspective in meeting our goals. The projects are as follows: Project 2 -
Strategies to Improve Outcomes for TNBC Patients Integrating Subtype-specific Genomic and Immune-based
Discoveries; Project 4 - Targeting Antigen Presentation to Improve Immunotherapy Responses in Breast
Cancer; and Project 5 – Liquid Biopsies to Guide Therapies in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers. The projects
require three highly integrated shared core resources: Administration and Engagement, Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics, and Pathology and Tissue Informatics. The cores bring innovative technology, resources, and
personnel with project-specific expertise to the overall VICC Breast SPORE Program and do not duplicate pre-
existing shared resources available at VICC or Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). We have an
expert multidisciplinary team that will accomplish the proposed aims and continue to have productive
translational collaborations with other Breast Cancer Programs, SPOREs, and national and international
groups."
10740855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is the leading cause of death with very limited treatment options. This devastating neurological disease
is increasingly viewed as a disease of brain connectivity as a damaged stroke area can affect both local and
connected brain regions, causing disruptions in neuronal activity and metabolism network-wide. Recovery of
lost function can occur after stroke and is attributed to brain remodeling in areas adjacent to or connected to
the infarct. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the role of key brain circuits in post-stroke recovery at the
functional, cellular and molecular level, using optogenetics, advanced live imaging and high throughput RNA
sequencing techniques. Previously our lab has demonstrated that selective optogenetic neuronal stimulation in
the ipsilesional motor cortex (iM1) can activate plasticity mechanisms and promote recovery. Recently we have
employed the optogenetic functional MRI technique to systematically map brain-wide changes in neural circuits
after stroke. We have identified key circuits altered by stroke and demonstrated two key circuits restored by
iM1 stimulations. Our map data also revealed two candidate circuits that were not restored by iM1 stimulations,
suggesting that greater recovery could be achieved if we can rescue these circuits by directly stimulating them.
In this proposal we aim to investigate key neural circuits we identified from our activation maps and elucidate
their role in post-stroke recovery. In Aim1 we will use circuit-specific optogenetic tools and functional behavior
tests to interrogate the role of key circuits in post-stroke recovery. This aim will address whether these circuits
have beneficial or maladaptive role during post-stroke recovery. In Aim2 we will examine cellular resolution of
real-time neuronal activity dynamics in key circuits after stroke using a portable live calcium imaging system.
This will elucidate the neural activity dynamics (excitatory and inhibitory) of key circuits at the cellular level,
allowing us to identify the temporal profile and the key neuronal populations altered by stroke, and how iM1
stimulations affect these characteristics to enhance recovery. In Aim3 we will investigate the transcriptome of
key circuit areas using RNAseq, in order to identify key molecular targets and pathways altered by stroke and
by iM1 stimulations. Preliminary RNAseq analysis revealed distinct pathways altered by iM1 stimulations. We
aim to perform RNAseq in multiple regions including iM1 (stimulation site) and ipsilesional thalamus (iM1-
connected region) to elucidate whether similar pathways are involved, and if we can identify a common
molecular signature that drive recovery. We will also perform RNAseq in both sexes in order to ascertain any
sex-specific differences that may be present in post-stroke recovery. Together these results will 1) advance the
understanding of neural circuit dynamics during post-stroke recovery; and 2) identify key neural circuits/cell
types/molecular targets and optimal time window for designing brain stimulation strategies and other
therapeutic interventions in future clinical studies."

Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an
independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk
prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of
health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead
by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at
Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng,
an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has
contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr.
Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses
on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4)
career development.
Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the
Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members
from K awards to R01 awards.
Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk
stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project
utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic
HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units
located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association
between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to
identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to
create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and
social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research
leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and
hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for
identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets
the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of
EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality."

turnover of ion channels and receptors, and c) degenerate and multiple solutions at the
single neuron and circuit level. These questions arise from years of computational and
experimental work using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion
(STG), but address general problems relevant to all nervous systems, from invertebrates
to humans. Future experiments will combine experimental and computational work to
understand the correlations in biological parameters in neurons and networks that allow
any given parameter to be variable while the circuit itself retains robustness. Animal to
animal variability in response to perturbations will be measured, the strengths of all of
the synapses in STG circuits will be measured, and the regulation of multiple
neuromodulator receptors by single neurons will be studied. Additionally, self-tuning
models will be developed to find sets of neuronal parameters that allow neurons to
maintain stability in response to perturbations. This work will illuminate the extent to
which the same animal can potentially generate similar behavior by substantially
different (degenerate) circuit mechanisms at different times. If so, this can shed light on
how larger circuits may switch between a number of degenerate circuit mechanisms to
generate stable behaviors over time."

The emergence of complex tissue patterns from seemingly uniform, undifferentiated cells during
development is an essential feature of all multicellular organisms. One of the most prominent theoretical
mechanisms often invoked to explain biological pattern formation is the reaction-diffusion (RD) model, which
postulates that local activation of pattern differentiation factors combined with long-range inhibition of the
activity of those factors can produce dynamic, self-organizing spatial patterns. Numerous empirical and
simulation studies have suggested that the RD mechanism underlies a wide range of pattern formation
processes. However, we still know very little about the actual genes encoding the hypothetical activation
and inhibition factors in most empirical systems, even less about the biophysical properties of these factors
where candidate genes have been identified, and virtually nothing about how modulation of the properties of
these activators and inhibitors affects pattern evolution in nature. The overall objective of this project is to
address these fundamental questions by elucidating the detailed genetic and developmental mechanisms of
pigment pattern formation and evolution in the wildflower genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a system
amenable to rigorous genetic analysis, developmental interrogation, and phenotypic perturbation. The work
proposed here will build on our prior efforts that identiﬁed a pair of MYB proteins underlying the formation of
dispersed anthocyanin pigment spots in Mimulus flowers. This MYB pair forms a local autocatalytic
feedback loop and a long-range inhibitory feedback loop, fulfilling the tenets of a classical activator-inhibitor
RD model. Our goals in the coming years are to: (i) experimentally determine the biophysical properties of
the activator-inhibitor pair, including their diffusion coefficients, degradation (clearance) rates, and relative
activation and inhibition constants; (ii) characterize the genetic and developmental bases of pattern
evolution from dispersed spots to longitudinal stripes between closely related species; and (iii) identify the
key cis-regulatory elements that constitute the activator-inhibitor interacting network and test the function of
this two-component, activator-inhibitor module in other tissue types and heterologous systems. Towards
these ends we will use a suite of approaches, including fluorescence imaging, genetic mapping, transgenic
manipulation, and mathematical modeling. Together our efforts will provide an in-depth view of how the RD
mechanism generates self-organizing spatial patterns and modulates pattern evolution in a real biological
system, lending empirical support to the mathematically elegant but somewhat controversial RD model."

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal death
in the motor system, both in the brain and spinal cord. It results in progressive weakness throughout the body,
with death typically from respiratory failure within 3 years of symptom onset. Therapy initiation and drug
development are hindered, in part, by the lack of quantitative biomarkers for the disease. In the proposed
project a multi-center study will be carried out to validate and further characterize a potential biomarker for
ALS, known as intermuscular coherence (IMC). IMC measures the correlation of activity between two muscles
and represents the shared input to the muscles from motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In vivo studies
in both non-human primates and humans suggest that IMC in the range of 15-40 Hz (β-to-γ frequencies)
represents input to muscle pairs from upper motor neurons. When motor neurons in the brain are damaged, as
happens in ALS, IMC decreases in the βγ frequency range. In a preliminary report we showed that patients
with ALS have lower IMC in the βγ range than do age- and sex-matched control subjects. Because the
measurement of IMC is quick, non-invasive, painless, and requires only equipment found in standard clinical
neurophysiology labs, the method, if validated, would be an important biomarker for ALS.
 Proposed is a multi-center validation study of IMC in the clinical environment. First, the accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity of the biomarker will be determined in patients who present to neurology clinic for an initial
evaluation when ALS is suspected. In order to provide the most specificity, the distribution of IMC values will
be characterized in neurotypical subjects across several demographic subgroups. Finally, IMC will be
monitored over time in patients with ALS to determine how IMC changes with ALS disease progression.
Preliminary data suggest that IMC could be a useful biomarker for diagnosing ALS, allowing differentiation of
ALS from ALS-mimic disorders, and that it can be used to objectively monitor the progression of ALS over
time. A multi-center study to test the validity of these preliminary findings is important before this method can
be implemented to speed diagnosis and provide faster access to treatments of ALS for patients."
10744758,"SUMMARY
SOX2 is a cell fate–determining transcription factor that is expressed in ~70% of cutaneous and head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in patients. SOX2 is highly enriched in stem cell–like tumor-propagating cells
(TPCs), which are located within the basal SCC layer where they can self-renew or differentiate into suprabasal
SCC cells without proliferative potential. Although we know SOX2 controls the fate choice between TPC self-
renewal and squamous differentiation, it is unclear how its activity is regulated in SCCs and whether these
regulatory mechanisms could be developed into therapies for cancer patients. Here, we propose to test the
hypothesis that phosphorylation of SOX2 inhibits its activity, perturbs the SCC-specific SOX2-PITX1-
TP63 self-renewal circuit that drives clonal expansion and SCC growth, and thereby restores the KLF4-
dependent squamous differentiation program in SCCs. Our hypothesis is based on our preliminary studies,
which showed that SOX2 can be phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation attenuates its activity in SCC
cells. We propose to 1) test if SOX2 phosphorylation inhibits TPC self-renewal, clonal expansion, and SCC
growth; 2) identify the kinases and phosphatases that regulate SOX2 phosphorylation and function; and 3) define
the molecular mechanisms by which SOX2 activity governs TPC self-renewal, SCC growth, and differentiation
in mouse and patient-derived SCC models. We expect our proposed research will explain the fate choice
between TPC self-renewal and terminal differentiation on a molecular level and therefore provide new concepts
for the rational development of pharmacological approaches that enforce the commitment of TPCs to terminally
differentiate into SCC cells without proliferative potential."
10741811,"Project Summary. The Chicago Clinical Trials Unit (CCTU) is a consortium of four Clinical Research Sites
(CRSs) which will address two priority clinical research areas of the NIAID: 1) adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic
strategies, including novel therapeutics, HIV cure, noninfectious comorbidities, and infectious comorbidities
of hepatitis B and tuberculosis; and 2) integrated HIV prevention strategies, including novel long-acting ARV-
based HIV prevention agents and delivery systems for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), multi-purpose
prevention technologies, integrated biomedical and socio-behavioral HIV prevention strategies, and
collaborative protocols with the HIV Vaccines Network testing antibody-mediated prevention strategies. The
CCTU consists of four highly experienced and scientifically productive CRSs that are uniquely positioned to
develop, implement and adapt the clinical research priorities of the NIAID clinical research priority areas. The
CCTU has a proven track record and will continue its productivity through active engagement with a diverse
host of at-risk and HIV-impacted communities, participation in high impact, ground-breaking clinical research
studies, efficient management of resources and critical performance oversight of the clinical activities,
laboratories, and pharmacies. Compliance with all relevant rules and regulations is a priority of the
consortium. The CCTU includes CRSs and personnel that have long-term productive involvement with the
two research networks with which the CCTU is affiliated, and platforms for inter-network collaboration with
the other NIAID networks. The CRSs and their network affiliations are: Northwestern University (adult
HIV/AIDS therapeutic strategies); Rush University (adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic strategies); Trinity Health &
Wellness Center (adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic strategies); and The Ruth L. Rothstein CORE Center (HIV
prevention and adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic strategies). The cities of Chicago and Dallas, where the CRSs
are located, are in Cook and Dallas counties, two of the 48 “hot spots” counties where half of new HIV
diagnoses in the US were concentrated in 2016 and 2017. The aims of this proposal are: development,
implementation and adaptation of the clinical research program of the 1) Adult HIV/AIDS Therapeutics
Strategies Clinical Trials Network in four CRSs, and 2) HIV Prevention Network in one CRS, in synergy with
all CCTU elements, and 3) To ensure all CCTU research is relevant to HIV impacted populations and
ethical through dynamic engagement of the community in all phases of the research. The CCTU is
well-positioned to reach diverse populations and contribute significantly to the NIAID research agenda.
RELEVANCE: The phenomenal scientific advances in HIV/AIDS research over the past 35 years have in
large part been due to NIAID's high-impact therapeutic and prevention studies being performed by its clinical
trials units (CTUs). The CCTU will continue to respond rapidly to emerging clinical research needs, engage
constituents, and identify more effective treatment and prevention strategies."

As Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment strategies increasingly focus on prevention at the preclinical stage, a
corresponding effort to improve detection of early changes in cognitive function is urgently needed. Subjective
Cognitive Decline (SCD) provides a unique opportunity to identify emerging cognitive symptoms from the
person's own perspective that can complement neuropsychological assessment at the preclinical stage.
Furthermore, SCD has direct applications for AD prevention trials seeking to demonstrate treatment effects
that impact study participants' daily lives. We propose to recruit a new cohort of SCD individuals who report a
concern for recent, persistent changes in cognitive functioning. Individuals will be recruited from both the
community and the memory disorders clinics (n=100) and will be followed over the course of 3 years.
Specifically, we will capture high frequency SCD report (i.e., quarterly) that can be administered unsupervised
via personal electronic device (e.g., computer, smart phone, tablet). In this way, participants will be able to
complete assessments at-home, rather than coming to the clinic. SCD trajectories will be associated with other
markers of disease severity, including in vivo AD biomarkers longitudinally, amyloid (Pittsburgh Compound B-
PET) and tau (Flortaucipir-PET) and objective cognitive decline. The information gleaned from these
complementary methods will improve our ability to identify high risk participants more likely to decline and to
track clinically meaningful response to treatment."
10747972,"Project Summary/Abstract
Up to 30% of patients surviving aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) develop delayed cerebral
ischemia and neurological deficits 4-10 days post-SAH which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality.
Recent clinical studies indicate that the cause of delayed ischemia and neurological deficits is multifactorial, and
includes microthrombi and inflammation. Intravascular microthrombi after aSAH in humans peak 1-2 week post-
SAH, mirroring delayed neurological deficit onset, and are significantly higher in the brains of aSAH patients who
had delayed deficits vs aSAH patients who did not have delayed deficits. SAH triggers an inflammatory response
which has been linked to delayed neurological decline in aSAH patients. Inflammation-induced neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs, extracellular web-like chromatin scaffolds which mediate inflammation and thrombosis)
has been reported in aSAH patients, but have not been studied in the context of delayed deficits post-SAH.
Our preliminary data in humans and mice suggest that microthrombi and NETs contribute to the development of
delayed ischemia and deficits after SAH. So, our central hypothesis is that microthrombi and NETs are
causative factors (via lower brain perfusion, small infarcts, and inflammation) for the development of delayed
deficits after SAH. This will be the first proposal designed to specifically study delayed neurological deficits using
a mouse model of SAH to investigate the potential contributing factors of delayed deficits.
Specific Aim 1: Interrogate the role of microthrombi in delayed functional deficits after SAH in mice. Our
hypothesis is that microthrombi formation causes a sustained reduction in brain tissue perfusion leading to
delayed infarction and delayed functional deficits. To test our hypothesis, we will use prototypic inhibitors of
platelet activation to attenuate microthrombi in wild-type and platelet-fluorescent mice subjected to SAH. Various
imaging modalities will be used to assess brain perfusion, microthrombi formation, and infarction. Functional
performance will be tested daily for 6 days post-SAH. This aim will identify if platelet-inhibition/microthrombi have
a substantial influence on delayed SAH injury, including delayed infarction and delayed functional deficits.
Specific Aim 2: Investigate the contribution of neutrophil extracellular traps to delayed functional deficits
after SAH in mice. Our hypothesis is that NETs contribute to vessel occlusion leading to delayed infarction and
deficits. To test this, we will use SAH mice depleted of peripheral neutrophils (with a Ly6G antibody), or treated
with Cl-amidine (to prevent NETs) or DNase-I (to lyse NETs). Several imaging modalities will be used to assess
brain perfusion, NET formation, infarction, and infiltrating immune cells. Neurobehavior will be tested for 6 days.
This aim will determine the role of neutrophil extracellular traps in delayed ischemia and deficits post- SAH.
The long-term goals are to determine if microthrombi and/or NETs are key contributors to the development of
delayed deficits, and to identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent delayed ischemia and deficits after SAH."
10747325,"Project Summary/Abstract
One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference
between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are
many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future.
While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a
major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there
is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar
memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting.
Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in
reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences
between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is
general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern
separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our
understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as
far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding
neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the
engagement of each mechanism.
We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with
the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns
of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed
patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral
memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis
of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by
computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data
mining."
10789850,"A Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Neuroscience at an HBCU - This proposal is for a renewal of our R25 grant supporting a summer undergraduate research program in neuroscience. The organizing center of our undergraduate research program is the Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research, an interdisciplinary, inter- institutional, virtual Center now in its 8th year of support from a Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant from NIGMS. At Delaware State University (DSU), 12 externally funded faculty investigators are affiliated with Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research, and another 14 affiliated faculty at the University of Delaware (UD) take part in Center-sponsored meetings, retreats, symposia and professional development workshops. The undergraduate researchers in our Summer Undergraduate Neuroscience Research Program (SUN-R) program is part of the Center for Neuroscience Research, carrying out research projects with affiliated faculty and participating in Center activities and professional development opportunities.  Our project targets students from DSU and other nearby colleges and universities that serve large minority populations. This will allow us to recruit a diverse group of students and maintain them as part of a supportive, research- focused community beyond the length of the 10-week summer program. As an Historically Black University in which almost 80% of undergraduates are members of under-represented groups and about 65% are African-American, DSU is well-positioned to provide a supportive environment for under-represented students. Our partner schools include: Wesley College, a liberal arts college just 3 miles from DSU which has an undergraduate enrollment that is approximately 50% minority; the Delaware Technical and Community College (DTCC), which has an enrollment in which 36% of the students are from underrepresented groups; and Widener University in just over the state line from Delaware in Chester, Pennsylvania with about 25% underrepresented students. Focusing on students attending institutions within our small state and nearby allows us to keep our SUN-R scholars involved in our Neuroscience Center after the end of the summer program.  Students in our program participate in a 10-week summer research experience working with faculty members affiliated with the Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research, they are engaged in weekly professional development sessions and biweekly “Think Like a Scientist” sessions designed to develop students’ scientific literacy and skills at problems solving and reading scientific articles. After the summer program many students participate in Neuroscience Center-sponsored seminars, retreats, symposia and professional development opportunities through the summer and the following academic year.  In the first four years of our program over 66% of our 56 participants were members of groups under- represented in STEM. Of the 54 students who completed our summer program, 30 have graduated with a BS degree, 9 have gone on to MS or PhD programs in STEM, and 23 are still pursuing STEM BS degrees. Our program combining a high quality research experience with participation in a neuroscience-focused community and skill-building activities has helped to build participants’ preparation and enthusiasm for graduating with a STEM BS degree and pursuing a PhD in areas related to biomedical and behavioral research. A five-year renewal will allow us to continue that success."

Our vision for the Skin Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) is to create a first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, 2D and 3D
spatially-resolved multi-omic spatial atlas of normal skin comprising cell types, lipidomics, and
transcriptomics. Samples will be prospectively collected from four major body locations including head and
neck, back, abdomen and extremities across the continuum of skin colors (using the more objective Fitzpatrick
scale). Many of the original studies on skin cell types are now several decades old and conducted using
singleplex IHC or bulk genomic analysis. Although skin atlases exist, they are more focused on disease, and
tend to be lacking in diversity and variation of skin tones. Skin aging is a dynamic process in which there has
been little advancement in understanding how it varies as a function of skin tone and UV exposure. This novel
spatial reference map of skin cell types spanning skin tone and location will provide critical new insights into
healthy skin characteristics. Prospective sample collection provides the unique opportunity to custom build a
database with more extensive clinical information that may affect skin health. Although we will focus on
recruitment of an ethnically diverse population, patients will be standardized to the 6-point Fitzpatrick skin
color scale, which was originally developed to assess risk of UV damage from phototherapy. Using this scale
allows us to take a more objective approach to assessing differences in skin health and effects of UV and aging.
This program will be led by GE Research in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt)-Department
of Dermatology. Pitt-Department of Dermatology has access to a large patient and volunteer population with
diverse backgrounds, with about 20,000 skin specimens processed every year. We will leverage this population
to collect up to 96 well-curated samples from various anatomically-distinct skin locations (head and neck, back,
abdomen and extremities). Samples from donors across younger and elderly age groups and from persons of
diverse skin colors, as recorded by Fitzpatrick scale types I-VI, will be prospectively collected. GE Research will
be responsible for spatial single-cell analysis and integration of lipidomics and spatial transcriptomics into a
multi-modal 2D and 3D atlas of skin."
10906899,"Technology and digital media (TDM), which includes TV viewing, playing computer games, and mobile device
use, is common among preschool aged children. Many young children exceed the recommended ≤1 hour/day
of parent supervised TDM use and this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. This is concerning because excessive
TDM use has been linked less desired developmental and health problems. Some of these outcomes, such as
sleep, weight status and executive functioning may be interrelated and should be examined together in one
research program. However, past studies of TDM use among young children primarily relied on parent report of
children’s typical use of TDM, resulting in both over- and under-reporting of TDM use. The validity of findings
from these past studies are therefore questioned. FLASH-TV is a new technology developed by our team to
passively, objectively measure children’s viewing of large digital screens, such as TVs or video-game consoles.
In this research program we propose to leverage FLASH-TV along with new approaches for measuring children’s
use of mobile devices, to robustly assess children’s use of TDM across multiple platforms (TV, mobile devices,
and videogame consoles). This will allow us to investigate the role TDM use has on 1) health outcomes (sleep
and child weight status) in project 1; 2) development (executive function) and weight status in project 2, while
identifying any protective role parental scaffolding has on child TDM use, and 3) the effect of timing of TDM use
close to bedtime on child sleep, circadian rhythm, and executive function using experimental studies in project
3. Three cores will be developed to provide synergy across projects and allow for a cost effective approach to
achieve the aims of all projects. An Administrative Core will oversee the communication and coordination across
projects. A Digital Assessment Core will oversee the passive and objective assessment of TDM use and sleep
among children across all three projects. The Biostatistics and Database Management Core will develop and
oversee databases, harmonize variables, and provide statistical support for all three projects. A cohort of 4-year
old children (n=200) and their parent will be established for the overall program by project 1 to assess the child’s
TDM use, weight status, sleep, and home environment. The cohort will have data collected over 10 days at two
time-points, 12 months apart. Project 2 will leverage the same cohort and measure the child’s executive function
and parent-child interactions during TDM use using robust approaches in an observation lab across three time
points (baseline, 6 months and 12 months). A unique sample will be recruited to participate in the experimental
studies for project 3. For the first time, these novel approaches to passively and objectively measure children’s
TDM use in their home environment over multiple days allows us to assess the with-in and between child
association of children’s TDM use on child health and developmental outcomes to provide more robust evidence
to inform future TDM guidelines for children."
10738727,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incidence of esophagogastric (EG) cancer is increasing rapidly, notably among young men. In patients clinically
classified as HER2-positive (ERBB2 amplification and/or 2+/3+ protein overexpression), the combination of the
therapeutic anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab and standard cytotoxic therapy prolongs progression-free and overall
survival. However, intrinsic tumor resistance or mechanisms of resistance developed during treatment limit the
clinical benefit in 32% of patients, and other anti-HER2 therapeutic antibodies failed in clinical trials to treat EG
cancer. Complementary biomarkers and methods are therefore needed to treat such patients. Guided by preclinical
data suggesting that caveolin-1 (CAV1) – the main protein of cholesterol-rich invaginations of the plasma membrane
– reduces trastuzumab binding to HER2-positive EG tumors, we initiated retrospective clinical analyses to validate
CAV1 as a complementary biomarker of HER2. Remarkably, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated that
HER2+ EG tumors expressing high CAV1 (IHC 2+/3+) had worse overall survival than those expressing low CAV1
(IHC 0/+1) after trastuzumab therapy. These promising preliminary results prompted us to pharmacologically
deplete CAV1 (which is present in cholesterol membrane domains) with lovastatin, a cholesterol-depleting drug.
Here, we will perform retrospective analyses of patients with HER2-positive EG tumors to assess HER2 expression
and heterogeneity, ERBB2 amplification, CAV1 staining and the presence of genetic alterations (copy number
variations) associated with trastuzumab resistance. We will analyze medical records to determine if concurrent
statin use is associated with enhanced response to trastuzumab. In addition to retrospective analyses, we will
perform randomized imaging and therapeutic preclinical studies using patient-derived EG xenografts (PDXs)
representing HER2+/CAV1High and HER2+/CAV1Low tumor populations. We will determine the molecular imaging
profile (89Zr-Trastuzumab PET) and therapeutic efficacy in PDXs treated with (1) control saline, (2) trastuzumab
alone, (3) lovastatin alone, or (4) the combination of trastuzumab with lovastatin, to identify molecular features that
confer drug sensitivity and resistance to this promising investigational combination. Aim 1 will validate CAV1 as a
complementary biomarker to HER2, Aim 2 will determine the potential dosimetric impact of the statins on clinical
imaging and identify EG tumor populations that benefit from the trastuzumab/lovastatin combination, and Aim 3 will
validate the use of a statin as a new pharmacologic approach to HER2-targeted imaging and systemic radionuclide
therapy (endoradiotherapy) capable of reducing off-target radiation doses. All three aims will generate important
new preclinical data on the use of statins to improve trastuzumab efficacy, which should provide an excellent
foundation for many future investigations, including clinical translation of trastuzumab/statin combination therapy
and potential broader application to other HER2+ cancers. The long-term translational objectives are to establish
the foundation for a clinical trial combining statin with trastuzumab to prevent or delay the emergence of drug
resistance in patients with HER2+ EG cancer."

CTU will leverage its existing network structure, which has been developed with the support of
the United States Army, the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) and others, to extend the current DAIDS-
funded CTU activity. The current CTU configuration supports the AIDS Clinical Trials Group at
two sites and the HIV/AIDS Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN) at two other sites. In this new
proposal, we seek to expand to a total of 8 sites all of which will support both the HVTN and the
HIV/AIDS Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and increase ACTG affiliations from 2 to 4 of these
sites. To provide stronger support to the new network goals of TB treatment and prevention,
MHRP has formed a strategic partnership with the IAVI to form a potent collaboration supporting
both the science and development of novel interventions for both HIV and TB prevention and
treatment. The MHRP CTU will comprise a core management group located at WRAIR in
Maryland, United States and eight international Clinical Research Sites (CRS) located in Africa
and Asia. These sites will implement clinical protocols from phase I safety trials to phase III
efficacy trials and are located in areas with substantial HIV burden and populations suitable to
participate in planned prevention and therapeutic clinical trials. MHRP’s experience and
innovation in HIV vaccine research and demonstrated capability to address emerging priorities
of HIV cure research will contribute scientifically to the DAIDS vaccine and therapeutics
leadership networks. IAVI will contribute both HIV prevention and TB vaccine scientific
leadership. The expanded MHRP CTU will bring DAIDS, and the networks MHRP is proposing
affiliation with, valuable clinical research capacity with Department of Defense and IAVI
supported staff. Specific aims of the proposal include:
 1. Provide scientific leadership, novel products and innovative approaches.
 2. Provide clinical trial execution of the HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Network and the HIV
 Prevention Clinical Trials Network scientific agenda.
 3. Provide clinical trial execution of the HIV/AIDS Adult Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network

10756946,"SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) infection, which leads to COVID-19, is a global pandemic. Chronic lung disease (CLD),
particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has emerged as a risk factor for infection and
severity of COVID-19. Currently, very little is known of the long-term consequences of COVID-19 and how
factors such as CLD, other comorbidities and social determinants of health (SDOH) influence the trajectory of
recovery in survivors. While similar complications for COVID-19 survivors and risk factors for poor health
recovery may be expected as in other causes of pneumonia and critical illness, long term outcomes of COVID-
19 have not been characterized or quantified. Patients who are hospitalized and critically ill are anticipated to
have greater functional deficits, but even those with mild and moderate COVID-19 may have significant
impacts on function given systemic involvement of infection; rehabilitation needs may be more likely to be
under-recognized and unmet in many of these patients. Overall, functional outcomes may be worse than
expected in all COVID-19 patients because of prolonged length of illness and barriers to receiving rehabilitation
services, including restricted face-to-face interactions, limited capacity, and limited access for many. Because
CLD is associated with increased frailty and impaired function, patients with CLD may be particularly
vulnerable not only to infection but also sequalae of COVID-19. Given the current physical distancing
environment, we urgently need a new paradigm for rehabilitation of patients recovering from COVID-19 that
can inform and apply to other causes of pneumonia as well. In this proposal we will determine patient
rehabilitation needs across the spectrum of severity of COVID-19, assessing if needs differ by CLD,
comorbidity burden, SDOH or other patient risk factors. We will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
novel, virtually-delivered, home-based personalized telerehabilitation program for survivors of COVID-19 that
contains a COVID Reactivation and Engagement (CORE) intervention with exercise and dyspnea
management and additional personalized modules based on patient needs. We will recruit patients treated for
COVID-19 as outpatients or discharged directly home for this program. We have a multidisciplinary team with
expertise in rehabilitation medicine, psychology, pulmonary, critical care, nursing, complementary and
integrative health, quantitative and qualitative observational research and clinical trials, and will accomplish
three separate aims: 1) Determine patient factors associated with severity and complications of COVID-19
utilizing VA EHR data; 2) Determine self-reported functional outcomes and trajectory of recovery after COVID-
19 in a prospective study using mixed methods; and 3) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtually-
delivered, home-based rehabilitation intervention for survivors of COVID-19, with components based on an
individual patient’s needs. Results will characterize the recovery from COVID-19 and identify rehabilitation and
care needs across domains of services that can be offered within VA. Our pilot study will inform larger trials to
test the efficacy of this newly-developed program to improve functioning, reduce secondary symptoms, and
improve quality of life among individuals recovering from COVID-19."

and around the world. The HPTN will address this goal by identifying: 1) new biomedical products and tools for
HIV prevention that have unique characteristics, such as longer duration of action, new targets for inhibition of
HIV replication, or as multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs); and (2) integrated strategies that optimize
use of proven efficacious prevention interventions and new tools tailored to specific populations at risk to
achieve maximal public health impact. These interventions will be evaluated in priority populations for HIV
prevention including women in sub-Saharan Africa, young men and women at risk, men who have sex with
men (MSM), transgender women (TGW) who have sex with men, female sex workers (FSW) and persons who
inject drugs (PWID). The specific aims of this research will be 1) To design and conduct studies of long-acting
antiretroviral (ARV) agents and delivery systems for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); 2) To design and
conduct studies to evaluate MPTs that concurrently prevent HIV and pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) or opioid dependence; 3) To design and conduct studies in collaboration with the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network to evaluate broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), alone and in combination, for PrEP; 4) To design
and conduct integrated strategies for HIV prevention. For the first three aims, the HPTN will use a sequential
multi-phase drug development strategy for the evaluation of new candidates for prevention. Phase 1 and 2
studies will be conducted for the evaluation of appropriate dose, safety and tolerability of the agent(s). The
most promising systemic agents will be advanced using the criteria for a favorable target product profile for
new agents including highly effective and durable protection against HIV, minimal adverse effects and drug
interactions, high levels of user acceptability, and a high barrier to viral resistance. Efficacious biomedical
prevention interventions will be incorporated into integrated strategy study designs that also include socio-
behavioral interventions tailored to the HIV prevention imperatives and contextual needs of the specific
populations at risk for HIV infection. Socio-Behavioral research (SBR) will be integral to the success of all
aspects of the proposed HPTN HIV prevention agenda. Supportive SBR will be used to strengthen biomedical
HIV product development (i.e. to inform user preference and ultimately product design for Phase 1-3 clinical
trials), while integrative SBR will play a key role in the process of designing and adapting behavioral and
structural interventions to complement biomedical interventions in integrated strategy studies. The HPTN will
design and conduct the research through collaboration with its scientific leadership, its research teams,
community partners, research participants, pharmaceutical companies and funders."

 There is a critical socioeconomic and medical need for anabolic therapies capable of replacing lost bone
mass in diseases such as osteoporosis. Humans and mice with striking high bone mass (HBM) can aid in the
identification of novel mechanisms to promote osteoanabolism. Notable examples include activating mutations
in the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5 and individuals with sclerosteosis (decreased SOST expression).
 We have found that deletion of Vhl in osteocytes but not osteoblasts (Dmp1-cre;Vhlf/f) produces a robust
skeletal phenotype, characterized by dramatic increases in both cortical and trabecular microarchitecture
compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Vhl targets hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-a) subunits for
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions, and is considered a
master regulator of HIF activity. In contrast to previous work deleting Hif1a in osteoblasts, we do not observe a
reciprocal, low bone mass phenotype in osteocytes lacking Hif1a. Our data suggest that osteocytes may only
require HIF-2a to transduce Vhl signaling, presenting new possibilities to identify and exploit yet-unknown
pathways in osteocytes, that could be harnessed to improve bone health.
 It is not that surprising that osteoblasts and osteocytes might use different signaling machinery to
transduce a particular signal, as a multitude of genes undergo upregulation or downregulation during the
osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. Increasing evidence shows that while HIF-1a and HIF-2a are both
expressed in bone cells, their stability is differentially regulated, and they induce transcription of distinct gene
targets. While much attention has focused on the role of HIF-1a in bone, very little is known about HIF-2a.
 Our long-term goal is to elucidate HIF-a isoform contribution to skeletal development, HIF-a isoform
functional redundancy, integration with Wnt/b-catenin signaling, and if manipulation of Vhl/HIF-a expression
prevents ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss. Our overall hypothesis is that osteocytes require HIF-2a,
rather than HIF-1a, to mediate effects on the skeleton. Within, we will evaluate the fundamental requirement of
OCY HIF-2a in longitudinal bone growth, as well as HIF-a isoform specificity to recapitulate and maintain the
Vhl cKO HBM phenotype (Aim 1), the epistatic relationship of b-catenin in the HBM phenotype of Vhl cKO
mice (Aim 2), and the utility of targeting HIF-a for improving bone properties in an OVX mouse model (Aim 3).
 These studies will define the role of HIF-a-dependent functions of Vhl in osteocytes that drive acquisition of
HBM. Understanding these signaling pathways may allow identification of novel therapeutic targets leading to
bone accrual and reversing the osteoporosis that accompanies aging and menopause. Doing so will alleviate
the costs and associated quality of life issues that result in the inevitable fractures that are so common, without
the associated complications that accompany current therapy."
10754262,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoclasts are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells and formed by the fusion of mononuclear precursor cells
of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Osteoclasts play a crucial role in the maintenance of bone remodeling
and regeneration. A group of genes regulating osteoclast differentiation have been identified, and the
deregulated expression of these genes has been documented to cause various skeletal diseases. Given the
fact that all genes encoding osteoclastogenic factors are expressed in the context of chromatin, a fundamental
mechanism underlying osteoclast differentiation should involve chromatin regulatory pathways. Studies of
transcription regulation mechanisms by chromatin reorganization may thus aid in the understanding and
treatment of bone disorders caused by abnormal gene expression. MMP-9 is a member of MMP family that
has been studied mainly with respect to its role in extracellular matrix remodeling. Unexpectedly, our recent
studies have revealed that MMP-9 moves into the nucleus and mediates histone H3 N-terminal tail (NT)
proteolysis at osteoclastogenic genes in RANKL-induced osteoclast precursor (OCP) cells. Furthermore, we
found that p300/CBP-mediated H3K18 acetylation stimulates MMP-9 enzymatic activity toward H3NT in OCP-
induced cells. More recent work from our laboratory also demonstrated that MMP-9 binds target nucleosomes
in a manner dependent upon G9a-mediated H3K27me1 and that this binding is critical for MMP-9 recruitment
and H3NT proteolysis at osteoclastogenic genes. In light of these findings, we have generated cell-permeable
H3NTK27me1 mimics as a cellular tool to define H3NT residues important for MMP-9 recruitment and function.
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the biological processes that are controlled by
H3NT proteolysis and the molecular basis of its action as an essential mediator of osteoclastogenesis. The
overall objectives are to investigate MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis as an osteoclastogenic signal, and to
determine the molecular mechanisms whereby H3NT proteolysis activates the genes encoding master
regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Our hypothesis is that MMP-9 establishes and maintains the active state of
osteoclastogenic genes by a two-step mechanism wherein it gets to target genes by sensing local H3K27me1
states and cleaving H3NT in a K18ac-dependent manner. In Aim 1, we will employ the CRISPR-Cas9 system
in which we can manipulate H3NT proteolysis at specific loci, and identify the genes that are directly activated
by MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis and necessary for proficient osteoclast differentiation. In Aim 2, we will
use combined functional and structural approaches, and investigate the role of G9a-mediated H3K27me1 in
the recruitment and osteoclastogenic function of MMP-9 at target genes. In Aim 3, we will examine a possible
involvement of MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis in disrupting nucleosome/chromatin structure, and
generate a mechanistic picture for H3NT proteolysis-mediated transactivation in OCP-induced cells. In Aim 4,
we will identify a group of factors that interact with H3NT and participate in pre-osteoclastogenic gene
silencing, and establish MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis as a key process in removing these repressors
and activating transcription during osteoclastogenesis."
10746828,"ABSTRACT
Once thought to be a mere consequence of the state of the cell, metabolism is now known to play a critical role
in dictating cell differentiation. Non-oxidative glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) are the two
sources of intracellular ATP. Factors that increase osteoblast activity and bone mass such as the Hypoxia-
Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1) have been shown to activate non-oxidative glycolysis. In vitro osteogenic
differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors increases both non-oxidative glycolysis and OxPhos. However, the
role of OxPhos in osteoblast biology in vivo is largely unexplored. To fill this gap in knowledge, we generated a
mutant mouse lacking Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) in uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors
and their descendants (PRX;TFAMf/f). TFAM regulates transcription of the mitochondrial genes that encode
thirteen subunits of the electron transport chain and thus controls OxPhos. Analysis of 3-week-old PRX;TFAMf/f
bones revealed the presence of a severe low bone mass phenotype with spontaneous fractures in mutants.
Our data thus indicate that mesenchymal TFAM is necessary for bone mass accrual. In addition, we provided
preliminary evidence that loss of TFAM inhibits the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) into osteoblasts and significantly reduces their intracellular levels of ATP. Impairment of OxPhos is
the most powerful, consistent and best characterized biological consequence of loss of TFAM across
numerous cell types."" "" However, TFAM also regulates duplication of mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondria have
functions that go beyond OxPhos and ATP production. Therefore, to establish if the impairment of OxPhos and
thus the decreased intracellular ATP is the primary cause of the PRX;TFAMf/f bone phenotype, we asked
whether correcting the ATP levels through forced upregulation of non-oxidative glycolysis would prevent the
low bone mass of PRX;TFAMf/f mice. For this purpose, we crossed PRX;TFAMf/f mutants with mice
overexpressing a constitutively stabilized HIF1 in the same cells (PRX;HIF1dPAf/f). HIF1 is known to promote
non-oxidative glycolysis and to impair OxPhos.. Preliminary analysis of PRX;TFAMf/f;HIF1dPAf/f double mutant
mice revealed that increased HIF1 activity corrected the bone phenotype of PRX;TFAMf/f mutants. Building on
these findings, we will now test the hypothesis that TFAM in cells of the osteoblast lineage is crucial for bone
mass accrual and maintenance by promoting OxPhos and thus ensuring the proper levels of intracellular ATP.
We will test our hypothesis in three Aims. Progressive impairment of mitochondrial activity has been
associated with numerous aging-related diseases, but it is uncertain whether this association is due, at least in
part, to a dysfunctional OxPhos. The successful accomplishment of the experiments we propose in this
application will expand and deepen our knowledge of the role of energy metabolism, particularly OxPhos, in
the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass accrual and maintenance.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is amongst the most common monogenetic
human disorders. Nearly 600,000 Americans are affected by this devastating condition.
Unfortunately, treatment options are limited. To address this large unmet need, we will explore a
novel therapeutic opportunity involving targeting the RNA chemical modification pathway. It has now
become clear that, like DNA, RNA also undergoes dynamic chemical changes that impacts its
processing and function. In preliminary analysis we found that mRNAs from cystic kidneys exhibit
higher levels of a specific RNA modification called m6A, which refers to methylation of the 6th
nitrogen in adenosine. Moreover, we noted that reducing m6A levels by deleting Mettl3, a key
enzyme that mediates this modification, ameliorates preclinical PKD. Further mechanistic studies
suggested a novel hypothesis that lowering m6A levels alleviates PKD by reducing translation of
pathogenic mRNAs. Based on these promising observations, we propose to: (a) use complementary
genetic and pharmaceutical approaches to conclusively validate the Mettl3/m6A pathway as new
drug target in ADPKD. (b) Identify the m6A-regulated pathogenic proteome in ADPKD. In summary,
RNA modification is an emerging field with broad implications in physiology and disease, yet its
impact on kidneys is unknown. We are the first to address these fundamental knowledge gaps.
Building on our strengths in RNA and ASO biology, we will also uncover a novel drug target for
ADPKD."
10747843,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the systems and circuits, within and across brain
regions, responsible for decision making. The objective of this proposal is to determine how a single target for
movement is selected among competing alternatives. An experimentally-tractable approach to achieving this
objective is to interrogate neural circuitry in behaving animals engaged in deciding where to move, a particularly
important form of decision making for survival that we refer to here as spatial choice. The midbrain superior
colliculus (SC) integrates input from several systems representing variables critical for goal-directed behavior,
topographically represents contralateral spatial targets for orienting movements, and is a critical node in the
network of brain regions responsible for spatial choice. However, the mechanisms underlying how spatial choices
are made is poorly understood.
 In a series of experiments in awake and behaving mice, we test the overall hypothesis that inhibitory SC
neurons, driven by local pre-motor output, mediate spatial choice by suppressing SC populations representing
competing targets. The premise for this hypothesis is supported by decades of foundational research in behaving
animal models and brain slices, and by our and others’ recent work leveraging the behaving mouse model to
unify these two branches of research. In particular, in the previous funding cycle we found that inhibitory SC
neurons do not merely suppress local pre-motor output, but instead mediate spatial choice via long-range
projections.
 To test our overall hypothesis, In Aim 1, we examine how activating inhibitory SC neurons modulates
activity across both SCs, under baseline conditions in quiescent mice and in behaving mice performing an odor-
cued spatial choice task requiring selection of a left or right reward port. We then record and perturb specific
projection-based subtypes of inhibitory SC neurons during spatial choice. These experiments test the hypothesis
that inhibitory SC neurons shape activity at distal sites in the SC, providing a mechanism for selecting among
competing spatial goals. In Aim 2, we will determine the relationship between the activity of pre-motor SC
neurons and distally-projecting inhibitory SC neurons by recording and perturbing their activity during quiescence
and behavior. These experiments will test the hypothesis that pre-motor SC neurons inhibit activity in populations
representing distal targets by locally activating long-range inhibitory SC neurons.
 If successful, the outcome of this proposal will be the elucidation of the neural circuit basis for spatial
choice, a key basic function of the nervous system. In addition, our research will lay the groundwork for
elucidating how SC circuitry is extrinsically modulated by other brain regions to subserve goal-directed behavior."
10739021,"The University of Rochester (UR) Infectious Diseases Division (IDD) has meaningfully contributed to the NIAID
HIV/AIDS Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) for over 30 years. The enduring mission of the UR Clinical Trials
Unit (CTU) is to support and conduct clinical research on HIV/AIDS that contributes to the discovery of a
preventive vaccine for HIV, as well as to the discovery of a cure for HIV, and of treatments that reduce the
burden of disease due to HIV infection and its complications. It will acheive this mission by providing exceptional
scientific and administrative leadership, and outstanding clinical trials infrastructure, and by engaging with all
relevant stakeholders and communities, to ensure that the research it conducts is responsive to community
needs. Five aims are proposed. The first is to strengthen our well-established Clinical Research Sites (CRSs).
To do this, we will support 2 domestic CRSs that will participate in the following NIAID CRNs: (i) the `AIDS
Clinical Trials Group' (ACTG); and (ii) the `HIV Vaccine Trials Network' (HVTN). We will also develop a plan to
diversify UR CTU leadership, and to enhance integration and coordination of these CRSs. The second aim is
to provide exceptional administrative leadership that accelerates and enhances NIAID clinical research. We
will do this by continuing and enhancing effective financial management procedures and a robust quality
management program, and by continuously assessing well-defined metrics of operational performance and
capacity; these measures will be used to determine improvement opportunities that will be addressed by
targeted actions and follow-up evaluation to assess the efficacy of such interventions. Performance data will
be coupled to resource allocation, and poorly performing CTU components will be terminated, if necessary.
The third aim is to provide exceptional scientific leadership that promotes important contributions to the
advancement of HIV/AIDS science, and mentors the next generation of CTU researchers. The CTU will oversee
and coordinate groundbreaking research activities at the participating CRSs, develop and execute a strong
research agenda for the ACTG and HVTN, mentor and train the next generation of CTU researchers, and draw
upon campus-wide intellectual capital. Aim four will provide outstanding clinical trials infrastructure, including
data and quality management, regulatory support, laboratory, pharmacy and other resources. Innovations will
include procedures that facilitate flexibility and surge capacity, allowing a rapid response to emerging Network
needs, as well as shared resources that promote cost efficiency. Finally, our fifth aim is to communicate and
engage effectively with all UR CTU stakeholders. The Rochester Community Advisory Board (CAB) and our
diverse Community Education and Recruitment (CER) Team will engage with local communities, to increase
community awareness and education, and facilitate recruitment and retention of research participants. Finally,
we will also continue highly responsive communication and engagement with NIAID, its CRNs, and all other
key constituencies."

The Prospective Genetic Risk Evaluation and Assessment (PROGRESS) in Autism Center at Columbia
University will accelerate multidisciplinary research in a diverse population-based newborn cohort focused on
early life identification of genomic risk variants for autism, parent experience with receiving this genetic
information, and the analysis of early neurobehavioral trajectories to predict autism. Newborn screening using
genomic sequencing is a platform that can deliver genetic diagnoses before autism symptoms emerge –
providing the opportunity for early intervention but also raising numerous questions about family impact and
appropriate management of the child. Although early intervention improves autism outcomes, there currently are
no established neurobehavioral markers to predict autism in genetically at-risk infants. With its unifying theme of
Advancing Early Evaluation of Genetic Risk in Autism: Foundations, Implications, and Potential, the
PROGRESS Center will harness expertise in genomics, developmental neuroscience, autism diagnosis,
psychosocial assessment, and data science to address these gaps in autism research. We will leverage a funded
project piloting whole genome sequencing in a diverse population-based group of 100,000 infants in New York
City, allowing us to identify rare, monogenic (e.g., CHD8) conditions associated with high risk for autism to
prospectively enroll and longitudinally follow 240 infants at identified genetic risk (IGR) of autism (out of ~400
eligible) and a matched group of 120 infants without identified genetic risk (non-IGR) of autism (together
comprising the PROGRESS cohort). Because experiences and attitudes likely vary across race, ethnicity, and
socioeconomic status, our diverse, population-based cohort will maximize generalizability of our findings. The
three proposed Center Research Projects are built around this cohort. Project 1 will identify genes and genetic
variants to improve autism risk prediction by using large existing genomic datasets and prospectively evaluate
genomic risk prediction in the PROGRESS cohort. Project 2 will examine the immediate and longer-term impact
of receiving genetic information on psychosocial function and parental self-efficacy in parents of PROGRESS
cohort infants. Project 3 will identify emerging neurobehavioral trajectories and assess the utility of these
trajectories in improving the prediction of later autism diagnosis among IGR infants. These inter-related Projects
will be supported by four Cores that also will be a resource of excellence to local, national, and global autism
researchers for innovative analytic strategies; rigorous diagnostic methods; support for and engagement of
autism communities in research; and capacity building for new autism researchers."

Replication protein A (RPA) is required for nearly every DNA repair and replication process. RPA binds single-
stranded DNA and interacts with dozens of proteins at sites of DNA maintenance. We are interested in the
protein complexes that form between RPA and other proteins when performing specific DNA repair tasks. The
current project examines RPA’s role as a central scaffold in uracil base excision repair. Our approach is to
manipulate the binding of RPA to Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG2) to examine the relevance of their
interaction. We have developed a strategy to covalently tether together RPA and UNG2 to form mini DNA
repair complexes that resemble the architecture of the two proteins when they interact in cells. Our Preliminary
Data demonstrates our success at forming RPA-UNG2 protein complexes in both cellular and recombinant
systems. This allows us to definitively determine how RPA functions as part of a protein complex with UNG2,
and complementary studies examine the effects of weakening their association. Specifically, Aim 1 uses
purified RPA and UNG2 constructs to examine the activity of the proteins alone or as part of a complex.
Binding and enzymatic experiments using synthetic DNA substrates will determine the structural nature of their
substrates in vivo. We focus specifically on the action of RPA and UNG2 at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions, their
known substrates, by preparing uracilated fork-like DNA structures that resemble replication forks found in the
nucleus. Aim 2 examines the RPA-UNG2 protein complex in human colorectal cells under conditions of uracil
stress that are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. The strength of RPA’s interaction with
UNG2 will be controlled and correlated with UNG2’s uracil excision efficiency at the replication fork. Finally,
additional cellular proteins that associate with RPA and UNG2 will be identified. The function of these proteins
will be examined in the context of multi-protein complexes that form during uracil base excision repair. The
targeted scope of this project examining RPA in base excision repair will facilitate our methodological
development, which will be widely adaptable for examining RPA-containing protein complexes in other DNA
repair processes."
10746822,"Neurotransmitter release is acutely triggered by Ca2+ and is regulated during presynaptic plasticity processes
that underlie some forms of information processing in the brain. Characterization of the mechanisms of release
and its regulation is thus critical to understand brain function and will facilitate the development of therapies
for multiple neurological disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) and for diseases involving
defects in regulated secretion, which controls many important physiological functions (e.g. heart rate, blood
pressure and insulin release). This research is also relevant to cell biology in general because of its importance
to understand intracellular membrane fusion. The machinery that controls release contains a core formed by
SNARE proteins, Munc18, Munc13, NSF and SNAP, and specialized proteins that regulate release including
Munc13 itself, synaptotagmin, complexin, RIM, Rab3 and CAPS among others. The research proposed in this
application involves an interdisciplinary approach integrating structural studies of these proteins,
reconstitution assays and electrophysiological analyses of neurotransmitter release in neurons performed by
collaborators. This research will build on the previous success of this approach, which has yielded many of the
three-dimensional structures of the proteins that govern neurotransmitter release, has revealed crucial
mechanistic concepts in the field and has allowed reconstitution of basic steps of Ca2+-evoked synaptic vesicle
fusion with eight central components of the release machinery. However, despite these advances, the
mechanism of release is still unclear and fundamental questions remain unanswered. The ultimate goals of this
proposal are to develop a detailed picture of the mechanism of release that integrates the functions of all these
proteins and to provide novel insights into how release is regulated in diverse presynaptic plasticity processes.
For this purpose, structural studies of complexes formed by these proteins using a combination of biophysical
techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
crystallography, will be performed. A key aspect of these studies, which is essential to make major, definitive
advances in this field, will be to analyze protein complexes between two membranes, as the membranes form
intrinsic part of the fusion apparatus and thus are expected to have a strong influence on how the protein
components are arranged to induce membrane fusion. The structural studies will be complemented with
reconstitution experiments to understand how the different proteins control docking, priming and fusion, as
well as with physiological analyses performed by collaborators that will test the relevance of the structural and
reconstitution studies. This research is expected to establish fundamental principles on neuronal
communication that are vital for brain function."
10747365,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Recent clinical trials, using checkpoint blockade, antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) or CD19-chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR), have shown promising clinical results for patients with metastatic cancer. However, despite the
impressive and durable clinical response in cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody, more than 50% of
cancer patients fail to respond to this checkpoint blockade treatment. Immunotherapy based on vaccines and
TCR in many solid tumors is still lacking due to lack of tumor-specific targets. Therefore, new targets and
strategies are urgently needed for the development of immunotherapeutic approaches for solid tumors including
melanoma. Whole exome sequencing approach in combination with computer-assisted prediction algorithms
has provided an exceptional opportunity to identify new patient-specific antigen targets for cancer
immunotherapy. By taking advantage of next-generation sequencing and tumor-reactive T cells, we recently
identified many neoantigens recognized by tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells. Importantly, we
found that some of CD4+ T clones with a single TCR could recognize multiple neoantigens, but not the
corresponding wild-type antigens. Recent clinical studies show that mutation-specific CD4+ T cells can mediate
tumor growth inhibition in melanoma and epithelial cancers, suggesting that CD4+ T cells play a critical role in
inhibiting tumor growth and orchestrating overall antitumor immunity. However, clinical responses of cancer
patients are correlated with the trafficking, persistence and cytotoxic ability of T cells. We show that CD4+ T cells
can be reprogrammed to increase their cytotoxicity activity against cancer cells. Based on these premises, we
hypothesize that neoantigen-specific T cells, in particular CD4+ T cells, play an important role in recognizing
neoantigens that drive tumor-specific antitumor immunity, leading to tumor regression. These neoantigens can
be identified from melanoma and exploited as therapeutic targets for immunotherapy. We further hypothesize
that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells can be engineered for improving their T cell persistence and cytolytic
activity in combination with anti-PD-1 blockade. Based on these premises, we propose to identify novel
neoantigens with emphasis on MHC class II neoantigens using genome-wide sequencing analysis and a genetic
targeting expression system (Aim 1). We further plan to investigate whether potent therapeutic antitumor
immunity can be generated by immunodominant neoantigen and a novel SAPNANO vaccine technology (Aim
2). Finally, we pursue our studies to determine whether SAPNANO vaccine-induced or T cell transfer immunity
can be further enhanced by immune checkpoint blockade or reprogramming T cells to improve their cytotoxicity,
(Aim 3). In all, the successful completion of our proposed studies will potentially shift the paradigm by the
development of novel immunotherapies for many types of cancer including melanoma."
10786029,"Though initially responsive to hormonal therapy, prostate cancer (PCa) invariably progresses to an incurable
metastatic castration-resistant state (mCRPC). Additionally, the proportion of patients with androgen receptor
(AR)-indifferent mCRPCe has increased significantly in the post-supracastration (e.g. -enzalutamide/-
abiraterone) era in men with late-stage lethal disease. Whether treatment-induced or otherwise, this emphasizes
the urgent need to develop innovative non-AR targeted approaches if we want to do more than provide
incremental increases in patient survival and combat this emerging highly-aggressive lethal phenotype. Tumor-
infiltrating fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive cells (i.e. MSCs, CAFs, and TAMs) are recognized as key
architects of the pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumor progression.
This is in part through their production of energy-rich nutrients and metabolic intermediates that the cancer cells
“parasitize” from the extracellular fluid to fuel tumor growth and progression. These observations suggest that a
FAP-targeted therapy could provide an AR-independent multi-faceted anti-tumor assault by simultaneously
disrupting the parasitic dependence on the tumor stroma and eliminating multiple immunosuppressive cell types
within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To accomplish this goal, we have synthesized an orally-available
small molecule FAP-activated mitochondrial protoxin based on niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic
that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with nanomolar potency in a cell cycle-independent
manner, making it an ideal warhead for FAP+ stromal cells with a low proliferative index.
 This proposal is innovative from conceptual and technical perspectives: 1) multiple tumor-infiltrating FAP+
cells in the TME are selectively and simultaneously targeted to overcome the immune barrier and disrupt the
“parasitic cycle” fueling tumor growth; 2) a first-in-class enzymatically-activated lipophilic mitochondrial protoxin
designed to increase the therapeutic index of an FDA-approved drug while sparing toxicity to surrounding healthy
tissue is synthesized and characterized; 3) FAP expression patterns in a unique series of human prostate tissues,
lymph nodes, and metastases as a function of malignancy and treatment status are assessed to identify clinical
states most likely to benefit from FAP-targeted therapy; and 4) efficacy, toxicity, and specificity are evaluated
using a novel series of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models that recapitulate key clinical
features of human PCa in order to delineate biologically-relevant immune-independent and –dependent
mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor response. Furthermore, this strategy combines agents that have been
individually tested in patients, which significantly bolsters potential for near-term patient benefit. More
immediately, the proposal will provide important insights into the role of FAP+ cells in PCa pathophysiology
particularly with respect to their interaction with the immune system, while providing the necessary preclinical
proof-of-principle data needed to translate this innovative therapeutic platform into the clinic."
10746809,"This project focuses on understanding how dietary fluxes from w-3 fatty acids activate the FFAR4
receptor, expressed in primary cilia, in both preadipocytes to trigger adipogenesis and in pancreatic b cells to enhance insulin secretion. The proposal extends from a recent discovery in the Jackson lab of a dramatic requirement for primary cilia in de novo adipogenesis and for the accumulation of fat mass in mice (Cell 2019). Using a knockout of TULP3, a critical regulator of ciliary GPCR trafficking, the group has established a requirement for ciliary GPCR signaling and screened 36 candidates to discover that the w-3 fatty acid (FA) receptor FFAR4/GPR120 is critical. Using FFAR4 and ciliary markers, the group finds that ciliated FFAR4+ preadipocytes comprise a perivascular stem cell population in all fat pads. Further, DHA-FFAR4 signaling synergizes with insulin signaling to direct adipogenic fate change and that FFAR4 agonists rapidly activate localized cAMP in the cilium. To better define the steps in adipogenesis downstream of FFAR4, two genome-wide CRISPR screens for genes important in adipogenesis were conducted, one using a traditional adipogenesis formulation and the other activated by FFAR4 agonists. These screens recapitulated most known requirements
for adipogenesis and provided a wealth of new genes important for the adipogenic program. Among these there is a strong requirement for new factors controlling translation initiation and cap-independent translation. Finally, looking for the importance of FFAR4 in other metabolic systems, the group discovered that all pancreatic islet cell types are ciliated, but that both b and a cells express FFAR4 in cilia. Detailed pharmacology and genetics show that FFAR4 agonists can drive glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated b cells or islets at levels comparable to known secretagogues like GLP-1. FFAR4 agonists also stimulate glucagon secretion in a cells. Both effects require ciliary trafficking. The first Aim will focus on validating and explaining new adipogenesis factors found in the screen. This will focus on identifying specific adenylate cyclases, phosphodiesterases, cAMP effectors, and translational control genes. Aim 2 will focus on FFAR4 signaling in pancreatic b cells to understand the mechanisms of how FFAR4 and cAMP drive insulin secretion and how another w-3 fatty acid receptor, FFAR1, drives calcium influx to cooperate with FFAR4. Finally, in Aim 3, the focus is to use mouse models systematically knocking out both FFAR4 and FFAR1 to examine the cooperation of these pathways in obesity, insulin secretion and diabetes. This aim will also examine human patient adipose tissue to determine if FFAR4+ ciliary in preadipocytes are lost in aging, diabetic or obese patients, also comparing sex differences. Overall, Aim 3 will test whether FFAR4 or ciliary loss is an important driver of diabetic disease progression, setting up critical tests of FFAR4 and other GPCRs for normalizing adipogenesis and improving insulin secretion in aging, diabetic patients."

Network is to identify safe, acceptable, feasible and effective interventions that will lead to the end of the HIV
epidemic among infants, children, adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women worldwide. To achieve
this goal, the Network will evaluate new and longer-lasting treatments for both HIV and tuberculosis (TB) and
strategies for antiretroviral treatment (ART)-free remission and address the complications, co-morbidities, and
co-infections affecting these populations. The Network’s scientific specific aims are 1) to advance antiretroviral
treatment of pregnant and postpartum women with HIV, aiming to optimize maternal and child health
outcomes, and to accelerate the evaluation (pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, antiviral efficacy), licensure and
optimal use of potent and durable antiretrovirals for pregnant women, infants, children and adolescents with
HIV; 2) to evaluate the potential for ART-free remission through therapeutic interventions aimed at prevention,
clearance and post-treatment control of HIV reservoirs in infants, children, and adolescents with HIV; 3) to
evaluate novel approaches for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment in pregnant and postpartum women and
infants, children and adolescents with and without HIV that will lead to optimal dosing, regimens, licensing and
improved treatment outcomes; and 4) to determine optimal and feasible methods for the prevention and
management of complications and co-infections of HIV infection and its treatment in infants, children,
adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women. The Network will identify and evaluate the most promising
and relevant agents and interventions for our populations of interest, based on favorable safety, acceptability,
durability and efficacy profiles among non-pregnant adults, for evaluation in phase I-IV clinical research
studies, following the sequential drug development model. Strategy studies will also be pursued for targeted
interventions and populations. The Network will employ innovative study designs when appropriate to enhance
efficiency while maintaining scientific rigor. State-of-the-art socio-behavioral and pharmacometric methods will
be integrated into IMPAACT studies to ensure appropriate assessment of factors that may influence outcomes
of interest. When appropriate, the Network will pursue early phase evaluation of agents/interventions in infants,
children, adolescents and pregnant women in parallel with studies being conducted by other researchers with
the same agents/interventions in non-pregnant adults. IMPAACT studies are expected to be conducted at
experienced clinical research sites in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The Network’s research will be developed
and conducted with community input at every level and in collaboration with other clinical trials networks,
research groups, pharmaceutical industry and other partners. Studies with the highest scientific merit and
greatest potential for public health impact will be prioritized for development and implementation."
11122982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Binge-eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are potentially life-threatening eating disorders that
share behavioral and brain similarities, genetic risk factors and higher-than-expected comorbidities with drug
addiction – suggesting a common etiology. However, no mechanistic study has examined this possibility due in
part to the lack of an animal model linking eating disorders and drug addiction. Like drug craving and use in
drug addiction, food craving and eating in BED/BN persist despite adverse consequences (punishment). Our
pilot data from rats indicate that extensive cocaine and alcohol histories, known to trigger addiction-like brain
changes and punishment-resistant “compulsive” drug intake in rats, trigger punishment-resistant food intake or
“compulsive appetite”. These results provide an animal model for studying the neurobiological mechanisms
manifesting as compulsive behavior across eating disorders and drug addiction. Food motivation is thought to
be regulated by both homeostatic (caloric) and non-homeostatic (hedonic/incentive) systems. The homeostatic
system detects energy shortages and elicits food intake. However, like compulsive drug motivation, our data
suggest that compulsive appetite is driven by non-homeostatic “motivational/habitual” dysregulation. Like
cocaine and alcohol histories, obesogenic diet histories also led to compulsive appetite via non-homeostatic
dysregulation. Thus, drug/diet-induced changes in brain sites that control non-homeostatic regulation, such as
reward circuits, likely cause compulsive appetite. We previously found that appetitive behavior is, in part,
controlled by ‘food-reactive’ neurons (as indicated by the activation marker Fos) in the infralimbic cortex (IL) –
a part of reward circuits thought to regulate drug and food motivation independently of energy homeostasis;
these neurons thus appear to function as “accelerators” for non-homeostatic appetite regulation. We have also
found that extensive drug histories increase neural food-reactivities in IL and other brain sites within reward
circuits while inducing gene expression changes linked to aberrant neural plasticity and addiction preferentially
in food-reactive – rather than non-reactive – neurons. Such brain changes would entail more “acceleration” on
food motivation via non-homeostatic dysregulation, thereby likely manifesting as compulsive appetite. Based
on the rigor of previous research and premise above, this project will test the central hypothesis that extensive
cocaine/alcohol/obesogenic diet histories induce compulsive appetite via gene expression changes unique to
food-reactive neurons in the reward circuits. The reward circuits contain neurons selectively reactive to each
specific behaviorally relevant stimuli – likely exerting different behavioral functions. We will thus utilize neural
activity-specific gene expression profiling (Aim 1) and rescuing (Aim 2) to target food-reactive neurons. The
expected results will determine genes expression changes functionally linked to compulsive appetite. Such
knowledge may help identify novel therapeutic targets to counter compulsive behavior across eating disorders
and drug addiction."

 While much has been achieved in the global HIV response, enormous challenges remain. Only 60% of
people living with HIV (PLWH) access treatment and 1.7M new HIV infections were reported in 2018. In sub-
Saharan Africa, elimination of mother to child transmission has stalled, men and youth lag behind in knowledge
of HIV status, four of five new infections among adolescents occur among girls, and young women are twice as
likely as men to have HIV. In the United States, annual new HIV infections have remained stable since 2013,
with Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) and women of color disproportionately affected.
 The ICAP Clinical Trials Unit (ICAP CTU), based at ICAP at Columbia University, will oversee research
at five clinical research sites (CRSs): three in New York City (NYC), one in Eswatini, and one in Western Kenya.
The NYC sites serve priority populations of great relevance to the current HIV epidemic, both living with and at
risk for HIV, including Black and Latino MSM, women of color, young people, and people who inject drugs
(PWID). The Eswatini and Kenya sites, in communities with some of the highest rates of new HIV infections in
the world, have the capacity to engage children, adolescents, women at risk, men and key populations.
 Led by Drs. Wafaa El-Sadr and Jessica Justman, the ICAP CTU will pursue an innovative and
comprehensive approach to HIV prevention and therapeutic research that tailors tools and strategies to the
demographic characteristics, behavioral risks, co-morbidities and life circumstances of persons living with or at
risk of acquiring HIV. Research undertaken by the CTU will be multi-faceted, accommodating the complexities
of individual-level responses to interventions across numerous populations, and focused on advances that will
support population-level reductions in HIV infection and improvements in quality of life and survival of PLWH.
 The specific aims of the ICAP CTU are (1) to advance the scientific agendas of all four NIH HIV networks
by contributing to the development of effective HIV prevention, treatment and care interventions, with the goal of
enhancing the lives of PLWH and stemming HIV transmission; (2) to build a strong CTU administrative structure
that is outstanding in its capabilities and streamlined in its procedures, with efficiency, transparency, clear lines
of authority, continuous quality improvement, full community engagement, and the highest performance
standards; (3) to engage fully with the communities it serves through education, outreach and support of CRS
community advisory boards; (4) to support core CRS technical functions, e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, regulatory,
data management, quality assurance, training and staff development; and (5) to align the constituent CRSs into
a cohesive and synergistic Unit that is truly pluripotent and that effectively advances the research agendas of
the networks through development of new research concepts; participation in network protocols, scientific
committees and working groups; and robust accrual and retention of diverse participants."

10746401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from failure of pancreatic islets to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate for
increased insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying genetic and environmental contributions to islet failure is essential to develop new, targeted
approaches to prevent and treat T2D. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and (gluco)lipotoxic stress responses are
central (patho)physiologic processes that contribute to islet dysfunction and failure. Our overall objective in this
proposal is to elucidate the genetic regulation of islet stress responses and to determine how genetic variants,
including SNPs associated with T2D and other metabolic traits (T2D SNPs), modulate these responses to
contribute to islet dysfunction and T2D pathogenesis. Based on previous studies and preliminary data, we
hypothesize that T2D SNPs alter human islet stress responses by changing islet regulatory element (RE)
use/function and expression of their target genes to contribute to islet dysfunction and T2D. In Aim 1, we will
test this hypothesis by characterizing islet ER and (gluco)lipotoxic stress responses at the level of gene
expression and identifying genetic variants altering human islet stress responses. For this, we will use bulk and
single-cell RNA-Seq as well as computational analyses to discover response expression quantitative trait loci
(reQTL). In Aim 2, we will take a complementary epigenomic approach to elucidate genetic effects on stress
response regulatory element (RE) use in human islets. From the same islets as in Aim 1, we will determine the
genome-wide location of REs at steady state and after exposure to stressors using the assay for transposase
accessible chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq). Using these data, we will computationally identify transcription
factors binding to these REs, identify genetic variants altering stress-responsive RE use by chromatin
accessibility quantitative trait locus (caQTL) analyses, and test allelic effects on stress-responsive RE activity
using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in beta cell lines. Finally, we will experimentally manipulate
these islet stress-responsive genes in human EndoC-ßH3 beta cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (epi)genome editing
to determine their functions in beta cell proliferation, function, and survival (Aim 3). This study will provide
mechanistic insight into how human genetic variation modulates these T2D-relevant stress responses in
human islets. By delineating the genes and pathways that modulate islet (gluco)lipotoxic and ER stress
responses and experimentally validating their effects on islet/beta cell resilience, this study will reveal novel
therapeutic targets and guide strategies for subsequent studies manipulating these responses to prevent or
treat islet failure and T2D."

Activating mutations in tyrosine kinase are common in human myeloid malignancies. Our long-term goal is to
improve outcomes in patients with myeloid malignancies through basic and translational studies. FLT3 is the
most commonly mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of this grant is to build upon
recent advances in medicinal chemistry that are pushing the boundaries of targeted therapeutics, to further
inform kinase and disease biology, and to override evolving mechanisms of on- and off-target resistance to
these agents. The central hypothesis is that basic and translational studies employing state-of-the-art
molecular tools to interrogate clinically-relevant models of resistant disease will inform novel therapeutic
approaches and advance our understanding of human leukemia biology. Our rationale is that pioneering work
on BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia represents a paradigm that can successfully be applied to other
myeloid malignancies. Previously, we provided compelling evidence validating activated FLT3 as a therapeutic
target in human AML. This work rekindled efforts to develop potent and selective FLT3 kinase inhibitors that
minimize vulnerabilities to resistance-conferring secondary kinase domain mutations in FLT3-ITD and led to
the recent approval of gilteritinib. However, gilteritinib causes myelosuppression that limits its utility. Our
preclinical work nominated activating RAS mutations as potential mediators of off-target resistance, and our
recent translational studies of patients treated with gilteritinib have confirmed activated RAS as the dominant
mechanism of acquired resistance to this drug. We propose to develop best-in-class FLT3 tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) that are impervious to on-target resistance mutations and devoid of hematologic toxicity. We
further propose studies to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in NRAS-mutant FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells. Our
specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) That potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors will have a
sufficient therapeutic index to enable them to retain activity against common secondary kinase domain mutants
and will be devoid of hematologic toxicity; (Aim 2) That coexistence of pathologically activated FLT3 and NRAS
will create novel dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically; and (Aim 3) That structural studies and
compound optimization can identify active compounds with drug-like properties. Upon conclusion of these
studies, we will have a more detailed understanding of chemical scaffolds that potently and selectively target
FLT3, novel understanding of AML cells that contain co-existent FLT3-ITD and NRAS mutations, insights into
therapeutic vulnerabilities in this setting, and novel therapeutics. This contribution is significant since it has the
potential to rapidly impact clinical investigation and therapeutic outcomes. The proposed research is innovative
because it proposes application of state-of-the-art methodologies to systematically probe the molecular
underpinnings of AML resistant to targeted therapeutics, and combine them with expertise in chemical
structural biology. This work is potentially highly impactful as AML remains associated with a poor prognosis."
10749030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Na+ and Ca2+ ion homeostasis are essential for heart excitability and contractility. At the cellular level the plasma
membrane protein Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) plays a vital role in regulating the ionic homeostasis of both Na+
and Ca2+. It does so by extruding one Ca2+ out of the cell in exchange for three extracellular Na+ ions. In addition
to being transported, both these ions allosterically regulate the activity of NCX. Intracellular Ca2+ increases NCX
activity while cytoplasmic Na+ inactivates NCX via a process known as Na+-dependent inactivation. Despite the
potential physiological and pathophysiological relevance of this regulation, whether the Na+-dependent
inactivation occurs in vivo is unknown and its impact has yet to be determined. Since this is such an exquisite
controlling system, but heretofore uninvestigated, the investigators hypothesize that small changes in cellular
Na+ concentrations may have significant effects on Ca2+ homeostasis by directly affecting NCX activity and
thereby affect excitability and contractility of the heart. Therefore, the goal of this application is to investigate the
physiological impact of NCX Na+ modulation and determine how it ultimately shapes heart contractility. These
studies have been hampered by the difficulties of studying this process in intact myocytes under controlled
conditions. However, with the development of genomic modification via CRISPR technology, this experimental
paradigm, heretofore out of reach, can now be addressed. Using CRISPR, the investigators have inserted a
single site mutation (K229Q) in the native cardiac NCX gene of mice, which will exclusively abolish Na+-
dependent inactivation. By combining electrophysiology and calcium imaging techniques, the collected novel
preliminary data demonstrating that the inhibition of NCX by cytoplasmic Na+ alters the electrical and mechanical
properties of both single cells and intact hearts.
The work proposed here is organized into two aims. Aim 1 will investigate how the absence of Na+-dependent
inactivation alters excitation-contraction coupling in mouse adult ventricular myocytes by comparing, action
potentials, Ca2+ transients and ionic currents measured from adult ventricular myocytes isolated from either
control (WT) or the genetically altered mice (K229Q). Aim 2 will conduct similar recordings but in intact perfused
hearts. Additionally, the cardiac function of live K229Q mice will be assessed using echocardiography.
These investigations are groundbreaking as they will detail the potential function of NCX allosteric Na+ regulation
in cardiac function. This work may also have pathophysiological applications by defining the regulation of Na+ as
a potential target for controlling NCX activity."
10755663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this application we propose that traumatic axonal injury (TAI) leads to an active axonopathy with the molecular
features of Wallerian degeneration and that targeting some of the relevant signals may protect axons as well as
brain systems. This hypothesis is based on recent findings in our laboratory showing that axonal breakdown
after diffuse TAI depends on the activation of Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif Containing 1 (SARM1) signaling and
that molecular interventions to block SARM1 lead to significant gains in preserving axons and rescuing
functions/behaviors that rely on axonal integrity. The case of TAI is unique in the sense that that many axons
are only partially injured and are potentially salvageable, therefore blocking Wallerian-type self-destruction may
afford long-term neuroprotection and change the prognosis of traumatic brain injury. Our proposal is organized
in three specific aims. In Aim 1 we establish that TAI in an index CNS tract, i.e. the corticospinal system, leads
to progressive axonopathy with the molecular signatures of Wallerian degeneration, i.e. activation of SARM1. In
Aim 2 we ask whether axonal protection by genetic or pharmacological blockade of SARM1 signaling in the
injured corticospinal tract translate into protection at the systems level, i.e. prevention of retrograde atrophy of
corticospinal neurons, preservation of corticospinal connectivity and rescue of CST-dependent motor skills. In
Aim 3 we explore the synergistic role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically
signaling by the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and related leucine zipper kinase (LZK), in corticospinal axonal
degeneration following TAI. The MAPK pathway signals general neuronal responses to injury and there is
evidence that specific members of the pathway cooperate with SARM1-related signals in triggering or affecting
the outcome of Wallerian degeneration. To achieve the previous aims, we use a complement of molecular
genetic tools including knockout mice, dominant negative strategies and genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9,
metabolomic assessments, CLARITY-based high-resolution neuropathology, structural and functional
connectivity markers, behavioral testing, and small molecules as probes for molecular targets and also as
therapeutic agents (the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 that serves as indirect inhibitor of SARM1 and the pan-Aurora
inhibitor tozasertib that blocks DLK/LZK signaling). In summary, here we explore specific molecular mechanisms
related to Wallerian degeneration and, in the course of doing this, we establish molecular targets for potential
pharmacological interventions in traumatic brain injury."
10676915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacterial biofilms are responsible for most human infections, causing tens of thousands of deaths and billions in
medical costs per year. Topical biofilms alone cause significant harm to patients by growing on open wounds,
skin lesions, burn injuries, or diabetic ulcers, and elsewhere. Biofilms are notoriously difficult to eradicate, in
large part because of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), a self-produced extracellular matrix in which
biofilm bacteria reside. The EPS benefits bacteria in many ways, including mediating quorum sensing, providing
nutrients, and blocking transport of antibiotics and host immune response. The ability to actively penetrate the
EPS and deliver anti-bacterial cargo where it is most needed would bypass many of these protections and could
thus have a transformative impact on the remediation of biofilms. First introduced in 2004, artificial self-propelled
particles (SPPs) can propel themselves through complex biological media and deliver cargo to specific locations.
Thus, SPPs hold significant potential for biomedical applications such as biofilm remediation. However, SPPs
must overcome significant challenges in the form of biocompatibility, tracking, and control to be viable for clinical
use. Here, we propose to leverage the burgeoning field of DNA nanotechnology to develop urease-powered
DNA-origami-based self-propelled particles (DNA-SPPs) for biofilm remediation. As a model organism, we focus
on the well-studied pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Aim 1 of this study will quantify the dependence of
DNA-SPPs’ locomotion on local urea concentration and pH and elucidate the extent to which they perform
chemotaxis in urea gradients. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that if DNA-SPPs are decorated with glycosyl
hydrolase enzymes (which are widely used to disrupt the biofilm matrix, specifically in the case of P. aeruginosa),
they will degrade the biofilm matrix as they move through it, weakening the protection the EPS normally provides
to bacteria. The success of Aim 2 will be marked by greater efficacy of a model antibiotic (ceftazidime, which has
demonstrated efficacy at treating P. aeruginosa biofilms) administered topically. In Aim 3, we will load ceftazidime
directly onto DNA-SPPs using a pH-sensitive motif (e.g., I-motif) that undergoes structural changes in response
to pH decrease, thus releasing cargo only in acidic regions. By correlating the delivered payload to the pH
distribution, we will confirm the ability of DNA-SPPs to deliver cargo preferentially in acidic regions, where hard-
to-reach bacteria tend to cluster. Finally, we will assess the combinatorial benefits of the approaches in Aims 2
and 3 by using DNA-SPPs to both increase the biofilm’s permeability and to deliver antibiotics deep inside the
biofilm. The major output of this study will be design criteria for DNA-based enzyme-powered SPPs to disrupt
and deliver cargo in extracellular matrix (ECM) environments, which could have a major impact on the treatment
of biofilms, and will lay the foundation for a customizable platform technology applicable to a wide range of ECM-
mediated diseases."

dimensional molecular atlases of the human kidney. This TMC will leverage the unique resources of the Mass
Spectrometry Research Center and the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry at
Vanderbilt University, the world-class clinical environment of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and the
advanced biocomputational infrastructure available to the TMC through the Data Analysis Core laboratories at
Vanderbilt University and the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands to create a capability to molecularly
characterize human tissues in 3-dimensions at a level of understanding unrivaled by current technologies. The
innovative aspect of the proposed TMC is the integration of imaging mass spectrometry, highly multiplexed
immunofluorescence microscopy, autofluorescence microscopy, stained microscopy, spatial transcriptomics,
spatial proteomics, and single-cell RNA-seq to create comprehensive 2-D and 3-D molecular and cellular atlases
of the human kidney. Through segmentation and cell type analysis determined by classical markers, we will
correlate our molecular and clinical information to the existing knowledge of the kidney to better define the normal
phenotypes across a range of diverse samples. The application of this multimodal pipeline to the kidney will
provide a new paradigm of understanding the normal state of this organ across multiple dimensions, both
molecular (e.g., lipids, metabolites, proteins, and transcripts) and spatial (e.g., whole organs to single cells). As
a HuBMAP participant, the molecular atlases produced by this TMC will be disseminated to the community and
to collaborators to generate new hypotheses regarding the function of this important organ system, enabling new
insight into human health and disease. This multidisciplinary effort requires the creation and integration of three
capabilities to 1) procure and manage human tissue specimens, 2) determine and mitigate non-biological pre-
analytical factors, and 3) acquire, process, and disseminate multimodal 3-dimensional imaging and large-scale
omics data. The goal of the proposed kidney TMC is to create atlases for community users, physicians, and
researchers to navigate across the anatomical and molecular landscape of the kidney, generate novel
hypotheses, and tackle meaningful biomedical research questions."

10748393,"Models of basal ganglia function and dysfunction have long been based on a circuit diagram sketching the flow of electrical activity through the nuclei. These models have guided the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases of the basal ganglia, and continue to be useful for design and refinement of new treatments. The validity of the functional models and their predictive value for design of new treatments is tightly linked to accurate information on the circuitry in each of the nuclei. Our knowledge of the anatomical connectivity among neurons in basal ganglia nuclei is good and improving rapidly, but our understanding of circuit effect on the flow of electrical activity is in its infancy. In this proposal, the functional characteristics of circuits in the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia (the striatum) and that in the main output nucleus (the substantia nigra) are analyzed. The experiments use sinusoidal inputs and combinations of sinusoids over a range of frequencies to characterize the effects of local circuits on neuronal responses. These inputs engage the known resonance properties of the neurons and synapses, and they will reveal other resonances that arise from circuit interactions. In some experiments, the input is intracellularly or optogenetically delivered to some or all cell-types in the circuit, whereas in others the periodic input signal to the circuit is delivered synaptically by continuously controlling firing of upstream neurons. These experiments will reveal the circuit mechanisms that amplify or suppress rhythmic activity in the basal ganglia, including both the beta oscillations that are a principal pathophysiological component of Parkinson's disease, and the therapeutic periodic signal generated during DBS."

10746805,"ABSTRACT
Tumor hypoxia reduces the effectiveness of anti-cancer treatment with radiotherapy, some chemotherapy and
immune checkpoint blockade therapy. For radiotherapy, biophysical measures show that hypoxic cells require
2.8-fold greater dose to achieve the same cell kill as those that are fully oxygenated. For immunotherapy,
hypoxia has been shown to contribute to immune evasion and even accelerate T cell exhaustion. For these
reasons, many groups have tried to deliver more oxygen to tumors as an adjuvant to increase tumor sensitivity.
Unfortunately, this approach has met with disappointing clinical results.
We have looked at tumor oxygenation differently, as a supply and demand mismatch, with the supply being
inadequate to meet the demand of the growing tumor mass. Therefore, if we could reduce oxygen demand
rather than increase supply, we could effectively reduce hypoxia and sensitize tumors. Because mitochondria
are the major sink for oxygen within a cell, we propose that novel mitochondria inhibitors would reduce oxygen
demand to match the limited supply. We have identified papaverine (PPV) as an FDA-approved molecule with
the ability to inhibit mitochondrial function at clinical doses. Published studies from our group showed that in
mouse tumors that papaverine can radiosensitize through inhibition of mitochondrial function, producing
“Metabolic Radiosensitization”. Papaverine was originally isolated from the poppy and used as a smooth muscle
vasorelaxant presumably due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase 10A. This activity makes it an effective drug for
cerebral vasospasm, but causes a systemic drop in blood pressure and potential adverse cardiovascular effects.
We therefore propose in this application to synthesize and evaluate new small molecule derivatives of papverine
that we have designed to remove its activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, but retain its activity as a
mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor. Using these PPV derivatives, and sophisticated mouse models of cancer, we
intend to prove that inhibition of mitochondrial function is an effective strategy for removing hypoxia in solid
tumors without affecting well oxygenated normal tissue. Preliminary data supports the overall theory that
mitochondrial inhibitors increase tumor oxygenation and sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint
blockade therapy."
10745658,"While food allergy has emerged as a major health issue, treatment options are quite limited. There is an
urgent need to identify the specific environmental and endogenous factors that prime and then sustain allergic
responses to foods so that new mechanism-based therapies can be developed. We have found that, IgE-
activated mast cells, best known for causing immediate hypersensitivity reactions including food anaphylaxis,
actually play a separate but critical role as food allergen sensors and adjuvants for Type 2 immune responses
and that the activating effects of food-specific IgE on mast cells can be countered by IgG antibodies of
corresponding specificity. Important questions remain unanswered, however: 1) What specific aspects of
Type 2 immunity (Th2, ILC2, IgE+ B cells) are enhanced by IgE-activated mast cells?, 2) Are these effects
mediated by mast cell cytokines?, 3) Is the protective effect of IgG antibodies in vivo, suppressing Th2 and
enhancing Treg responses, mediated by their negative signals, delivered via FcgR2b, specifically in mast cells
and can responses to food allergens be attenuated by using specific monoclonal IgG antibodies to activate this
suppressive pathway? These questions will be answered in this project under the following aims:
AIM 1: Establish how IgE-activated mast cells promote food allergy:
 1.1 Test the impact of IgE-activated mast cells in vivo on emergence of Th2, Tfh and IgE+ B cells and
 evaluate the contributions of mast cell derived Th2 cytokines
 1.2 Examine mast cell effects on emerging effector RORgt+ vs. pathogenic GATA-3+, IRF-4+, IL-4+ Treg
 1.3 Evaluate reciprocal TGFb-mediated inhibitory effects of Treg on mast cell functions
 1.4 Examine the influence of IgE-activated mast cells on ILC2 induction in vivo: Roles of mast cell- vs. gut
 epithelial cell-derived cytokines
AIM 2: Determine how IgG:FcgR2b signals can reset the immune response in food allergy:
2.1 Evaluate the direct role of IgG inhibitory signals in mast cells in suppression of Type 2 and restoration
 of functional Treg responses in food allergy
2.2 Evaluate the effects of high-affinity human monoclonal peanut specific IgG antibodies (and their IgG
 subclass swap variants) cloned from single B cells transcriptomes on IgE-mediated basophil activation
2.3 Use our humanized mouse model of peanut allergy to test the effects of monoclonal peanut-specific
 IgE on immediate hypersensitivity responses (systemic anaphylaxis).
2.4 Test IgG effects on Th, Tfh and Treg responses in the humanized mice"

Overall Research Plan
The Human Lung Biomolecular Multi-Scale Atlas Program (HuBMAP-Lung)
 The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is entering the production phase, with an emphasis on
progressive, high sensitivity and specificity assays, prioritizing spatial biomolecular analysis. Our Tissue Mapping
Center (TMC) proposal will focus on one organ system, comprised of two lungs and related respiratory tract
(trachea to alveoli) that for simplicity we refer to as the “Lung”. Our TMC will generate, standardize, and validate
extensive data from high content, high-throughput imaging and `omics technology to produce systematic human
lung tissue maps at high resolution. We will take a long view of an Atlas, as a collection of 2D and 3D maps
containing images, tabular data, facts about multiple locations at varying resolution, and indexes of named
objects keyed to coordinates of a locational grid analogous to latitude and longitude, to cartographically present
the whole range of salient features of the human Lung. To accomplish this task, our center brings together
Investigators from five institutions, the University of Rochester (URMC), University of California at San Diego
(UCSD), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), University of Washington (UW), and University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), each with complementary lung-focused academic interests, knowledge, and inter-
consortia network connections and with internationally recognized expertise in lung and state-of-the-art
biomolecular technologies. Our Lung data provided to the HuBMAP Data Portal in Phase I has been focused to
single nucleus RNA-sequencing, chromatin availability and beginning spatial transcriptomics. In addition to
further increasing representation of human diversity in these data types, the next phase of our TMC turns primary
effort toward determining spatial organization of cells and matrices defined by not only gene expression but also
proteins, protein modifications, lipids and select metabolites critical to specific cell function within anatomical and
functional niches. With the recognized value of global investigative efforts within and outside the Consortium,
the Specific Aims of the TMC Overall Component concentrate on Communication and Collaboration within the
TMC, between all HuBMAP components and synergistically among national and international researchers and
Consortia."
10769893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Children with movement disorders are a big burden to society. The burden of disease is very high because
of the life-long consequences to the patient, caretakers, and social institutions. Currently there are no cures or
preventative treatments for cerebral palsy (CP), as the mechanisms of disease remain poorly defined. Human
mutations in key enzymatic pathways constitute genetic causes of childhood movement disorders. With the
advent of transgenic rabbit models, a golden opportunity has arisen to study the pathogenetic mechanisms in
brain leading to movement disorders, as rabbits are more likely to present with movement disorders mimicking
that of humans. Rabbits are perinatal brain developers like humans. Mutations in enzymes of
tetrahydrobiopterin pathway result in movement disorders. Tetrahydrobiopterin is an enzyme co-factor and its
supplementation in congenital deficiency disorders ameliorates the movement disorder. Thus, there may be a
critical role of tetrahydrobiopterin in the development of movement disorders, such as CP. We developed a
knockout rabbit that introducing a specific mutation in one of the tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis enzymes,
sepiapterin reductase. Following fetal hypoxia-ischemia, newborn rabbits present with hypertonia and difficulty
with balance. Fetal rabbits showing low developmental tetrahydrobiopterin in discrete brain regions have a
greater disposition to develop hypertonia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to predict which
fetuses will develop postnatal hypertonia. This advance allows the identification of early critical pathways
causing hypertonia. Our objective is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of perinatal brain injury in human
mutations causing childhood movement disorders, by decreasing tetrahydrobiopterin levels using a hetero- and
homozygous knockout transgenic approach in the rabbit. The main question asked in this proposal is whether
tetrahydrobiopterin in selective brain regions contributes to the development of motor disorders with a severity
determined by an added prenatal insult such as hypoxia-ischemia or inflammation. Using genetic knockout of
sepiapterin reductase, we can further lower the tetrahydrobiopterin levels in brain and investigate whether the
resulting motor deficits are increased or that we need less degree of insult to achieve the same motor deficits.
The first Aim determines whether an added fetal insult, hypoxia-ischemia or inflammation from
lipopolysaccharide, enhances movement disorders in the sepiapterin het/homozygous reductase knockout
rabbit. The second Aim will determine if neuronal or oligodendroglial injury explains the development of
movement disorders in the knockout rabbit. We use innovative pre- and postnatal MRI biomarkers of
hypertonia with tissue flow cytometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical
detection. By conducting a time-dependent, organ-specific and cell-specific pathogenetic study, we will obtain
a comprehensive picture of the role of this cofactor in perinatal pathogenesis of movement disorders."
10832657,"Project Summary - Overall
There is substantive variation in preschooler’s understanding of core number concepts (e.g., cardinality)
and associated skills (e.g., counting; Geary & VanMarle 2016) that in turn is predictive of later individual
differences readiness to learn formal math at school entry (Geary et al. 2018) and risk of math learning
disabilities (LD; Chu et al. 2019). Child-centered interventions reduce these gaps (Dumas et al. 2019) but
suffer from fade out and thus do not typically confer long-term benefits (Bailey, 2019). Similar fade out is
found with individual therapy with young offenders, but sustained gains can be achieved with
multisystemic interventions involving the child, home, and school (Henggeler et al. 2009), and it is time
to consider this approach for LD and train the next generation of LD researchers to take a multisystemic
perspective. The Research Core will provide a unique and much-need foundation for the development of
multisystemic – including child, parents, home environment, and classroom – interventions for
preschoolers who are at risk for long-term math difficulties, including math LD. The home component
will provide the most thorough assessment ever conducted of the numeracy-related home environment,
including assessment of parent’s math achievement and the complexity of the math-talk with their
children, as related to preschoolers’ core number development (Zippert & Rittle-Johnson 2020). The
classroom component will include teacher-report and direct observation of students’ engagement in
learning opportunities and the complexity of the math presented in classrooms. The child-centered
assessments will focus on the longitudinal development of the core number knowledge and skills that
predict later school readiness for math learning and risk of math LD (Chu et al. 2019; Geary et al. 2018).
This ambitious combination will enable the first-ever dynamic assessment of the multiple contextual and
child-centered factors that contribute to children’s early math development, including factors that indicate
risk of later math LD. The Leadership Core is seamlessly integrated with the Research Core to provide
training and experiences in conducting child-, home-, and classroom-centered assessments, all organized
around identifying the factors that influence the development of the core conceptual knowledge and skills
that are the foundation for readiness for math learning at school entry and risk of later math LD (Chu et
al., 2019; Geary et al., 2018). The PI and Co-Is have expertise in cognitive science, parent-child
dynamics, public policy, and intervention research that in turn will provide a broad and unique mentoring
experience for graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow. Mentees will also obtain valuable
experiences with in-home assessments, classroom observations, and cognitive and achievement
assessments and insights into how public policy decisions are influenced by basic research."
10760307,"The vascular supply is critically important to the skeleton, yet the clinical implications of vascular dysfunction for
skeletal fragility are poorly understood. Studies demonstrate associations between vascular disease and
osteoporosis in older adults. However, it is unknown whether vascular dysfunction itself underlies these
associations. We propose to use subclinical vascular tonometry and hemodynamic measures to test the
hypothesis that vascular impairments negatively affect cortical bone microarchitecture increasing fracture risk in
the cortical-rich peripheral skeleton. Our preliminary data demonstrate that vascular changes are associated with
increased fragility fractures and deficits in cortical bone microstructure, as assessed by high-resolution peripheral
quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). These data provide strong rationale for our proposed work,
particularly since no previous studies have comprehensively investigated mechanistic measures of blood flow in
both large arteries and microcirculation in relation to skeletal fragility. Our long-term goal is to improve
understanding of skeletal fragility in older adults to reduce the burden of fractures, by focusing on how aging
related changes in the vasculature affect the peripheral skeleton. Our central hypothesis is that individuals with
more severe aortic stiffness and blunted peripheral hyperemic flow response will have more severe deterioration
in cortical bone microarchitecture, loss of bone strength, and higher incidence of fracture. Advanced imaging
techniques, such as HR-pQCT, provide volumetric skeletal compartment specific measures of volumetric bone
density and microarchitecture, while non-invasive vascular tonometry and hemodynamics lend key insight into
the origins of large artery and microvascular deficits. Together, these innovations provide necessary tools to
advance knowledge of the vascular mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility, and will identify novel targets for
fracture prevention. Thus, in the unique setting of the Framingham Heart Study, we will address the following
specific aims: (1) Determine the contribution of vascular function to incidence of fracture, and (2) Determine the
contribution of vascular function to longitudinal changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength. Using
state-of-the-art assessments of vascular dysfunction and cortical bone deficits, the investigative team has the
experience and complementary areas of expertise to successfully carry out the specific aims. By identifying the
vascular mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility, this project has the potential to be paradigm shifting, providing
new targets for interventions to reduce the tremendous public health burden of fractures in our older population."
10739319,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children1, and is caused by both genetic and environmental
factors. Nevertheless, the modifiable risk factors for this disorder remain unknown, creating a pressing public
health need. As ASD likely arises early in prenatal development considerable efforts in identifying such
modifiable risk factors have focused on maternal exposures in pregnancy. Some of those studies have shown
higher rates of ASD among children of women with e.g. diabetes, depression or recurrent infections. However,
(1) women experience many other conditions in pregnancy, most of which have not been studied in the context
of offspring ASD risk; and (2) the mechanisms underlying the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD
remain unknown. While placental permeability to multiple factors in maternal circulation renders direct effects of
maternal health on fetus plausible, this explanation has not been rigorously evaluated against the possibility that
both maternal diagnosis and child’s ASD are caused by overlapping genetic factors, transmitted from mother to
the child. In response, the key objectives of our proposal are to (1) test the associations between maternal health
and ASD systematically, across the full spectrum of maternal diagnoses, and accounting for their correlation,
and (2) elucidate the genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms underlying those associations. To achieve this,
we propose independent, but synergistic, aims to increase the reliability and generalizability of our results.
Aim 1: Systematically identify maternal diagnoses in pregnancy associated with ASD in offspring. Aim 2:
Determine if the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD is due to transmitted genetic factors, using
information on family relations available in Denmark. Aim 3: Test the association between maternal diagnoses
in pregnancy and child’s genetic liability for ASD using molecular genetic data. We will use large, well-powered
sample of >723k live births from Denmark with full demographic, medical and pedigree information, as well as
genetic data for a subset of those individuals (N~26k). All significant associations will be replicated in an
American dataset (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) with ~320k births, ensuring external validity of our
results. The innovation of this project is three-fold: (1) it has a potential to identify novel risk factors (shown in
our preliminary data), (2) it introduces a methodological shift in ASD epidemiology, with large-scale, exposure-
wide and rigorous inference process, akin to that already applied in the field of genetics; and (3) for the first time,
it integrates national data from Nordic registries with one of the largest US-based cohorts (Kaiser Permanente).
This project will deliver a systematic list of high-confidence, maternal diagnoses around pregnancy associated
with ASD risk in two, independent cohorts, and triangulated evidence regarding genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms linking those diagnoses in pregnancy with risk of ASD in offspring. Collectively, these outputs will
contribute new insights into ASD etiology, suggest potential preventive factors and aid the efforts towards early
identification of high-risk families."

Candidate: Victoria M. Martin, MD, MPH aims to become an independent NIH-funded physician scientist and
recognized expert in systems immunology in mucosal food allergic diseases. To achieve this goal, she has
built a large prospective observational cohort designed to answer the questions posed under this award, while
obtaining a Master of Public Health degree in Clinical Effectiveness with training in epidemiology and
biostatistics. She is a pediatric gastroenterologist and Co-Director of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Section of
the Food Allergy Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard
Medical School. She has a strong research foundation but requires substantial advanced training in three key
areas: (1) Integrated Longitudinal Microbiome Analyses, (2) System Immunology with Advanced
Computational Modeling, and (3) Clinical Research Methods and Leadership Development. Her training
objectives and research posed under this award are aimed to prepare her for her first R01 application and will
allow her to develop her own distinct niche in integrated systems biology of gastrointestinal food allergy.
Research: Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease with increasing prevalence in children for which
the biological explanation remains unclear, but the role of the microbiome and mucosal immune system are
being investigated. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is often the earliest and most common
manifestation of food allergy and yet little is known about its pathophysiology or its relationship to other food
allergic diseases, making it an important model for prospective study. This proposal outlines a five-year
research plan using a large observational cohort carefully designed by Dr. Martin to investigate the hypotheses
that (1) a dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome of infants with FPIAP precedes disease onset, is influenced by
diet, and drives pathways of intestinal inflammation; and (2) FPIAP is a first step on the atopic march and the
underlying FPIAP pathophysiology and dietary avoidance together increase risk for IgE-FA. This proposal aims
to elucidate underlying mechanisms for the earliest manifestations of food allergies, validate novel biomarkers
of food allergy development, and identify important novel targets for primary food allergy prevention.
Environment: Dr. Martin will conduct this research at Massachusetts General Hospital, under the duel
mentorship of Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a thought leader in the field of pediatric food allergy and immune tolerance
research, and Dr. Alessio Fasano, a world-renowned expert in the microbiome and gastrointestinal physiology.
She has assembled a training advisory committee of experts in mucosal immunology (W. Allan Walker, MD),
food allergy epidemiology (Corinne Keet, MD, MS, PhD), systems immunology (Jessica Lasky-Su, ScD), and
computational microbiome analysis (Vanni Bucci, PhD; Moran Yassour, PhD). The combination of this
exceptional mentorship and advisory team and expansive resources at Harvard University will ensure her
success in transitioning to independence in an area distinct from each of her mentors."
10744192,"The dramatic rise in U.S. fructose consumption mirrors the increase in the incidence of hypertension. More than
17 million Americans consume >20% of their calories as fructose and crossover studies directly show that
fructose increases blood pressure (BP). We reported that fructose causes salt-sensitive hypertension while
glucose does not. We also showed that dietary fructose enhances the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II (Ang
II) on proximal nephron Na reabsorption, the only nephron segment able to reabsorb and metabolize fructose.
We show here that dietary fructose enhances the ability of Ang II to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) activity and
O2- production by proximal tubules. However, the roles of PKC activation and oxidative stress in the proximal
nephron in fructose-induced hypertension are poorly understood. In addition to reabsorbing ≈70% of the filtered
Na and water, one of the primary functions of the proximal nephron is to secrete proteases that degrade filtered
proteins so they can be reabsorbed. Protease-induced activation of the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) in the
collecting duct causes Na retention and hypertension in several pathological conditions. Heretofore proximal
tubules have not been thought of as a potential source for urinary proteases. Oxidative stress stimulates protease
release from non-renal cells. Here we show that dietary fructose enhances proximal nephron expression of two
such proteases, trypsin and meprin β, and augments the urinary excretion of these and urokinase. We also show
that inhibition of ENaC reverses fructose-induced hypertension. Phospholipase D and increases in intracellular
Ca (Cai) are involved in the secretion of many proteins, and both are stimulated by Ang II. Thus, we hypothesize
that dietary fructose causes salt-sensitive hypertension by enhancing Ang II-induced increases in PKC activity
and oxidative stress in the proximal nephron. This increased oxidative stress stimulates trypsin, urokinase and
meprin β expression and release from this segment. These proteases cleave and activate ENaC in collecting
ducts, stimulating Na reabsorption. Aim I will test whether dietary fructose enhances the ability of Ang II to
stimulate PKC activity and O2- production by proximal tubules thereby contributing to salt retention and elevations
in BP. Aim II will test whether dietary fructose enhances the expression and release of trypsin, urokinase and
meprin β by proximal tubules via O2-, phospholipase D and Cai-dependent mechanisms. Aim III will test whether
fructose-induced trypsin, urokinase and meprin β release from proximal tubules augments Na reabsorption by
collecting ducts, thereby contributing to salt retention and elevations in BP. We will use state of the art techniques
in imaging, physiology, molecular biology and gene transfer. This project will yield new insights into how dietary
fructose causes salt-sensitive hypertension, and which drugs currently used to treat hypertension such as Ang
II receptor blockers and diuretics targeting collecting ducts will likely be most efficacious. Since these drugs are
currently approved for such use, the recommendations could be adopted immediately."
10738766,"Due to an aging population and increased lifespan, dementia is an increasing clinical and public health issue. The most common and well-known cause is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but other important disorders are involved in the development of AD-related dementias (ADRD). What is less appreciated is that Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, while often associated with motor dysfunction, contributes to ADRD with an incidence of dementia as high as 80% in late stages in which most have AD co-pathology. Therefore, this population exhibits a range of cognitive deficits that enables insight into mechanisms involved in ADRD. There seem to be two distinct cognitive profiles in these patients. One is a benign frontal profile characterized by executive and attention deficits, whereas the other is a posterior profile characterized by memory and visuospatial deficits that is associated with faster progression to dementia, often with AD co-pathology. The premise of this application is that identifying the neural circuitry underlying frontal and posterior function may provide insight into structural alterations occurring in ADRD. Dopaminergic therapies are known to improve frontal circuitry function, but not posterior circuitry, leading to the hypothesis that posterior circuit alterations are due to non-dopaminergic pathology, such as AD co-pathology. If true, the pattern of frontal-vs-posterior involvement may lead to differential responses to current treatments in ADRD. I plan to apply diffusion tensor tractography, a sensitive and widely available MRI technique, to measure microstructural integrity of white matter (WM) connections between brain regions. My central hypothesis is that WM alterations in frontal and posterior circuitry occurs in PD (Aim 1); that these alterations are associated with specific cognitive deficits and relate to differing rates of progression to dementia (Aim 2); and the ratio of frontal to posterior damage (F/P ratio) modulates the cognitive response to treatment (e.g., levodopa, deep brain stimulation, Aim 3). These aims will be implemented by leveraging existing datasets allowing a cost-effective and impactful investigation. This study immediately will impact knowledge of WM circuits related to dementia with insight into underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies, as well as provide the foundational line of research for future study of microstructural signatures of AD/ADRD. I have assembled a world-class mentoring team with expertise in areas related to my research and a history of highly-successful mentoring. The environment and institutional resources available to me for this project are excellent with a well-developed training plan and access to required equipment and research datasets. The proposed project and training plan will position me at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering, and enable me to tackle important clinical problems with the latest technological advancements. My new skills in neuroimaging analysis and neuropsychological testing to probe neurocognitive circuitry will provide a foundation for my career as an independent physician-engineer focused on alleviating the burden of AD/ADRD."

This P01 program grant will establish a fully integrated interdisciplinary program of research Projects and
Scientific Cores that are essential to develop a fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between
adolescent health and development, and technology and digital media (TDM). Previous evidence has illustrated
TDM’s connections to adolescent risk behaviors such as increased alcohol behavior and social media exposure,
as well as relationships to adolescent well-being such as improved socioemotional health and peer social media
connections. The goal of the Projects described in this proposal is to address the urgent need to understand how
TDM exposure and usage affect multiple developmental domains and health outcomes. The three PIs are all
located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ensuring close collaboration and synergy, in addition to
outstanding institutional support and resources, including matching funds. The Projects include: Project 1: Using
TDM to understand mechanisms in adolescent health and risk behavior. Project 2: Using functional magnetic
resonance imaging to understand how positive and negative TDM experiences relate to mental and behavioral
health. Project 3: Using mixed methods to evaluate self- and other-generated TDM content as predictors of
socioemotional well-being in sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM adolescents. Each Project utilizes
a 2-year longitudinal design and draws from a shared participant pool. Data collection approaches across
Projects include observed/measured data including observed social media content and fMRI data, self-reported
participant experiences and perceptions via surveys and interviews, and Ecological Momentary Assessment to
capture real-time TDM exposures. To support this program, the Administrative Core (Admin Core) will provide
organizational and management support to arrange regular meetings across Program collaborators, involve
students in the research, leverage biostatistical support and promote dissemination. This P01 proposal will
include a Recruitment and Retention Core (R&R Core), supporting a shared participant pool across Projects,
and ensuring retention over time. This P01 program will promote synergy in these research efforts through
integrated data collection processes over a synergistic longitudinal design, aligned measures and a shared
participant pool so that analyses can be structured within and across Projects. This P01 proposal includes a
priority on dissemination of findings, both to scientific audiences and to the communities across Wisconsin to
reach those who participated in this research. Thus, this P01 program will enhance the scientific knowledge,
ideas and outcomes obtained through the interactions of the 3 Projects, the Admin Core and the R&R Core. This
proposed program will provide both the infrastructure support and the scientific approach necessary to advance
data-informed theories and conceptual models addressing how TDM exposure and usage impact developmental
trajectories and health outcomes of adolescents. Because of the broad potential for advancing research and
possible clinical translation of results, these connected Projects portend an opportunity to improve prevention
and intervention approaches for adolescent health and TDM."

control over noise. This project will characterize HPD-related performance decrements, their impact on choice
to wear HPDs, and how auditory training can be used as a means to alleviate decrements.
 Our innovative approach will use a paradigm where speech informs subjects to perform specific
aspects of a sensorimotor task. This mimics critical communication scenarios in first responders (e.g., a
firefighter given speech commands that inform her/his performance on another task). HPD listening will be
simulated with a digital filter designed to mimic the attenuation profile of an actual HPD.
Electroencephalographic (EEG) data will allow covert examination of neural signatures of ongoing cognitive
processes. The approach will allow the characterization of HPD-related performance effects to a level of detail
not achieved before, while at the same time maintaining research-to-practice relevance in the mapping of our
experimental task to first responder operational situations.
 AIM 1 will characterize HPD-related decrements in performance. We expect that comparison of HPD
and no HPD conditions will reveal the extent to which HPD use impacts multiple dimensions of performance
(e.g., speech comprehension, sensorimotor task accuracy, and mental effort). AIM 2 will determine whether or
not performance decrements impact choice to wear HPDs. Here, we will allow subjects to voluntarily toggle
their simulated HPD on and off, while at the same time manipulating performance incentives to examine how
listening difficulty impacts time spent ""wearing"" hearing protection. AIM 3 will test an auditory training
approach to alleviating performance decrements. Here, we will compare effects of auditory training in HPD
and no HPD conditions on multiple dimensions of performance. Aim 1 Impact will be in knowledge gains that
cannot come from standard survey and focus group methods. The Impact of Aim 2 will be to provide an
assessment of how performance decrements impact actual choice to wear. The Impact of Aim 3 will be to
provide a means to address performance decrements in HL prevention programs (HLPPs).
 Relevant NIOSH strategic goals include goals to: ""reduce occupational hearing loss"", and inform
""hearing loss prevention education for employers and workers"". NORA sector groups of public safety,
construction, and manufacturing have clear relevance. Outputs include publications and conference
presentations at interdisciplinary venues that will accelerate research-to-practice directions. Outcomes entail
new approaches to addressing HPD use rates, and eventually, reduced occupational HL."

The Wits HIV Research Group Clinical Trials Unit (WHRG CTU) under the joint PI Leadership of Ian Sanne
and Helen Rees, includes four experienced pleuripotent Clinical Research Sites (CRSs), namely the Wits
Helen Joseph Hospital CRS (Dr Sharlaa Badal-Faesen), The Wits RHI Shandukani Maternal and Child CRS
(Dr Lee Fairlie), Wits RHI Hillbrow Health Precinct Ward 21 CRS (Prof. Sinead Delaney-Moretlwe) and the
Wits RHI Research Centre (Dr Thesla Palanee-Phillips). These four CRSs have capacity to conduct clinical
trials across all four NIH Networks, the ACTG, IMPAACT, HPTN and VTN.
 The CTU’s research agenda includes HIV treatment, HIV-associated infections and HIV-related cancers; HIV
prevention; TB treatment and prevention (including MDR-TB) and Hepatitis. The CTU conducts research
across all key populations, including adolescent girls and young women, men who have sex with men,
transgender populations and female sex workers; as well as vulnerable populations such as neonates, infants,
older children, pregnant and breastfeeding women. The CTU has capacity to conduct Investigational New Drug

Chronic pain – often arising from musculoskeletal injury, neurological dysfunction, cancer, or autoimmune disorders –
affects ~100 million Americans. Overreliance on opioid analgesics has resulted in a national public health crisis in which
opioid overdoses have claimed over 47,000 lives in 2017 and are now the leading cause of avoidable deaths in the nation.
The Cannabis plant has analgesic and anti‐inflammatory properties owing to its rich content of cannabinoids, terpenes,
lignans, and flavonoids. However, research on the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of the numerous bioactive
phytochemicals – alone or in combination (entourage effect) – has been limited. We have assembled a complementary
and interdisciplinary team that combines expertises in molecular and cellular signaling, ion channel biology, natural
products chemistry, and molecular pharmacology as well as all aspects of endocannabinoid biology. Our preliminary high‐
throughput screening (HTS) bioassays have identified several cannabinoids that inhibit calcium signaling in immune
cells and may therefore reduce inflammation and the associated pain. Results from the work proposed here will identify
the anti‐inflammatory molecules contained in Cannabis sativa and characterize the mechanisms of action they engage.
We hypothesize that specific phytochemicals in Cannabis suppress cellular Ca2+ signaling and subsequent release of pro‐
inflammatory cytokines in immunocytes that contribute to inflammatory pain. We further hypothesize that combinations
of Cannabis phytochemicals synergistically inhibit certain ion channels and G protein‐coupled receptors involved in
immunocyte Ca2+ signaling and cytokine release, thereby ameliorating inflammatory pain.
We propose to perform pharmacological profiling of individual and entourage effects of Cannabis phytochemicals on
Ca2+ signaling in 5 specific pro‐inflammatory human immune cells (Aim 1A). We will determine the cellular and molecular
Ca2+ mobilizing mechanisms engaged by active Cannabis phytochemicals in these immune cells (Aim 1B); and profile
Cannabis phytochemicals on established molecular targets of nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pain (specific
TRP channels and G‐proteins) using heterologous expression systems, HTS bioassays and single cell electrophysiology (Aim
1C). In Aim 2 will assess analgesic properties of active cannabinoids and combinations using in vivo mouse models of
inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Here, we will first determine in vitro “Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and
Excretion” (ADME) properties (Aim 2A) and in vivo pharmacokinetics (Aim 2B) of said cannabinoids. We will then assess
the most favorable cannabinoid(s) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)‐induced inflammation and paclitaxel‐mediated
toxic neuropathic pain (Aim 2C).
Together, these studies will create a comprehensive and mechanistic knowledge base about the efficacy, potency and
suitability of Cannabis‐derived phytochemicals as anti‐inflammatory analgesics and may contribute to ameliorating the
current opioid epidemic."

Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe form of epilepsy with a high rate of SUPEP. Respiratory
failure is a leading cause of SUDEP, and DS patients' frequently exhibit disordered breathing.
However, mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown. Evidence
suggests cortical seizures activate inhibitory projections to suppress brainstem function and
result in death; however, a yet unexplored possibility is that DS-associated mutations directly
affect brainstem respiratory centers and serve as a common substrate for both seizure and
respiratory dysfunction. We recently showed that Scn1a transcript is highly expressed in
brainstem inhibitory neurons, and expression of a DS-associated Scn1a mutation (A1783V) in
inhibitory neurons resulted in cell autonomous loss of neural activity and disruption of
respiratory function at the cellular and whole-animal levels. Therefore, I hypothesize that loss of
Scn1a function directly impacts brainstem respiratory control. To test this, I will disrupt Scn1a
function globally (Scn1a-/+), specifically in all VGAT+ inhibitory neurons and only in glycinergic
neurons (GlyT2:A1783V) and determine whether these animals exhibit disordered breathing,
seizures or premature death (Aim 1), and altered cellular activity of respiratory neurons (Aim 2).
This work will provide novel insight into roles of glycinergic neurons in DS, and determine the
extent to which loss of Scn1a function directly affect brainstem function."

The overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is a primary mechanism by which tumors protect themselves
from chemotherapeutic interventions. Most effort in the field has focused on a specific molecular domain that is
common to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which binds and prevents pro- apoptotic family members
from initiating programmed cell death by the mitochondrial pathway. Our preliminary data, however, indicate that
Mcl-1 protects tumors from therapeutic interventions by a second mechanism, independent of its anti-apoptotic
activities. Specifically, our data indicate that Mcl-1 contains a unique loop domain that binds proteins that regulate
gene expression when the molecule is translocated from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in response to
chemotherapy. Specifically, the data demonstrate that once localized to the nucleus, Mcl-1 interacts with
machinery known to regulate RNA stability, and directly suppresses the expression of transcripts normally
upregulated in chemosensitive cells, including genes involved in the production of reactive oxygens species such
as NOX4. We use colorectal cancer as our model, solid tumor because: 1) it continues to be one of the deadliest
human cancers; 2) mounting data indicates that Mcl-1 plays a major role in regulating chemoresistance in colon
cancer; and 3) we have access to a very large colorectal cancer tumor bank, from which we have generated
numerous patient-derived models. It is our hypothesis that Mcl-1’s role in chemoresistance depends on its ability
to leave the mitochondria and translocate to the nucleus, and to post-transcriptionally coordinate a stress
response to cope with chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress. We thus hypothesize that to optimize targeting
of Mcl-1, a combinatorial approach is necessary, whereby inhibitors of both its anti-apoptotic mechanism and
the loop domains mediating its nuclear activities will provide the comprehensive strategy needed to overcome
the tumor’s chemoresistance. We propose the following three related but independent aims to test our hypothesis:
1) Determine the mechanism by which chemotherapy induces Mcl-1 nuclear translocation. 2) Investigate the
mechanism by which nuclear Mcl-1 mediates chemoresistance. 3) Develop strategies that target Mcl-1’s multiple
mechanisms of chemoresistance. Successful completion of these aims will yield new targets for rendering tumors
chemosensitive and will provide the understanding needed for anti-Mcl-1 drug design for colorectal- and
ultimately other forms of cancer. As there is significant pharmaceutical interest in designing inhibitors of Mcl-1
for solid tumor therapy, our proposal is extremely timely for attaining the molecular understanding of the molecule
requisite for successfully accomplishing that goal."
10756150,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally. However, a
vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping (i.e., correctly identifying
individuals with a particular trait of interest). Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert
dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. However, each requires an extensive
investment of time and resources to develop due to the heterogeneity, complexity, inaccuracy, and frequent
fragmentation of EHRs. The lack of general, automatic, and portable approaches to enable accurate high-
throughput phenotyping is a critical barrier that hampers our ability to leverage valuable clinical data in EHRs for
better healthcare. We propose a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured,
Automated Profile (PheMAP) that we have developed from public resources and will further refine and implement
across various EHRs. We recognize that mass information about phenotypes is often described in significant
detail and continuedly accumulated within publicly available resources (e.g., MedlinePlus and Wikipedia). We
hypothesize this information can be retrieved, filtered, organized, measured, and formalized into standard EHR
phenotype profiles. Indeed, we have used such an ensemble approach to integrate four generalizable online
medication resources (e.g., SIDER and RxNorm) to create MEDI--a resource linking 2,136 medications and
13,304 indications. In preliminary studies, we extended this strategy to phenotyping and created a prototype
PheMAP. For each phenotype, we identified relevant clinical concepts and weighted each based on its
importance to the phenotype. We then mapped all associated concepts to commonly-used clinical terminologies.
Our preliminary studies showed an average consistency of 98.6%±0.8% between our early-stage PheMAP and
three validated eMERGE algorithms (Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism). We seek support to refine
and optimize PheMAP and develop tools to allow researchers to implement PheMAP efficiently in different EHRs.
This will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions
of individuals with minimal human intervention. Since PheMAP is created using independent resources that are
more generalizable than a local clinical dataset, the implementation will generate more consistent outcomes in
different EHRs for large-scale analyses.The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to conduct
high-throughput genome-wide and phenome-wide association analyses (GWASs and PheWASs). We will use
data from multiple biobanks to accomplish these tasks. Specifically, we will achieve the following goals in this
grant: 1.refine PheMAP and conduct large-scale validation, 2. implement PheMAP and perform representative
GWASs and PheWASs, 3. Use PheMAP to conduct GWASs for unstudied or understudied diseases and
phenotypes, and 4. Share PheMAP to facilitate research using EHRs."

The zoonotic transmission of viral pathogens from animals to humans contributes to the majority of emerging
infectious diseases, which pose a substantial and increasing threat to human health. While host innate
immunity—namely the production of Type I Interferon (IFN) and the subsequent production of Interferon
Stimulated Genes (ISGS) with antiviral activities—plays an important role in determining viral tropism and limiting
the cross-species transmission of viruses, much work remains on identifying and characterizing ISGs limiting
viral tropism. Our lab has determined that while the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and non-human
primate simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) are able to at least partly evade IFN-mediated defenses in cells
from their cognate host, they remain exquisitely sensitive to such defenses in cells from unnatural hosts. Since
HIV-1 and HIV-2 both arose from the cross-species transmission of diverse SIV species, the human and primate
immunodeficiency viruses are a rich model system for studying the relationship between host innate immunity
and viral adaptation. In order to identify human genes inhibiting SIV infection, we have modified a recently
described high-throughput, CRISPR-based screening assay to identify human ISGs with activity against
SIVmac239. Our preliminary data suggests that our model system is working as designed, as had identified a
number of candidate genes that inhibit SIVmac infection in human cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanism of action of novel ISGs with confirmed activity against SIVmac239. We will perform stepwise
mechanistic studies to dissect the point of inhibition in the viral lifecycle. We will additionally perform co-
immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies to identify viral components and cellular cofactors relevant to
mechanism of inhibition. In Aim 2, we will use our established pipeline to screen for ISGs inhibiting diverse
SIV strains. Preliminary data strongly suggests that we will be able to directly use the system we have developed
to screen diverse strains of SIV. We will assess multiple SIV strains for sensitivity to IFN and screen those that
are sensitive for inhibitory ISGs. We hypothesize that there will be both conserved and distinct inhibitory factors
targeting the various SIV species. Combined, these approaches will reveal novel restriction factors that inhibit
diverse SIVs in human cells, providing insight into the evolutionary adaptations that HIV-1 and HIV-2 made in
order to successfully colonize humans."

Heparin is arguably the most versatile biopolymer, capable of interacting with and modulating the behavior of an
impressive variety of biomolecules even outside of its native environment (mast cell granules). A large fraction
of heparin interactome in the human body are key players in a variety of physiological processes (including
several pathologies) and are considered high-value therapeutic targets, although at present antithrombin
remains the only protein whose interaction with heparin has been successfully exploited in medicine. Successful
exploitation of heparin’s unique versatility for other therapeutic purposes critically depends on the ability to
characterize its interactions with relevant proteins; however, specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive
outside of the very few extensively studied systems. In the previous period of support, we developed powerful
analytical tools capable of providing information on protein/heparin interactions at the whole molecule level, as
well as identifying specific structural motifs within highly heterogeneous heparin macromolecules that enable
their association with specific proteins. Building upon this success, we now propose to focus our inquiry on
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying etiology of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a
serious (and potentially fatal) immune disorder affecting up to 5% of patients receiving heparin as an
anticoagulant. Despite the central role played by heparin in formation of antigenic aggregates that may lead to
development of HIT, relatively little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms governing these
interactions. This not only creates a tremendous challenge vis-a-vis the ability to design efficient anti-HIT
therapeutic strategies, but also prevents a reliable prognosis of the occurrence of this pathology. Recognizing
the importance of multiple factors that may modulate interaction of heparin with relevant proteins (mostly platelet
factor 4, PF4), we will use a multi-level strategy to study the mechanism of PF4/heparin association, architecture
of these aggregates and specific features that make them immunogenic and trigger the onset of HIT. The work
will be carried out in close collaboration with the Hematology team at McMaster University Health Centre headed
by Dr. I. Nazy, a leading expert in the field of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. This knowledge will catalyze
efforts to develop reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for HIT, and will be critical for designing safe and
effective therapeutic intervention strategies."

 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
is routinely used in the clinical management of cardiovascular disease and is the standard method for the
assessment of cardiac function and myocardial tissue properties. Today, most clinical CMR studies are still
conducted on 1.5T scanners because of their availability and robustness in executing CMR protocols. In
general, 3.0T provides higher SNR, spatial resolution, and reduced scan time than 1.5T. However, the
increased B0 field strength also poses technical challenges for CMR. A major challenge is the susceptibility or
off-resonance artifacts due to worsened B0 field inhomogeneity.
 In the last two decades, steady-state free precession (SSFP) has revolutionized CMR on 1.5T because it
boosts SNR and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) markedly over gradient-echo based acquisitions. However, its
routine use on 3.0T has been inconsistent despite continuously improving B0 homogeneity and shimming
capabilities. Therefore, gradient-echo based acquisitions are still routinely used, such as for cine imaging,
cardiac relaxometry, and coronary MRA, negating the major advantages of 3.0T for CMR. Due to the distance
of standard whole-body shimming coils from the target organ, they only provide shimming capabilities up to the
second-order spherical harmonic (SH), and are incapable of shimming higher-order localized field variations
such as those present near the heart-lung interface. This remains an unmet challenge.
 In this project, we will apply a novel unified shim-RF coil technique to overcome the primary limitation in
3.0T CMR. We will develop a unified shim-RF coil and validate its safety and high-order shimming capability
(Aim 1). We will develop a respiratory motion-resolved B0 field mapping technique based on our low-rank
Multitasking framework and real-time shim circuits to allow dynamic shimming for free breathing CMR (Aim 2).
We will then validate the technology in human subjects on 3.0T (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project
will enable robust SSFP CMR on 3.0T, a major technical challenge, which allows reliable high-resolution, high-
SNR CMR, including but not limited to cine and coronary MRA. This novel cardiac shimming system has the
potential to have a major impact in accelerating the clinical adoption of 3.0T CMR."

 Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors occupy a prominent role in recent CNS clinical trials particularly with respect
to the use of AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) for single gene genetic disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy and giant axon
neuropathy (Mendell et al., 2018; Bailey et al., 2018). Given the need for selective cellular transduction, capsid
modification, cell specific promoters and cell specific enhancers all have demonstrated success in achieving specific
vector properties (Asokan et al., 2012; Dimidschstein et al., 2016; Grimm and Buning, 2017). In a recently accepted
manuscript, we established a previously unknown interaction between the AAV9 capsid and different constitutive
promoters, namely the ability to directly influence cell specific gene expression in the CNS. Using identical transgenes
and the AAV9 capsid, CBA promoter driven gene expression exhibited a dominant neuronal gene expression in the rat
striatum, but when gene expression was driven by the truncated Cbh promoter, gene expression was significantly
shifted to striatal oligodendrocytes. Moreover, an AAV9 chimera containing six glutamate insertions after amino acid
139 in VP1/2 exhibited oligodendrocyte gene expression for both CBA and Cbh driven gene expression while a six
alanine insertion in the same site reversed the Cbh driven gene expression back to neurons. Recently, preliminary
findings revealed a similar AAV9 capsid interaction with the JetI synthetic promoter that influenced cellular gene
expression in vivo. Given the highly novel nature of this capsid-promoter interaction, in vitro studies will define the
mechanisms that underlie the glutamate and alanine shifts in cellular gene expression, including capsid conformation,
intracellular trafficking, RNA splicing and VP1,2,3 interactions. In vivo studies will assess those promoter elements that
contribute to the interactions, and specific AAV9 capsid elements that influence changes in in vivo cellular gene
expression. Given the numerous applications of AAV9 vectors, the findings should significantly advance our
understanding of basic capsid-promoter interactions and prove crucial to future design of AAV9 based gene therapies."

Cognitive and behavioral (anxiety and depression) deficits are two potentially life-altering complications of sickle
cell disease (SCD). Loss of full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), interference with employability, navigation of
healthcare resources and overall quality of life are some of the consequences of cognitive deficit in SCD patients.
The molecular and cellular factors that mediate the development of these complications are still largely unknown.
This proposal aims to define the role of neuroinflammation in development of abnormal neuroplasticity and how
the two are temporally related to onset of cognitive and behavioral deficit in SCD. We will also attempt to identify
some small molecules and treatment strategies that could have utility in prevention and/or treatment of SCD-
associated cognitive and behavioral deficit. Our preliminary studies have shown that sickle cell mice developed
cognitive and behavioral deficit that occur with age and neuroinflammation and thus our central hypothesis is
that the development of cognitive deficits in SCD is due to neuroinflammation and abnormal
neuroplasticity defined by decreased density of dendritic arbors, dendritic spines and, the proportion of
immature dendritic spines. We will also examine the potential role or contribution from cerebral infarcts and
microvasculopathy. This will be rigorously tested with the following aims (1) Determine the temporal
relationship between presence of cognitive (learning and memory) deficit in SCD, and abnormal
neuroplasticity and/or the burden of cerebral infarcts and microvasculopathy. This will enable us to
establish a temporal relationship between the onset of cognitive and behavioral deficit, and onset of abnormal
neuroplasticity as well as the burden of cerebral microinfarct. (2) Demonstrate the role of neuroinflammation,
as well as the therapeutic benefit of minocycline in treating cognitive deficits in SCD. This will be done by
establishing baseline relationship between onset and progression of cellular and molecular evidence of
neuroinflammation and onset and progression of abnormal neuroplasticity as well as development of cognitive
and behavioral deficit. Additionally, we will examine whether blocking neuroinflammation could be a potential
target for the treatment or prevention of SCD associated cognitive and behavioral deficit. (3) Determine whether
treatment with a neurotrophin agonist treatment or anti-neuroinflammatory mediators reverses
neuroinflammation, abnormal neuroplasticity and cognitive deficit in SCD. These studies are design to
enable us identify small molecule(s) and/or small molecule target(s) and provide the preclinical information that
could support a clinical trial geared towards identifying treatment and prevention strategies for cognitive and
behavioral deficit in SCD."
10764197,"Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections
and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for
inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods
for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish
between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the
proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a
testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural
modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI
methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester).
We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had
also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the
participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide
diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian
grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own
preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art
tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require
their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there
are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur
frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for
novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such
an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here
we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing
tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition
protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping.
These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their
intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an
invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective
assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the
development of next-generation techniques."

Rapid growth in access to digital media is accompanied by a scarcity of research examining complex, real-time
family media context and sociocognitive outcomes, driven in part by a lack of comprehensive measurement
tools. To meet this challenge, the PI’s interdisciplinary research team developed a multi-method, scalable,
cost-effective toolkit called the Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Toolkit. The
toolkit is designed to capture the content and context of early media exposure (Barr et al., 2020; Radesky et
al., 2020a). While this toolkit represents a substantial step forward in characterizing the family media ecology,
progress in understanding the effects of media exposure on child outcomes has also been limited by the lack
of large and representative longitudinal datasets, the difficulty of tracking quality of content in an ever-changing
media environment, and the lack of a mechanism to rapidly share and analyze results in a theoretically driven
manner. To overcome these limitations in the field, the overarching goal of this Research Program
proposal is to examine trajectories of media use - characterizing the context, content, and problematic
uses of media - in a diverse group of 1200 children aged between 1 to 7 years, assessing temporal
associations with emotion regulation and social competence using a cohort sequential design. The Research
Program includes three longitudinal studies, collecting data in three cohorts that span the entire age range (1-
3, 3-5, 5-7 year olds). New data collected during the project period will be compared to data collected before
and during the COVID pandemic using the same toolkit to examine how the pandemic altered media exposure
patterns and the relation between media exposure and socio-emotional outcomes. The work described in this
application will also produce research infrastructure to increase the efficiency of coding the quality of media
content, a bottleneck in the field. Finally, the data will be integrated, shared, visualized and analyzed in a
shared analytic research hub. The proposed research is significant because it would be the first synergistic
effort to utilize a comprehensive assessment of the family media ecology in a large, diverse, longitudinal
sample to identify antecedents of problematic media use in early childhood as well as specific media use
patterns that support social and emotional development in early childhood. The proposed work is innovative
because it (1) uses a multi-method, comprehensive assessment of the family media ecology; (2) applies an
ecological lens to study media effects and socio-emotional development within the family system; (3)
maximizes impact and efficiency with synergistic science; (4) streamlines content coding in an ever-changing
media environment; and (5) builds a collaborative platform for cleaning, integrating, and analyzing shared data
for reuse."

The human heart presents remarkable anatomical, cellular and functional heterogeneity, with specialized
cellular structures performing distinct yet essential physiological functions. A significant gap of knowledge is
that different cells’ molecular signature, spatial distribution and interactions, and functional state remain little
understood for the heart. We therefore propose the in-depth characterization of the heart which accounts for a
large fraction of human disease burden. We will map molecular and cellular changes in heart tissues over the
course of human lifespan using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and imaging technologies. The
final product will impact research of the heart in the following manner: 1) Organ Atlases: spatially resolved
atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most comprehensive
multi-omic, single cell analysis of the heart. Molecular data will be richly annotated with additional clinical and
epidemiological data. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical computational tools and
pipelines developed in this project will be available to the research community. These include methods and
pipelines for processing multi-omics and imaging data, inference of cell-specific regulatory and signaling
pathways, correlation of mesoscale imaging and molecular imaging features, as well as database algorithms
for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for follow-up
studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical research
community. These include freshly frozen and fixed specimens and tissue sections. In summary, the proposed
project will broadly impact the entire research community and jumpstart basic-science and medical discoveries
based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits underlying the development and aging of
the heart."

affective impairments. The hallmark pathology, loss of dopamine, has guided therapy for decades; however,
dopamine-centered treatments do not improve vocal communication, cognition, or affect. In fact, prior to classic
dopamine loss, there is significant degeneration in the locus coeruleus, a norepinephrine-rich brainstem region
that is vital to communicative and cognitive behaviors. Here, we propose to study three different therapeutic
approaches that modulate norepinephrine (exercise, drugs, socialization) based on the rationale that
modulating noradrenergic brain systems will improve PD-related communication deficits, as well as cognition
and affect. We hypothesize that the benefit of these therapies will be improved communication, cognition, and
affect as well as neuroprotection (i.e. sparing of neurons, increased neurotrophins). However, as with any
treatment, there may be unwanted side effects such as anxiety, increased motor errors, or enhanced
neuroprogression (loss of neurons) due to neurotoxicity of drugs. For superior experimental control and to
study underlying neural mechanisms with increased scientific rigor, we will use a well-established translational
rat model. The Pink1-/- rat is based on a genetic form of early and progressive PD (PARK6) that is nearly
identical to idiopathic PD. We have shown communication, motor, cognitive, and affective deficits and neural
abnormalities that are analogous to humans, including early loss of norepinephrine in brain regions important
to communication. Aim 1 will analyze the benefits and side effects of intervention on communication, cognition,
and affect. Pink1-/- rats will be treated with either: (1) cardiovascular exercise, (2) targeted vocal exercise, (3)
methylphenidate, (4) propranolol, (5) social enrichment, or (6) control conditions at 10 months of age, which is
equivalent to human age at time of diagnosed and treatment initiation. Vocalization, attention, accuracy,
memory, anhedonia, and anxiety will be assayed, and effect sizes of each treatment will be calculated to
determine the impact of treatment on all outcomes. Aim 2 will quantify changes to the brain with these
interventions. Rats from Aim 1 will undergo in vivo microPET scanning to determine how interventions
modulate norepinephrine. Ex vivo, brain tissues will be analyzed for neurotransmitter content, cell numbers,
and changes to neurotrophins/receptors in regions associated with vocalization, cognition, and affect using
high pressure liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry. We hypothesize that interventions will result
in either neuroprotection (e.g., increases in neurotrophic factors) or neurodegeneration (e.g., cell death/loss of
neurotransmitter). This work is innovative because it is the first controlled study to robustly assess behavioral
responses to noradrenergically-based interventions and concurrently measures in vivo modulation of
norepinephrine and other important brain mechanisms as a result of intervention. Findings will be readily
translated to directed human clinical trials to combat this devastating human health problem."
10757333,"The B7x pathway in the tumor microenvironment
 During the first five years of the R01 funding period (April 2014 – March
2019), we produced 37 publications and received 3 granted patents. We made
major discoveries on function and structure of B7x, a much less studied B7 family
member that was originally discovered by us.
 Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have advanced
the treatment of cancer patients. However, one of the biggest challenges is that
the majority of cancer patients do not respond to these treatments. Clearly, new
strategies targeting additional immune checkpoints are needed to improve the
immunotherapy of human cancers.
 Our basic and clinical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest B7x
immune checkpoint has very different mechanisms and provides an excellent
target to develop new immunotherapies. Furthermore, we recently discovered
HHLA2 as a homolog of B7x and a new member of the B7 family, which provides
a unique opportunity to study a new human immune checkpoint. Thus, our
central hypothesis is that B7x and HHLA2, two less-studied members of the B7
family originally discovered by us, are critical immune evasion pathways within
the tumor microenvironment and are therapeutic targets for new cancer
immunotherapies. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three aims: 1)
Dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms by which tumor-expressed B7x
induces immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment; 2) Develop new
immune checkpoint blockade targeting B7x: Combination therapies and
mechanisms; and 3) Elucidate the HHLA2 pathway: A new homology of B7x. We
have generated a number of novel tools which provides us with unique
opportunities to address challenges and realize goals. The outcomes of this
project will reveal new immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment and will establish the foundation for clinical design of new
immunotherapies, which could potentially be effective in tumors that resist
current PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 targeted therapies."

Increases in cellular Ca2+ resulting from activation of intracellular Ca2+ channels regulate many physiological
events. Dysfunction of intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways is involved in many disease states. To appreciate
how cell functions are controlled by Ca2+ signals, and how pathological cues subvert their function, we must
understand how the `functional architecture' of intracellular ion channels controls Ca2+ signaling dynamics.
In this proposal, we investigate the mechanistic basis of Ca2+ release mediated by the second messenger
nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). NAADP potently releases Ca2+ from endosomes and
lysosomes by activating a family of cation channels called two-pore channels (TPCs). These signals locally
regulate trafficking of endolysosomal cargoes and can be amplified into whole cell Ca2+ signals by Ca2+-
induced Ca2+ release through neighboring Ca2+ channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the
molecular basis of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release is unclear as no NAADP binding site has been identified on
the TPC protein. Rather NAADP acts via an unidentified NAADP binding protein (NAADP-BP) associated with
the TPC complex to mediate TPC activation. Here, a multi-PI team (Marchant, Patel, Slama): (i) designed a
novel bifunctional probe to enable a photolabeling strategy that has identified the elusive NAADP-BP as Jupiter
Microtubule Associated Homolog 2 (JPT-2), and (ii) optimized novel TPC activatory ligands that mimic NAADP
action. These tools provide opportunity to finally decipher the molecular basis of NAADP action. This proposal
coalesces medicinal chemistry, molecular analyses, and high-resolution imaging expertise to resolve:
 (1) How NAADP binds to JPT2, and how JPT2 associates with TPCs. We will define the nucleotide
 binding characteristics of JPT2, and the role of JPT2 in conferring NAADP sensitivity to TPCs
 (2) The functional impact of JPT2 on NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals. We will probe the essentiality and cell
 biology of JPT2, resolving its role in endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals and targeting of TPCs to
 specialized microdomains (membrane contact sites) that couple to endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels.
(3) How NAADP sensitivity is regulated physiologically. Identification of JPT2 provides a molecular
 handle to investigate how cellular NAADP sensitivity is physiologically controlled by regulation of JPT2
 stability. We show JPT2 and TPCs interact with tankyrase, a poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase. We
 hypothesize that JPT2 is a tankyrase substrate, with cellular JPT2 levels controlled by ADP ribosylation."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and many other countries.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~55 genetic loci associated with lung cancer risk.
However, causal genes (and their underlying biological mechanisms) for most of these loci remain unknown.
Gene expression is an intermediate phenotype between genetic variants and disease. DNA methylation plays
a critical role in regulating gene expression. Directly integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and methylomic data
with disease risk can uncover novel disease susceptibility genes and potential mechanisms. However, it is
extremely difficult, if at all possible, and costly to directly profile the transcriptome and methylome in lung
tissues from a large number of cases and controls for evaluating these associations. Herein, we propose a
novel approach: transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and methylation-wide association study
(MeWAS) to identify novel genes and methylation loci related to lung cancer risk using genetic instruments.
These novel approaches have been shown to be very powerful in identifying novel genes and methylation sites
in both GWAS-reported loci and regions not yet revealed in GWAS in multiple recent studies, including our pilot
study in lung cancer. We propose to conduct a well-powered TWAS and MeWAS to discover novel genes and
methylation loci (both potential targeted genes/methylation sites in GWAS-identified loci and genes/methylation
sites in loci not yet uncovered by GWAS) for lung cancer risk (Aim 1). We will evaluate the differences in the
expression levels of TWAS-identified genes and the methylation levels of MeWAS-identified loci between lung
cancer tissues and normal tissues to prioritize genes and methylation loci that may contribute to lung cancer
risk (Aim 2). We will investigate the regulating effects of methylation sites on the expression of promising
genes and evaluate the functions of genes and methylation loci by functional genomics analyses (Aim 3).
Finally, we will perform a serial of functional analyses to evaluate the potential functions of identified genes and
methylation loci (Aim 4). We anticipate that this proposed study will identify a large number of novel genes and
methylation loci for lung cancer risk and provide functional data to improve understanding of biological
mechanisms. The proposed study is highly innovative and cost efficient. Our results will help us to better
understand the mechanistic relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations and how those variations
relate to lung cancer risk, and may lead to the discovery of biomarkers that would facilitate early detection of
lung cancer and the development of targeted gene therapies for personalized treatment."

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive replacement of functional alveolar gas
exchange tissue with collagen rich scar. The accumulation, crosslinking and stiffening of this matrix are
defining features of the disease, and definitive barriers to effective repair or regeneration. Emerging evidence
indicates that fibrotic scar remains highly resorbable under appropriate conditions], a process that appears to
be impaired or absent in humans with IPF. The conditions and pathways that promote fibroblasts (and other
cell types) to resorb collagen rich scar are largely unknown. Development of methods and approaches to
address this critical gap in understanding is the focus of this U01 proposal. We propose to develop model
systems in which ECM deposition and resorption can be efficiently studied in both primary cultured lung
fibroblasts as well as precision cut lung slices (PCLS). Our preliminary data show that under appropriate
stimuli, IPF-derived human lung fibroblasts can be prompted to degrade and resorb fibrillar collagen. We
hypothesize that under appropriate stimuli fibroblasts can be stimulated to not only resorb collagen rich ECM in
vitro, but also resorb scar-associated ECM in the lungs from patients with IPF. We propose to develop and
leverage novel in vitro tools to test this hypothesis, with the goal of identifying biological pathways and
therapeutic interventions that mediate physiologic collagen resorption. We propose to pursue these goals
through two aims. In the first aim we will develop culture systems allowing us to identify the signals that
promote ECM resorption by lung fibroblasts and delineate the molecular mechanisms of collagen resorption.
We will validate these assays for high-throughput discovery and perform a focused screen as proof of concept
of the value of this approach. We will also compare the innate ECM deposition and degradation characteristics
of IPF and control fibroblasts and fibroblast subsets. In the second aim we will develop ex vivo lung tissue
assays to test therapeutic modulation and mechanisms of clearance of scar-associated IPF ECM. We will
characterize baseline and stimulus evoked collagenolytic activity in control and IPF lung tissue, and define the
association of this activity with lung cell types and histopathological appearance of the tissue. We will also test
candidate hits identified in aim 1 for their capacity to increase targeted fibrillar collagen degradation in the
native IPF ECM environment. Together the proposed studies will establish robust models of ECM deposition
and resorption in primary human IPF fibroblasts and ex vivo lung slices. This platform will open new avenues
for identifying signals and mechanisms that shift fibroblasts in IPF toward a matrix resorbing state, generating
new opportunities to develop advanced therapeutics for IPF."
10750955,"Incorporation of multilevel ontologies of adverse events and vaccines
 for vaccine safety surveillance
PROJECT SUMMARY
Vaccines face tougher safety standards than most pharmaceutical products because they are given
to healthy people, often children. Effective and rigorous analyses of post-vaccination adverse events
(AEs) is critical to ensure the safety of vaccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) is a national vaccine safety surveillance program which contains spontaneous reports from
1990 to present. Statistical approaches have been used on VAERS to extract important signals
hidden in this large, complex database and offer a hypothesis-free view of the safety characteristics in
the underlying data. However, existing methods may miss detecting serious AEs due to modeling
under the false assumption of independence between different types of AEs.
In response to the FOA, PA-18-873, this proposal addresses the specific objective:
“creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data
available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases.”
We propose to develop a series of methods for vaccine safety surveillance while incorporating
adverse event ontology as well as vaccine ontology. Specifically, we will use the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the vaccine ontology (VO) to form the basis of our models for
systematically mining and monitoring safety signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to directly incorporate AE and vaccine ontologies in the signal detection method. Multiple AEs
may individually be rare enough to go undetected, but if they are related, they can borrow strength
from each other to increase the chance of being flagged. Furthermore, borrowing strength induces
shrinkage of related AEs, thereby also reducing headline-grabbing false positives. Additionally,
multiple AEs may collectively point to an underlying adverse cause, combined with additional expert
knowledge from the vaccine ontology, such as vaccine components, we will be able to understand the
root cause of different types of AEs.

10705693,"Background: VA use of prescribed stimulants (PS) has been skyrocketing. PS are beneficial for many
Veterans but can also cause serious risks ranging from cardiac problems, psychosis, mania, substance
abuse, and overdose. These risks have not been well-quantified inside or outside of the VA, and because of
Veterans’ high rates of physical and mental health conditions, these risks may be particularly high in
Veterans. PS will be the focus of VA’s next Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI) starting January 2022.
Significance: PS are potent and useful medications, but are not equally safe for all patients. This study will
use the VA’s very large nationwide databases to comprehensively quantify the risks from PS and identify
those patient groups at greatest risk of adverse effects. Thus, this study will help providers decide who to
start on stimulants, and how to manage patients once started. Because of the upcoming initiative, our study
will be useful to the VA as it seeks to improve PS safety and may have rapid impacts on improving care.
Innovation and Impact: This study will provide: 1) the first comprehensive look at the magnitude and
frequency of many PS risks; 2) a unique resource to support VA’s program offices as they set quality
improvement targets and seek to improve PS prescribing practices during and after the PDSI; 3) an
opportunity to confirm or refute the reported association between PS and mortality risks in patients receiving
PS “off label”; 4) the first systematic investigation about events during PS treatment, including tox screens and
the detection of duplicate prescriptions,that may signal increased risks for adverse effects; 5) a chart review
examining whether undiagnosed substance use may contribute to PS risks; 6) development of a risk score to
communicate our findings to providers, and help facilitate their discussions of PS risks with patients.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify Patients at Particular Risk from PS; Aim 2: Identify Other Prescribing
Practices at or after PS Initiation Associated with Increased PS Risks; Aim 3: Develop Risk Scores (RS) to
Facilitate Risk Perception & Collaborative Decision-Making re: PS.
Methodology: This study primarily uses the VA’s large and detailed clinical databases, analyzed by high-
dimensional propensity scores and marginal structural models. These methods help address confounding,
which can sometimes lead to inaccurate conclusions from database information. Some of these methods also
can be implemented rapidly to provide a broad survey of risks, allowing the VA to use Veteran-specific data to
prioritize their safety efforts as the PDSI proceeds. Automated chart extraction concerning duplicate
prescriptions and a manual chart review concerning substance use will add detail to these PS risk
assessments. Risk scores for several different outcomes will be constructed by assessing risk factors identified
in Aim 1 & 2 plus those identified by random forest methods by iterative mixed effects logistic regression
models. The single most useful risk score, or risk score for a composite of several outcomes, will be chosen
with program office input, and this automatically-generated risk score will be formatted similar to VA’s existing
opioid risk score to facilitate similar use of the risk score using the program office’s clinical dashboard.
Next Steps: Given the ongoing PDSI initiative, this study’s findings have the potential to immediately help
Veterans through the team’s close relationship with program offices, who have well-established pathways for
communicating with providers. Since a similar opioid tool is already familiar, follow-up work may include VA
implementation of the risk score through a hybrid trial or, since a similar opioid tool is already in used,
through widespread adoption at VA’s with pre/post data gathering concerning patient safety events. Other
follow-up research may examine areas in which the PDSI did not change practices as much as expected, or
develop new approaches to communicate with providers, or new tools to assist them. This study will
contribute to improving care for thousands of Veterans receiving prescribed stimulants each year."
10756466,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive
disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and
psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of
depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers
is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field
models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural
information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association
between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of
dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us
understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately
personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre-
treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate
the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3)
expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated
feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model
developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this
externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University,
and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS
treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in
Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of
antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine
learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and
depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve
clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment
response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale
data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the
preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims
outlined in this proposal.

10747919,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 The overarching goal of our research is to improve the management and health of an estimated 1 million
Americans suffering from end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis) through non-invasive MRI-based blood flow
measurements. In cirrhosis, increased resistance to blood flow leads to formation of collateral vessels that shunt
blood away from the liver. Many forms of collaterals can develop, but gastroesophageal varices (GEV) are the
most important to monitor - GEV are fragile submucosal vessels that can rupture without warning and cause
fatal internal bleeding. Once bleeding starts, mortality is extraordinarily high: 1/3 of patients who bleed will die.
Current clinical guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) surveillance every 1-3 years, to
facilitate prophylactic treatment and avoid life-threatening bleeding. Unfortunately. EDG is invasive, expensive,
and requires sedation. Importantly, most patients undergoing EGD do not have treatable varices, and compliance
with surveillance is very poor. For these reasons, the AASLD has identified the development of non-invasive
markers that predict the presence of high-risk varices as a major unmet need in the management of
cirrhosis. We aim to address this need through development of non-invasive MRI-based markers of portal blood
flow that leverage the primary biological mechanism for development and rupture of GEV: reversed flow from
the portal circulation into GEV via the left gastric vein. Currently available markers include catheter-based hepatic
venous pressure gradient measurements, and emerging non-invasive markers such as platelet-to-spleen ratio,
and liver and spleen stiffness (using ultrasound or MRI). Unfortunately, these markers only provide a global
assessment of liver disease, and do not have the specificity necessary to identify high-risk GEV. The
investigative team at UW are pioneers in radial 4D flow MRI for comprehensive hemodynamic characterization
of blood flow in the liver. Our pilot data demonstrates that radial 4D flow MRI can accurately identify high-risk
GEV, by quantifying reversed flow in the LGV, with high sensitivity and specificity. We propose to translate
advanced 4D flow MRI to address this unmet clinical need by overcoming remaining technical challenges,
performing preclinical validation and optimization, and determining its diagnostic performance. Aim 1:
Technical development of velocity-optimized, accelerated 4D flow MRI, to quantify flow in the portal circulation,
in < 3 minutes. Aim 2: Rigorous validation of the proposed method in anatomically correct 3D-printed flow
phantoms. Aim 3: Determine the diagnostic performance of the proposed method in cirrhotic adults
undergoing EGD, to assess diagnostic accuracy and test-retest repeatability. Aim 4: evaluate the effects and
added value of a meal challenge to assess for high-risk GEV. If successful, the proposed strategy would
transform the management of cirrhosis, through: 1) prompt triage of patients to therapeutic EGD 2) reduction
of unnecessary EGD procedures, and 3) increased compliance of GEV surveillance through access to a
non-invasive method, ultimately improving the care and long-term survival of patients with cirrhosis."
10756121,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) affects 0.5~3.2% of the general populations in US and worldwide. Besides
adjusting lifestyle, open surgery and endovascular stent grafting remain the main treatments, though attempts
have been made to develop non-invasive medications. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are innate
lymphocytes that play essential role in obesity, although their total numbers are nearly undetectable (<0.1% of
total lymphocytes). Limited information is available regarding ILC2 in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), although
transplantation of bone-marrow from ILC2-deficient mice promoted atherosclerosis. Eosinophils (EOS) are also
innate immune cells that accumulate in blood or at the site of inflammation after allergic sensitization or
parasite infection. Blood EOS counts and EOS cationic protein (ECP) level associate positively with major CV
risk factors and CVD prevalence and mortality. Yet other studies reported reduced blood EOS counts and ECP
level in patients with major adverse CV events. Therefore, the role of EOS in human CVD also remains
unsettled. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that ILC2 deficiency in Rorafl/sgIL7raCre mice (ILC2KO) or
diphtheria toxin (DTX)-induced ILC2 depletion in Icosfl-DTR-fl/+Cd4Cre/+ mice (ILC2DTX) increased the growth of
peri-aortic CaPO4 injury-induced AAA. In contrast, adoptive transfer of ILC2 or EOS to ILC2KO mice reduced
AAA growth. Further study showed that ILC2KO mice were deficient in splenic and blood EOS and plasma IL5,
an essential ILC2 type-2 cytokine that controls EOS development in the bone marrow and EOS migration to
the peripheral. Administration of mouse recombinant IL5 recovered blood EOS loss in ILC2KO mice, providing a
mechanistic explanation of ILC2 activity in blocking AAA growth and suggesting a concurrent beneficial role of
EOS and ILC2 in the aortic wall. In AAA patients, we detected significantly higher blood EOS counts than in
patients without AAA. Blood EOS counts served as a significant and independent risk factor of human AAA.
EOS accumulated in human and mouse AAA lesions. Yet, EOS deficiency in ∆dblGATA mice accelerated AAA
growth. Adoptive transfer of donor EOS from wild-type (WT) mice or administration of mouse recombinant EOS
cationic protein mEar1 reduced AAA growth in ∆dblGATA mice. Mechanistic studies suggested a role for EOS
and EOS-derived IL4 and mEar1 in promoting M2 macrophage polarization and in reducing IFN-γ-induced
Ly6Chi monocyte expansion, macrophage NF-κB activation, and neutrophil endothelium adhesion. The central
hypothesis is that ILC2 release type-2 cytokines, such as IL5 to promote EOS development in the bone-
marrow and EOS accumulation in the aortic wall where EOS exert a similar role to that of ILC2 in protecting
aortic wall from AAA lesion growth. We propose two Aims to examine whether and how ILC2 promote or
attenuate experimental AAA growth and to explore EOS-mediated aortic protective mechanisms in response to
AAA development."

Title: Biased PAR1 Agonism in Sickle Cell Disease
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the β-globin gene, resulting in
altered red cell physiology that drives chronic hemolytic anemia and painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC)
triggered by microvascular occlusion/stasis. VOC is the leading cause of hospitalizations of sickle cell
patients. Activation of the main thrombin receptor, protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1), enhances the
interactions between endothelial cells and sickle RBCs. In my recently published study, I demonstrated
that PAR1 deficiency on nonhematopoietic cells or inhibition of PAR1 with vorapaxar attenuates
microvascular stasis in a mouse model of SCD. In addition to thrombin, PAR1 is also activated by
activated protein C (APC). The APC-mediated activation of PAR1 is referred to as “biased agonism”
because it activates a different signaling pathway than thrombin and ultimately induces cytoprotective
and anti-inflammatory effects. My central hypothesis is that canonical thrombin/PAR1 signaling
contributes to microvascular stasis whereas non-canonical APC/PAR1 signaling reduces microvascular
stasis and thromboinflammation. I hypothesize that inducing beneficial PAR1 biased signaling will be
advantageous compared to complete PAR1 inhibition, which blocks the deleterious thrombin-
dependent signaling as well as beneficial APC signaling. In the first aim I will compare the roles of
thrombin/PAR1 and APC/PAR1 signaling on coagulation, inflammation, and microvascular stasis in
sickle cell mice using mice with PAR1 point mutations that select for activation by either thrombin or
APC. In the second aim, I will compare the therapeutic potential of a signaling-selective form of APC,
3K3A-APC, to two inhibitors of PAR1, parmodulin 2 and vorapaxar, on inflammation, microvascular
stasis, and acute chest syndrome. Finally, in the third aim, I will investigate the effects of biased PAR1
agonism on mortality and end-organ damage in sickle mice. These studies will investigate the role of
biased PAR1 signaling in the pathology of SCD."
10799549,"Protein S (PS) is a unique protein because it functions non-enzymatically as an anticoagulant,
and because it interacts with plasma components that function in both hemostasis and
inflammation. PS deficiency is a major cause of hypercoagulability that manifests most
prominently as deep vein thrombosis, stroke and myocardial infarction. Many factors contribute
to acquired plasma PS deficiency. One factor is the concentration of sex hormones, especially
estrogen. In women, an increase in estrogen from use of oral contraceptives (OCA) causes a
decrease in PS. Importantly, this contraceptive-induced PS decrease enhances the risk of
thrombosis by 3-fold. Decreased PS levels are also associated with obesity, which enhances
the risk of thrombosis by 2-3 fold. Dramatically, the risk of thrombosis increases as much as 24-
fold in obese women using OCA. Because 40% of the US female population is obese and 10%
of females is morbidly obese, thrombotic complications represent a sizeable clinical side effect
among premenopausal women using OCA.
We will determine the biochemical and molecular basis for the dramatic increase in the
incidence of thrombosis in obese women using OCA. Specifically, we will answer two important
questions: (1) How do OCA and obesity, individually, cause changes in plasma PS level and (2)
How do OCA and obesity synergistically elevate thrombotic risk. We have preliminary findings
suggesting that two key transcription factors, HIF1α, which is active in obesity, and ERα, which
is responsive to estrogen, individually repress expression of the PS gene, and, importantly,
cooperate to still further, synergistically reduce PS gene expression. To assess the activities of
HIF1α and ERα in various states, we will use in vitro assays, ex vivo assays, cell-based assays,
and mouse models to measure PS expression in the presence of HIF1α and ERα. In addition,
we will test several methods to augment PS levels in obese, OCA-treated mice to reduce the
incidence of thrombosis. Our studies will provide the impetus to devise novel therapies for the
significant risk of thrombosis in the female population."
10750941,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
HLA-B*51 in epistasis with the ERAP1 haplotype Hap10 confers the strongest currently known risk for Behcet’s Disease (BD) and Behcet’s Eye Disease (BED), but the consequences of this relationship for immune-phenotype, clonality, and function, are entirely unknown. The main objective of this application is to identify these consequences. This is in line with our long-term goal to find, comprehend, and correct aberrancies in immune pathways that drive Behcet’s Eye Disease (BED).
Based on our preliminary studies we propose as our central hypothesis that ERAP1 Hap10 shapes immune responses in HLA-B*51+ BED through the activation of clonal CD8 T and NKT effector cell populations that drive the disease. We follow the rationale that elucidation of the biological consequences of HLA-B51/ERAP1 Hap10 will promote a mechanistic understanding of BED in affected carriers, and therefore enable targeted therapy design.
We will test our central hypothesis in two specific aims: 1) Through the determination of immune phenotypes linked to HLA-B*51+/ERAP1 Hap10 BED, combining access to unique patient cohorts of our own and those of our international collaborators with large-scale flow cytometric analyses using computational tools we have developed. 2) Through the identification of clonal effector responses and function in BED patients using single cell-transcriptomics and methods of T cell cloning we have established.
Meeting the objective of this proposal will generate knowledge providing scientific rationale for the design of targeted therapies for BED, which is one of the most devastating forms of non-infectious uveitis with significant prevalence in large parts of the world. We expect additional positive impact by cross-fertilizing research of other HLA-I/ERAP-related diseases including HLA-B27-associated uveitis and spondylitis, Birdshot’s choroidopathy, psoriasis-associated conditions, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many disease processes cause profound changes in the mechanical properties of tissue, providing motivation for developing technologies to measure these properties for diagnostic purposes. In addition, over the last decade there has been growing awareness of the importance of tissue matrix mechanics on cellular function. Cells react to the dynamic and static properties of their matrix environment through mechanotransduction and cytoskeletal remodeling. It is now known that mechanobiology has an important role in the origin and evolution of many disease processes, including fibrosis and cancer. The goal of this research is to develop advanced MRI-based technologies for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue and to explore and translate high-impact clinical and research applications. MR Elastography (MRE) is based on the principle that propagating mechanical waves reflect the properties of their medium. Shear waves are generated in the body and imaged with MRI techniques that have the remarkable ability to depict cyclic motions as small as 100 nanometers. The data are processed with inversion algorithms to provide cross-sectional images quantitatively depicting mechanical properties such as the complex shear modulus. In the last grant cycle, the hepatic MRE technology developed under this grant was successfully translated into wide clinical practice and is now used in patient care at hundreds of medical facilities around the world. Liver fibrosis is an important health problem with a rising prevalence in the US population. For many patients, MRE provides a safer, more comfortable, and less expensive alternative to liver biopsy for diagnosing this condition. Research has revealed many other promising applications, including noninvasive diagnosis of fibrosis and inflammation in other organs, detection and characterization of malignancies, providing new biomarkers to assess brain disease, and as a tool in basic research mechanobiology at the tissue and organ scales. As in the last grant cycle, the primary focus of the work will continue to be advanced technology development, to enable further basic and clinical research in this promising field, as well as to conduct pilot studies to identify clincal applications, and to develop practical protocols that will allow validation and eventual translatio to MRE to clinical practice. The research plan involves theoretical work, basic MRI pulse sequence development, device engineering, and protocol testing studies with normal and patient volunteers. Innovative approaches will be implemented and evaluated for generating mechanical waves in tissue, acquiring image data, and processing to generate quantitative images depicting previously inaccessible biomarkers. These technologies will be integrated into protocols that can be shared with other investigators and used to explore the practicality and value of promising applications."
10747966,"Motor axon loss is a cardinal symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Axon loss can be driven
by a genetically encoded program in which the axon survival factors NMNAT2 and STMN2 inhibit the activity of
the axon destruction factor SARM1. Recent data suggest that this program of axon self-destruction may
contribute to pathology in ALS. First, aggregation of TDP-43, a hallmark of most ALS cases, results in the
selective loss of mRNA encoding functional STMN2, a key axon survival factor. Second, loss of SARM1
suppresses some neurodegenerative phenotypes in a mouse ALS model that expresses pathogenic human
TDP-43. Here we investigate the contribution of this axon degeneration pathway to ALS. We have defined the
mechanism of action of SARM1, demonstrating that it is the founding member of a new class of NAD-cleaving
enzymes. SARM1 enzyme activity is normally held in check via an autoinhibitory domain. Injury- or disease-
induced loss of NMNAT2 and STMN2 disinhibits SARM1, leading to rapid NAD+ depletion, metabolic
catastrophe, and axon fragmentation. Our structure-function studies of the SARM1 protein have identified
mutations with a range of consequences, from constitutively active variants that promote cell death and axon
loss, to dominant negative variants that are neuroprotective. These findings imply that human variants may exist
that either promote or protect against neurodegeneration, and that understanding the phenotypic consequences
of genetic variation requires functional studies of enzyme activity. In support of this hypothesis, we have identified
several rare SARM1 variants in ALS patients, but not in controls, that have constitutive NADase activity and
promote neuron death and axon loss. These variants also cause motor dysfunction and paralysis when
expressed in the mouse CNS, suggesting that activating SARM1 mutations may contribute to ALS pathogenesis.
Here we propose to define the function of SARM1 variants from ALS patients, controls, and the general
population. These studies will allow us to categorize SARM1 variants as putatively pro-degenerative,
neuroprotective, or neutral. In parallel, we will dissect the contribution of variation in components of the
programmed axon destruction pathway to ALS phenotypes, alone and in combination with known ALS genetic
risk-factors, in motor neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Finally, we will
investigate neurodegeneration in a mouse knock-in model carrying a Sarm1 allele equivalent to a pro-
degenerative allele found in ALS patients, alone and in combination with a SOD1 model, based on a specific
patient genotype that we identified. We will attempt to suppress ALS phenotypes with SARM1 inhibition via a
proven gene therapy approach and with experimental small molecule inhibitors. Results of these studies will
establish the relationship between the SARM1-mediated axon destruction program and ALS, and build the
foundation to develop axoprotective therapeutics to treat this devastating disease."
10748303,"SUMMARY
 Experience leads to behavioral change through the associated activity of neural circuits. Using this
principle, paired stimulation has been used to selectively strengthen circuits, targeting either the relatively
sparse connections between motor cortex and motoneurons or sensory and motor connections in cortex. In
contrast, we propose to target the spinal cord through the strong interaction of descending motor connections
and large diameter afferents, which mediate the senses of joint position and muscle tension. In rats, sub-
threshold spinal cord stimulation, which activates afferents, strongly augments motor cortex evoked muscle
responses when timed to converge in the spinal cord. When pairing is performed repeatedly, there is robust
augmentation of muscle responses from stimulation of both cortex and spinal cord and improved forelimb
function after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesize that pairing motor cortex and sensory spinal
cord stimulation will promote sensorimotor plasticity in the cervical spinal cord and functional recovery after
SCI. Aim 1 tests the timing of pairing and the source of cortical activity, key issues for proper targeting. Timing
to converge in the spinal cord, as opposed to cortex, is predicted to be strongest. We will also test, for the first
time, spinal stimulation triggered by endogenous cortical activity before voluntary movement versus exogenous
cortical stimulation. Endogenous activity is predicted to be more specific for a targeted muscle. Aim 2 tests the
necessity and sufficiency of specific motor and sensory pathways for the paired stimulation effect in rats with
SCI. Inactivation with chemogenetic is predicted to show necessity, and paired optogenetic or electrical
stimulation to show sufficiency. Finally, Aim 3 tests whether repetitive motor cortex and dorsal cervical spinal
cord over 10 days in rats with SCI will lead to lasting increases in cortical and spinal excitability and improved
forelimb skill. Together, these studies will fill critical gaps about the nature of associative plasticity in the
sensorimotor system and test a new strategy to repair connections after SCI. Our novel strategy will be tested
with innovative tools. To chronically stimulate the cervical spinal cord in awake rats, we have developed thin
(<50μm) electrodes that soften when placed into the epidural space and have proved safe and effective over 4
months. Cortical and spinal electrodes enable both potentially therapeutic paired stimulation and longitudinal
interrogation of the targeted circuits. Forelimb skill will be measured with a forelimb supination task we
invented, as well as tests of skilled walking and food manipulation. Inputs to the spinal cord will be manipulated
with circuit-specific viral tools. Thus, we intend to close gaps in our understanding of how paired stimulation of
sensorimotor circuits should be targeted to the spinal cord and whether it is effective for recovery. This
knowledge can change how we target electrical stimulation to induce associative plasticity. Motor cortex and
cervical spinal cord stimulation are safe, so paired stimulation could be translated quickly to clinical trials."
10770409,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 In 2018, ~10 million individuals developed TB disease globally, of which ~1.5 million died; HIV was the leading
cause of death. Ongoing transmission results from an estimated 4.3 million “missing” TB cases along with active
TB cases not retained in care. We will conduct our study in South Africa (TB prevalence=852/100,000 population;
HIV co-infection=>50%), where a recent TB cascade analysis and national TB program indicators report significant
gaps along the entire TB care cascade. Qualitative studies suggest TB stigma as a barrier to case finding, care
seeking, treatment initiation, and adherence. However, few studies have quantified the impact of stigma on the TB
care cascade, fewer have used validated stigma measures, and none have employed prospective, full care
cascade study designs. We propose a 4-aim, rigorous, multilevel, mixed-methods study. We will perform household
surveys, which will be aggregated into community-level data and incorporated into the analysis of all aims. Aim 1:
Utilize mixed-methods to identify and measure individual- and community-level stigma and social
determinants associated with presentation for TB testing among actively referred contacts. We will conduct
a prospective study amongst symptomatic HHCs actively referred for testing (n= 750) to investigate the
relationships within and between the multiple levels of TB and HIV stigma and other social determinants and uptake
of TB testing. Aim 2: Utilize mixed-methods to identify and measure individual- and community-level stigma
and social determinants associated with returning for test results among symptomatic individuals tested
for TB. We will conduct a prospective study of individuals with TB symptoms who passively present to a study
clinic and are tested for TB (n= 1000) to investigate the relationships between the multiple levels of TB and HIV
stigma and other social determinants and returning for or obtaining the test results. Aim 3: Utilize mixed-methods
to identify and measure individual- and community-level stigma and social determinants associated with
LTFU and treatment outcomes among individuals initiated on TB treatment. We will conduct a prospective
study among TB patients initiating treatment (n= 1250) to investigate the association of anticipated, enacted and
internalized TB and HIV stigma on LTFU and poor TB treatment outcomes. Qualitative methods will explore the
trajectory, persistence, and impact of perceived and experienced TB stigma during and after treatment. Aim 4:
Utilize mixed-methods to identify and measure individual- and community-level stigma and social
determinants associated with LTFU from HIV care following TB treatment among co-infected individuals.
Relevant data for TB/HIV co-infected participant previously collected as part of Aim 3 (n= ~600), and additional
HIV outcome data will be used. Through this, we will investigate the presence and potential impact of intersecting
stigmas on retention in HIV care following completion of TB treatment. This study will ultimately inform targeted,
multi-level interventions, rooted in the needs and challenges of communities, theoretically informed, and fully
contextualized, to address the TB crisis in South Africa, and inform similar interventions globally."

Developmental Funds support the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) mission directly through
the provision of resources and indirectly by leveraging institutional and philanthropic assets. Collectively, these
resources expand and enhance cancer research across LCCC in the basic, clinical, population and
translational sciences. During the last five years, these funds have been used to make key recruitments and to
launch innovative ideas through pilot project funding. Through these expenditures, the LCCC bolstered
interdisciplinary and translational research efforts. By objective criteria such as extramural grants funded and
junior faculty garnering national awards, LCCC recruitment efforts have been a stunning success. The
competition for pilot project awards occurs twice yearly both with a general call for innovative ideas and
specific RFAs devised by the Senior and Program Leaders to stimulate ideas arising from the LCCC planning
processes. The awards have initiated new research across the clinical, population, translational, and basic
spectrums, again yielding success in seeding extramural grant funding, broad collaborations, and cancer
related publications. As has been the case over the last decade, Developmental Funds have been a key to
growth, innovation, and the Center’s scientific and clinical impact. The Center distributed over $14.0M over the
5 year period and received a return on investment of $77M. LCCC requests $650,000 in this category, per

The UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
facilitates internal oversight of the scientific aspects of all cancer clinical trials at the University of North
Carolina focusing on the scientific merit, priorities, and progress of clinical protocol research. The system is a
multi-step process with preliminary review by Protocol Office Disease teams (PODs) and the Resource and
Feasibility Team (RAFT) followed by formal scientific review by the Protocol Review Committee (PRC).
The PRC is chaired by Autumn McRee, MD, and meets bi-monthly to review every cancer-related clinical
protocol before it is submitted to The Office of Human Research Ethics’ Institutional Review Board (IRB). The
PRC’s primary function is to ensure the scientific quality of proposed studies. As described in Clinical Protocol
and Data Management (CPDM), PODs and RAFT review protocols for feasibility, quality, and priority before
they are submitted to the PRC. The PRC monitors study accrual and has the authority to close under-
performing trials. During 2019, the PRC reviewed 392 protocols: 156 new studies and 236 active trials for
renewal and monitoring. This represents an 8% increase over the PRMS activity at the time of our last renewal

valuable input and guidance on the services offered. Center members provide feedback through surveys and
serve on SR active internal advisory boards for each SR. Over the last five years, this management process
has provided substantial new infrastructure for the faculty including: 1) an expanded and more robust tissue-
based research pipeline for correlative work, 2) new technologies such as single cell analysis, mass spec
cytometer instrumentation, and a CyroEM, 3) expanded faculty SR leadership expertise in pathology and
biostatistics. The financial and administrative oversight is provided by the Associate Director of Administration
and his staff of 4 FTEs devoted to this endeavor. The SRs are well managed and are well used as
demonstrated by these statistics:
 • 97% of 2018 user-survey respondents stated the SR overall experience was excellent or good.
 • 81% of LCCC Members used a Shared Resource in FY19
 • 82% of FY19 total LCCC managed-Shared Resource users were Center faculty
Importantly, the SRs are cost-effective and provide exceptional value to the members. The Center requests
8% of the operating budget for the SRs from the CCSG. This is greatly leveraged through a sustained annual
institutional commitment of over $10M in operational support, 37% of the total SR operating budget. The

Xenografts (CDX) models and Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) models are central to LCCC basic and
translational research. This is an endeavor that the LCCC and UNC helped to create through the work of the
late Oliver Smithies who won the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking techniques to allow creation of gene
modified mouse models. The AM SR has grown dramatically in scope and usage over the last 20 years and is
now composed of services for the creation, investigation at multiple levels and imaging of animal models of
cancer. These services include: innovative methods for transgenic/knockout allele production and design,
generation of PDX models from primary human tumors, allele phenotyping and colony management, animal
imaging and tumorigenicity studies in CDXs (both syngeneic immunocompetent and immunocompromised
models), PDXs and GEMMs.
The AM SR assists Cancer Center members in the planning and execution of carefully designed animal
studies. The availability of this SR and its highly skilled personnel eliminates the need for Cancer Center
investigators to hire similar individuals within their laboratories and ensures a high level of rigor and

10812315,"Project Summary/Abstract
A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a disease process that involves dilation of the vessel caused by a weakening of its
wall. This dilation of the aorta has the potential to lead to rupture and death unless treated with a dramatic
surgical intervention to replace the diseased aorta. Indications for surgery largely rely on size and often fail to
capture all of those at risk for rupture and death. While various theories have been put forward, the molecular
and biomechanical causes of aortic wall weakening have not been elucidated. Consequently, novel therapies to
prevent or reverse this disease process have not been produced.
The aortic wall consists of three layers identified as the intima, media, and adventitia. In aortic aneurysm, smooth
muscle cell death and elastin fiber fragmentation is typically observed in a process termed cystic medial
degeneration. While many studies have previously focused on the aortic media, recent work has placed focus
on the outer layer of the aorta. The aortic adventitia contains numerous small blood vessels known as vasa
vasorum which provide blood flow to the outer half of the aortic wall. The vasa vasorum are made up of
endothelial cells and supportive pericytes which regulate flow through these vessels. A recent study in our lab
has revealed deficient and dysfunctional vasa vasorum in aneurysmal human aorta. Hypoxia in the outer half of
the aorta and a decrease in growth factors associated with blood vessel formation were also observed. Based
on this knowledge, we posit that a reduction in perfusion from vasa vasorum dysfunction leads to hypoxia and
subsequent aortic wall weakening. This study aims to examine this disease process at the level of the pericytes
which support the vasa vasorum. Preliminary findings have revealed that human aortic aneurysm-derived
pericytes involved in the formation and maturation of vasa vasorum are dysfunctional. In addition, extracellular
matrix (ECM) from human aneurysmal aortic tissue produces deleterious effects on normal aortic pericytes and
endothelial cells. Given these findings, we hypothesize that aortic aneurysm arises from dysfunction in the cells
and extracellular matrix that contribute to vasa vasorum formation.
Specific Aim 1: Compare function of vasa vasorum pericytes and human adventitial ECM from aneurysmal and
normal aortic tissue
Specific Aim 2: Investigate therapeutic applications of porcine ECM in rabbit aneurysm model
Through this study, we seek to identify targets for novel therapeutic biomaterials such as porcine extracellular
matrix hydrogel. Our long-term goal of this project is to improve identification of those at risk for aortic dissection
or rupture and to provide less-invasive treatment modalities that prevent the sequelae of thoracic aortic disease."
10754568,"Project Summary
Reactivation of toxoplasmosis is a significant health threat to people chronically infected with
this parasite and is life-threatening to infected individuals that are or become
immunocompromised. Millions of people face this threat as it is estimated one third of human
populations are infected with this pathogen. Recrudescence of the Toxoplasma bradyzoite
tissue cyst is the cause of toxoplasmosis reactivation, which can not be prevented as there is no
current treatment that eliminates the dormant tissue cyst in chronically infected individuals.
Approaches to find therapeutic solutions to treat and prevent chronic toxoplasmosis have
suffered from limited accessibility to the relevant Toxoplasma stages and a lack of accurate in
vitro developmental models. Our goal in this proposal is to breakthrough these impasses. We
have developed a new innovative ex vivo model of bradyzoite recrudescence that we will utilize
to define the host cell specificity (Aim 1a), whole-cell gene expression (Aim 1b) and metabolic
changes (Aim 2) that unfold when a bradyzoite converts back to the tachyzoite and also in a
newly discovered alternate pathway where bradyzoites directly replicate to reform the tissue
cyst. This information is critically needed in order to understand how we might prevent
toxoplasmosis reactivation. The loss of developmental competency in vitro that is exacerbated
in current protocols producing transgenic strains is also a major impediment to understanding
the molecular basis of tissue cyst reactivation. In this proposal, we will implement and optimize
an innovative approach to generate developmentally competent transgenic strains (Aim 3a), and
use this new protocol to define cyclin and other protein mechanisms (Aim 3b) that have critical
roles in regulating bradyzoite recrudescence and tissue cyst re-formation"
10871674,"Background: Enhancing access and use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments and eliminating
tobacco-related health disparities are top national and VA health services priorities. The prevalence of tobacco
use is greater among Veterans compared to non-Veterans. From 2010-2015, 29% of women and 21% of male
Veterans reported current cigarette smoking. Evidence-based cessation treatments (EBCTs) such as, tobacco
quitlines, behavioral counseling, and pharmacotherapy, are greatly underutilized by Veteran smokers. Gaps
remain in reaching women Veterans and use of existing social support networks to enhance use of EBCTs and
cessation among Veterans
Innovation and Impact: This project is innovative for evaluating social support networks as a proactive
outreach approach to enhance cessation treatment utilization among Veteran smokers. The role of social
network influences and social support on successful smoking cessation is established. Based on Cohen’s
theory of social support, our team developed a social support intervention for diverse family members, friends,
and other adults who wanted to help a smoker quit. The intervention consists of written materials and a 1-call,
15-25 minute coaching session. It is expected to be especially beneficial for Veteran smokers who might not
otherwise access cessation treatment. Because our prior VHA trials enrolled about 94% men and the higher
smoking rates among women, we will oversample women to enroll an equal number of men and women
smokers. Our study contributes to VA HSR&D’s priority initiatives for enhancing treatment access and
women’s health and is significant because it will advance research on the role of partnering with Veterans’
families and/or important others to enhance access to VA healthcare and population-specific treatments,
especially women Veterans. The potential reach and public health impact of an effective social support
intervention for the Veteran tobacco user population is considerable.
Specific Aims: (Aim 1) To evaluate the impact of the social support intervention on Veteran smokers’ use of
EBCT, (Aim 2) To examine the effectiveness of the social support intervention on the biochemically confirmed
7-day point prevalence cigarette smoking abstinence, (Aim 3) To explore potential moderators (e.g., smoker
gender, SP tobacco use status) of intervention effects on study outcomes, and (Aim 4) To conduct a process
evaluation assessing implementation outcomes (reach, adoption, fidelity) of the social support intervention and
multilevel factors that may influence implementation.
Methodology: We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) within the national VHA health
system to evaluate the effectiveness of a social support intervention compared with a control condition on
utilization of EBCT among VHA-enrolled smokers. Veteran smokers, regardless of level of readiness to quit,
will be identified nationally using the VHA electronic health record and proactively recruited. Interested
smokers will be asked to identify a support person (SP) who will enroll. Participants will be randomized as
smoker-SP dyads to the intervention (n= 594 dyads) or control condition (n= 594 dyads). All smokers will
receive written resources and information on EBCTs. All SP participants will receive written materials. SP
participants assigned to the intervention group will additionally receive a 1-call coaching session. Assessments
for dyads in both study groups will be conducted at baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-randomization.
Implementation/Next Steps: Next steps depend on the actual results, but we expect findings to be important
to VA leaders, the VA Women’s Health Research Consortium and the Veteran community. We will maintain
communication throughout the project with VA program partners to share findings in a timely manner. We will
collaborate with CCDOR’s Veteran Engagement Panel on development of patient-centered dissemination
approaches and recommendations for future intervention adaptations and/or implementation."
10731738,"The objective of this CDA-1 proposal is to launch my independent research career in the area of mobility function
and rehabilitation in Veterans with neurological impairments. Specifically, I am interested in the neural control of
turning while walking, which is often impaired for older adults and people who have had a stroke. Leveraging my
prior training and experience in assessing and analyzing turning performance, I am proposing to expand my
skillset by adding training in clinical trials, neuroimaging, and neuromodulation. I have assembled a mentoring
team of experts in these particular fields who hold faculty appointments at Malcom Randall VA Medical Center
and the University of Florida. This CDA-1 proposal is supported by the infrastructure of Dr. David Clark’s (primary
mentor) ongoing Merit Review study that aims to determine the effects of prefrontal transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) in augmenting complex locomotor learning in older adults with mobility impairment. Recent
research from Clark and colleagues indicates that the prefrontal cortical networks play a critical role in the control
of complex walking tasks and the acquisition and consolidation of new motor skills (as suggested by
neuroimaging and neuromodulation studies). These findings provide the scientific basis for the parent Merit
Review study and supports the innovative use of tDCS as an adjuvant to enhance training for complex walking
tasks. Dr. Clark’s novel complex locomotor learning protocol trains study participants to practice complex walking
tasks such as walking over obstacles, over compliant (soft) terrain, and turning. While assessing a variety of
functional gait measures, the parent Merit Review study does NOT include turning as an outcome measure.
Turning assessments proposed in this CDA-1 will be a novel addition to the study. Notably, turning is a complex
movement requiring neural control, movement planning, dynamic balance, and coordination. From the moment
we wake up, to when we fall asleep, nearly half of our steps incorporate some degree of a turn, which can result
in serious injury if performed poorly. For instance, a fall while turning is eight times more likely to result in a hip
fracture compared to a fall while walking straight ahead. Additionally, prolonged 360˚ turn duration in older adults
is strongly associated with increased fall risk, loss of independence, and reduced walking speed. However, our
understanding of the specific characteristics and mechanisms of declines in turning function remain poorly
understood, and the potential for restoration of turning function is uncertain. The proposed CDA-1 will study
whether tDCS combined with a complex walking intervention can specifically enhance turning performance.
Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to elucidate whether tDCS and complex locomotor learning can
enhance turning performance and furthermore, identify associations between gains in turning performance and
baseline measures of cognitive function, neuroanatomical structure and function (measured with magnetic
resonance imaging; MRI), and [neurophysiological function (measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation;
TMS)]. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that turn related performance gains and retention for the 360˚ and
180˚ turns will be greater for the active tDCS group vs. the sham tDCS group. To test this, we will measure
turning performance at four distinct timepoints (baseline, 1-day, 1-week, and 1-month post intervention) using
wireless inertial sensors. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that larger turning improvements on the 360˚
and 180˚ turn tests will be associated with – greater baseline working memory (2a), greater baseline gray matter
volume (2b), and greater baseline functional network connectivity (2c). [Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis
that participants with greater baseline cortical inhibition (measured by TMS) will demonstrate larger 360˚ and
180˚ turning performance gains.] This pilot study will enroll 40 mobility compromised older adults and 10
participants post-stroke which will provide preliminary data for a future CDA-2 grant submission, proposing a
larger scale clinical trial of turning rehabilitation for mobility compromised Veterans. The long-term objectives of
this research are to improve turning performance, mitigate fall risk, and improve the quality of life for Veterans."
10986964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that maintain immune self-tolerance and mediate recovery
from viral pneumonia by resolving lung inflammation and orchestrating tissue repair after lung injury. Treg cells
also display metabolic plasticity; they modulate which substrates they acquire and how they metabolize them to
support their functions in metabolically stressful microenvironments. AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK)
serves as a master regulator metabolic homeostasis by inducing energy-replenishing processes during energetic
stress. AMPK promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (via epigenetic induction of the mitochondrial mass-promoting
molecule PGC-1α) and long-chain fatty acid oxidation (LC-FAO, via activation of the mitochondrial LC-FA
importer CPT1) in states of energy depletion. Treg cells have high levels of AMPK, and pharmacologic activation
of AMPK induces Treg cell generation in vitro and in mouse models of lung disease. Surprisingly, Treg cell-
specific loss of AMPK in vivo does not lead to spontaneous lethal autoimmunity or other signs of Treg cell dys-
function, suggesting that AMPK is redundant in Treg cells at homeostatic conditions. To explore the role of AMPK
in the Treg cell response to pathologies associated with metabolic stress (nutrient depletion, hypoxia, and
oxidative stress), we bred Treg cell-specific AMPK knockout (Treg AMPK KO) mice and challenged them with
either intratracheal instillation of influenza virus or subcutaneous engraftment of B16 melanoma tumors. While
influenza virus-inoculated Treg AMPK KO mice had lower survival, tumors of Treg AMPK KO mice exhibited
impaired growth and smaller volumes relative to controls. These results suggest that AMPK-deficient Treg cells
undergo loss-of-function in settings of pathology-induced metabolic stress. Therefore, we hypothesize that Treg
cell AMPK-mediated induction of mitochondrial mass and LC-FA oxidation are required for their pro-recovery
function during influenza pneumonia. To elucidate the causal mechanisms through which AMPK promotes Treg
cell pro-recovery function in the injured lung, we will leverage mice with Treg cell-specific deficiency of either
AMPK and CPT1, along with influenza virus infection as a murine model of viral pneumonia. Our Specific Aims
are to determine 1) whether AMPK promotes Treg cell pro-recovery function following influenza pneumonia by
creating a permissive DNA hypomethylation landscape at Ppargc1a (encodes PGC-1α) to sustain their
mitochondrial mass, and 2) whether AMPK-dependent mitochondrial import of LC-FAs is required for Treg cell
pro-recovery function following influenza pneumonia. The PI's excellent mentorship network consists of
experienced scientists in the fields of immunology, epigenetics, metabolism, and lung disease, all of whom will
provide both day-to-day and high-level support during the funding period. The PI's environment is outstanding,
with all necessary facilities, equipment, and expertise to complete the research strategy and training plan."
10689145,"Many Veterans (30.4%) with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to engage in behaviors that increase
risk of cardiovascular events and early mortality, such as smoking or hazardous drinking. While the VA has
several programs designed to help Veterans quit smoking or quit/reduce drinking, there is a gap in service for
Veterans who are not ready for change-based treatments but continue to smoke or drink hazardously. VA
Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) screen all patients annually for alcohol and tobacco use, and thus the
PACT platform is an ideal way to reach Veterans with CVDs who smoke and/or drink hazardously. Through the
Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) initiative, mental and behavioral health providers are
embedded to provide effective, evidence-based, Veteran-centered, behavioral health interventions for a variety
of co-occurring behavioral health concerns and medical problems. Educational and self-monitoring
interventions are evidence-based and increase substance users' intentions to make a behavior change, and
additionally improve patient factors including engagement, willingness to accept behavioral health referrals,
and self-management strategies. This research proposal focuses on adapting elements of these evidence-
based interventions specifically for a PACT-based VA setting to appeal to Veterans not yet ready to change
smoking and/or drinking. This intervention aims to increase intention to change and may improve rates of
cessation and engagement with change-based programs. The intervention will fill a gap in care and potentially
improve the health and longevity of Veterans seen in PACT.
 Dr. Julie Gass is a clinical psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Integrated Healthcare (CIH),
a VA Mental Health Center of Excellence charged with improving Veteran healthcare through PCMHI. The
purpose of this Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) is to facilitate Dr. Gass's transition into an independent
HSR&D investigator with a long-term objective of improving Veterans' health by studying the effectiveness of
evidence-based, Veteran-centered interventions for commonly co-occurring behavioral and medical concerns
within PACT patients. The short-term objective of this CDA-2 is to obtain formal training, expert mentorship,
and research experience to facilitate a VA HSR&D career focused on improving interventions and PACT
processes for Veterans who smoke and/or drink hazardously while diagnosed with CVDs. The CDA-2 will
provide Dr. Gass (who has experience in tobacco treatment/research) with needed training in (1) RCT design,
implementation, and data analysis; (2) team-based care in PC; (3) brief alcohol treatments; (4) qualitative
analysis for intervention development; and (5) grantsmanship, which will allow her to conduct the three projects
comprising the CDA-2 research plan.
 As it is important that any new intervention be accessible and feasible for the PACT and the patient, this
research will use the extant literature, stakeholder feedback, and careful piloting to develop the most feasible
and patient-centered intervention. The intervention will be piloted in this project in two modes: PACT team-
delivered and PCMHI-delivered. Specific Aims of this CDA-2 are as follows. Aim 1, informed by pilot data and
systematic literature review, is a qualitative study both of local and national stakeholders and experts to
understand the preferences, barriers, and facilitators to engaging in conjoint appointments, and to refine the
intervention; Aim 2 is designed to test this intervention in a small sample and make any necessary
modifications; and Aim 3 is a pilot test of the manual in PACT to obtain feedback on the acceptability and
feasibility of using evidence-based substance use intervention techniques in real-world clinical practice.
Results of the CDA-2 will inform submission of an HSR&D merit proposal for a larger RCT to be submitted by
the end of Year 3."
10762997,"Long-term objective. My long-term objective is to explore, identify and evaluate acceptable, feasible and
appropriate techniques and mechanisms to mitigate HIV-related stigma in healthcare, and thereby to improve
the quality of care and outcomes for populations that would otherwise remain deterred from HIV services.
 Specific aims. I plan to integrate stigma and implementation science frameworks to delineate components
of human behavior and environment that influence the manifestation—and mitigation—of stigma during
healthcare interactions. I will target a high HIV incidence population, men who have sex with men (MSM), and a
rarely studied but important marker of HIV-related stigma, anal sexuality. First, I will explore stigma drivers and
mitigators by interviewing 30 healthcare workers (HCWs) responsible for HIV-related screening and care, as well
as 30 MSM, both purposively sampled for diversity and variable comfort discussing anal sexuality during
healthcare encounters. Then I will develop, with an 8-person advisory board of HCWs and MSM, an intersectional
stigma-mitigation intervention to help HCWs navigate discussion of this sensitive topic, improve the quality of
care, and thereby promote prevention. The intervention will include educational mHealth, workshop and coaching
components. Finally, I will pilot the intervention in a stepped wedge hybrid type 2 design to evaluate acceptability,
feasibility, and appropriateness; preliminary impact on HCW behavior (e.g., knowledge, comfort, screening
practices); and remaining barriers. The pilot will be among 120 HCWs working in two high MSM incidence regions
but who do not specialize in MSM care. Aims respond to OAR priorities, including evaluation of interventions that
lead to behavior change by consumers or providers to improve the quality of care and engagement in services.
 Career-development plan. The above aims rely on a robust, mentored training plan that will prepare me for
a career as an independent investigator. My plan involves coursework, directed readings, workshops, and visits
to research labs of mentors, to advance my knowledge, proficiency and capacity across five training goals: (1)
to learn how to leverage health communication to mitigate stigma; (2) to understand how to develop theory-
informed behavioral interventions; (3) to acquire advanced knowledge in mHealth tools; (4) to build expertise in
implementation science to accelerate the uptake of interventions in settings where mitigation of stigma is urgently
needed; and (5) to strengthen professional skills to develop a successful NIH-funded research career.
 Environment. NYSPI/Columbia will host my research and training, with mentorship from a team of internal
experts in sexuality studies, health communication, and workforce development, and external experts in
intersectional stigma (UAB), mHealth (UNC), implementation science (UW), and structural stigma (Yale). In Year
4, I plan to submit an R01 to test the K23 intervention’s techniques, mechanisms, and implementation in a larger
stepped wedge trial, with the goal of reducing incidence and viremia. Skills and findings from this award will be
broadly applicable to HIV stigmas; future technologies, like rectal microbicides; and other related health domains."
10754252,"Summary
 Bone fracture incidence observed in individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is much higher compared to
the general population. The burden of diabetic bone disease is partially due to lack of evidence to support
targeted prevention and interventions to reduce fractures in this population. Furthermore, those with T1D
exhibit skeletal muscle dysfunction associated with decreased muscle strength and muscle mass. Skeletal
muscle and bone communication is a potential modifiable factor that may contribute to development of diabetic
musculoskeletal disease. More specifically, the candidate proposes that a myokine called myostatin, is directly
involved in development of diabetic bone disease and may associate with skeletal muscle dysfunction. The
role of myostatin in T1D and how it affects the musculoskeletal system in this disease are gaps in knowledge
that will be addressed with this proposal. Specifically, the three aims of this proposal are: 1. Quantify the
relationship between myostatin levels in serum and skeletal muscle, and bone parameters of humans with and
without T1D; 2. Quantify the relationship between myostatin levels in serum and muscle and the bone
phenotype of mice with insulin-deficient diabetes; 3. Evaluate whether inhibition of myostatin is beneficial for
prevention of DBD in insulin-deficient diabetes; and lastly 4: Determine the mechanism of action of myostatin
on osteoblastic bone cells under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Myostatin, which is thought to
negatively affect both bone and skeletal muscle, may serve both as a marker of musculoskeletal function and
surrogate for risk for fracture in those with T1D. Additionally, it may offer an opportunity for targeted
intervention to prevent or improve musculoskeletal dysfunction associated with T1D. The knowledge gained
from these studies will set the ground for future studies in musculoskeletal health in diabetes and will offer the
candidate an opportunity to transition towards an independent career in the abovementioned field.
 This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of
muscle and bone interactions in Type 1 diabetes; and specifically, how muscle derived molecules, called
myokines contribute to diabetic bone disease, a serious and emerging complication of Type 1 diabetes. The
candidate currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Pediatric
Endocrinology at the University of Kentucky. She has 75% protected time for research, independent office
space, laboratory space and access to all equipment and resources offered by the Barnstable Brown Diabetes
Center. The candidate is strongly committed to an academic career in the field of musculoskeletal research in
diabetes and is supported by her mentors and her department. The proposed study and the complementary
didactic work will provide the candidate with research skills in basic, translational and clinical research thereby
enabling to transition to an independent clinician scientist."

Over 6 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19.1,2 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent
complication in hospitalizations for COVID-19, which has been associated with poor short-term outcomes,
including in-hospital mortality.3,4 The goals of this proposal are to investigate the prevalence of elevated
albuminuria and other biomarkers of kidney injury and inflammation at 3 months post-discharge in 250 patients
with COVID-19 surviving hospitalization, and to associate these markers with kidney function decline and
mortality at 24 months. This study will also quantify changes in kidney function over time in a larger cohort of
all patients in the Johns Hopkins Health System admitted with COVID-19 (N~2000). The candidate
hypothesizes that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who develop clinical AKI and survive to discharge will
have significantly greater albuminuria and higher levels of biomarkers of kidney injury and inflammation at 3
months post-discharge, and these phenotypes will associate with worse kidney outcomes and mortality up to
24 months. Further, he hypothesizes that patients with clinical AKI in the hospital will have worse kidney
function decline and higher mortality at 24 months than patients without clinical AKI."

10740880,"Project Summary:
Mammalian skin and its appendages function as the outermost barrier of the body to protect
inner organs from environmental hazards and keep essential fluids within the body.
Homeostasis and integrity of mammalian skin are maintained by multiple progenitor and stem
cell populations residing in distinct skin compartments such as basal cells in the interfollicular
epidermis and bulge stem cells in hair follicles. In epithelial cells, cell adhesion, migration and
proliferation are fundamental properties that are controlled by many mechanisms. Among key
regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that take essential roles
in mammalian gene regulation in diverse cell types and tissues. Despite modest regulation of
individual targets, miRNAs broadly modulate a large number (60%) of genes and play important
roles in a wide range of biological processes. In mammalian skin, the critical functions of the
entire miRNA pathway in both embryonic skin development and maintenance of adult HF
lineages have been well appreciated. In contrast, the knowledge of individual miRNAs for their
targets and function remains scarce. Importantly, similar to other regulators, how miRNAs
regulate cell migration and proliferation has not been examined in the context of intact skin in
live animals. To address these important issues, we have developed techniques to directly
capture miRNA and their targeted mRNA fragments and to image cell migration and proliferation
as well as cytoskeleton dynamics in intact skin of live animals. Using these state-of-art tools
together with our mouse models, we find that miR-205, the most highly expressed miRNA in
epithelial stem cells, promotes cell migration by targeting components of adherens junctions,
actin cytoskeleton and mechanosensing genes in both epidermis and hair follicles. In this
project, we will further examine how miR-205-regulated cell migration alters the balance
between epidermal proliferation and differentiation in the epidermis (Aim 1); how miR-205-
induced cell migration triggers hair follicle growth in young and aged mice and how enhanced
hair follicle growth affects hair follicle stem cells (Aim 2); and probe how the loss of Piezo1, a
mechanically activated ion channel and a new miR-205 target, governs the quiescence of hair
follicle stem/progenitor cells (Aim 3). Taken together, studies proposed here, if successful, will
significantly enhance our knowledge about mechanisms mediated by individual miRNAs that
govern cell migration and proliferation in live animals. The knowledge gained from these studies
under normal and stressed conditions will pave the way to manipulate miRNAs and utilize
epithelial stem cells for regenerative medicine."
10757370,"Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) sustain the production of all blood and immune cells throughout life by
differentiating into all blood lineages and regenerate long-lived HSC, ie self-renew. However, although HSC
have high regenerative potential, the actual capacity of ‘self-renewal’, ie regenerating a daughter cell that has
identical properties’ is limited. It is known that HSC progressively lose regenerative potential with divisional
history. A clear understanding of the mechanism responsible for HSC functional decline under homeostatic
conditions is still lacking. This lack of knowledge has hampered our ability to maintain HSC functions through
divisions. The overall goal of this grant application is to understand which physiological mechanisms get
triggered in HSCs with replication, which reduce the activity of the HSC pool. We have discovered that once
HSCs get activated, mitochondria irreversibly remodel and do not return to homeostatic conditions. HSCs
accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria due to a progressive decline in mitochondrial quality control
mechanisms, including reduced mitochondrial turnover and dynamism such that HSCs carry mitochondria have
that are different in shape and functions. Mechanistically, HSC lose mitochondrial fission activity [ie, loss of the
fission regulator Drp1 activity], which causes a decrease in HSC regenerative potential. We hypothesize that
HSC mitochondrial remodeling drives HSC functional decline under homeostatic conditions. The main
objectives of this proposal are to understand the contribution and mechanisms of how changes in the quality
of mitochondria determine HSC functions. Aim1 will further investigate how a change in mitochondrial dynamism
and turnover alter HSC functions. We will examine mitochondria remodeling with HSC replication and the impact
it has on HSC functions; mechanistically determine which molecular pathways drive mitochondrial defects and
HSC attrition; determine the role of mitochondria in human HSC in physiologically relevant models. Aim2 will
investigate mechanisms responsible for the loss of mitochondrial quality controls in HSCs with a focus on
cardiolipin. We will examine the role of cardiolipin as causal factor of mitochondrial dysfunctions in HSCs. We
will test therapeutic potentials for lipid supplementation in ameliorating HSC functions in vivo.
The proposed studies provide a unique opportunity to examine the specific contribution of abnormal
mitochondrial functions to HSC functional decline with divisions under homeostatic conditions. It will investigate
the novel concept that HSCs accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria to drive their functional decline under
homeostatic conditions, perhaps as a mean of HSC internal biological clock, which may lead to the identification
of novel approaches for pharmacological intervention to maintain HSC functions through divisions."
10903713,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cryogenic electron-microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a new and rapidly evolving methodology for structural biology. Its
success is due to advances in Direct Detector Cameras and new algorithms. This proposal seeks to develop
the next generation of algorithms focused on reconstructing the structure of small molecular weight proteins,
proteins with multiple conformational states, and developing algorithms that explain why resolution limits occur
in Cryo-EM.
The proposed research seeks to address important bottlenecks in the above problems. First, we seek to find
useful statistics to detect the so-called “Einstein-from-noise” problem. This problem affects the reconstruction
of small molecular weight proteins, giving catastrophically bad reconstructions. We propose to investigate this
phenomenon theoretically and computationally, so that it can be detected reliably. Second, we seek to develop
the next generation of algorithms for reconstructing multiple conformational states of a heterogeneous protein.
In particular, we seek algorithms which are stable and which give high resolution reconstructions that can be
organized in biologically meaningful ways. Finally, we seek to explore a new direction in Cryo-EM algorithms.
We propose to develop a methodology which explains what causes resolution limits in a Cryo-EM
reconstruction. Current methods can estimate the resolution of a reconstruction without providing any rationale
for its cause. The new methodology will enable users to use data and algorithm settings more effectively.
The proposed research builds on the P.I. previous NIGMS supported work on single particle reconstruction in
Cryo-EM."

research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the
treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating
quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will
include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods,
selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and
performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel
methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an
existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to
create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and
research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that
will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist."
10746104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Objective: The objective of this proposal is to create a novel MRI-guided steerable needle with the potential to
cure epilepsy.
Significance: This work is motivated by the prevalence of epilepsy where 1 in 150 people have the disorder
(3.4 Million in the US alone), with 30% unresponsive to drug therapy, and 1% of all patients suffering sudden
unexplained death each year (i.e. an estimated 500,000 people worldwide – each year!) [1-5].
 Amazingly, a proven intervention (surgical removal of the hippocampus) already exists that can cure
approximately half of the total epilepsy patient population, yet it is rarely performed due to the invasiveness
and perceived morbidity of the procedure [4,6-7]. Our objective in this proposal is to create a novel MRI-guided
steerable needle that performs the same function as surgery, but does so through a simple needle insertion.
Innovation: Our novel steerable needle will thermally ablate the hippocampus, which is the origin of seizures
for 70% of all epilepsy patients. This approach is clinically innovative because it replaces open surgery with
percutaneous thermal ablation. Technical innovation comes from (1) a novel helical superelastic steerable
needle with anatomy-specific shaping, and (2) a novel 3D printed pneumatic robot that is intrinsically safe and
enables real-time MRI guidance and thermometry, with directional laser ablation. We also propose an
innovative new pathway for the needle into the brain, via needle insertion into the patient's cheek and passage
through a small natural opening in the skull base called the foramen ovale. This pathway is currently used
safely for recording electrodes to diagnose epilepsy, but it has never before been used for therapy delivery.
Approach: We propose to create our MRI-guided steerable needle system through three Specific Aims. Aim 1
involves designing our MRI-compatible robotic actuation system and the steerable needle itself. Aim 2 focuses
on MR imaging protocols for needle localization and MR-thermometry. Aim 3 focuses on validation
experiments, including experiments in phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and cadavers to evaluate needle tip
placement accuracy, MR guidance and thermometry, and overall system functionality. These Aims will be
carried out by a multidisciplinary team of investigators combining expertise in epilepsy surgery (Neimat, Naftel,
and Englot), mechanical design and control of MRI-compatible robotic systems (Barth), design and control of
steerable needles (Webster), and MR imaging and thermometry (Grissom).
 The endpoint of this R01 project will be the demonstration of accurate spatial deployment, accurate ablator
aiming, and accurate thermal monitoring to ablate a surgeon-prescribed volume of tissue. This will pave the
way for clinical translation of this technology after the conclusion of this R01 in collaboration with industry
partners (see attached support letters), bringing a potentially curative treatment for epilepsy to many more
patients."
10773046,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating lifelong affliction that impairs a
number of functions including locomotion, breathing, autonomic regulation, and sensation/pain. Unfortunately,
there is no current FDA approved therapy for SCI. Therefore, there is a critical need to translate basic science
discoveries developed in the laboratory with promising effects after experimental SCI towards human
application. SCI elicits an intraspinal inflammatory response comprised of resident glia and infiltrating blood
leukocytes. Although subsets of resident and recruited immune cells have been implicated in CNS repair, more
than 20 years of experimental data in different animal models of SCI indicate that acute monocyte depletion
(MD) is consistently neuroprotective. Further, there are clinically viable drugs, such as clodronate, that can
effectively deplete monocytes after SCI. However, a number of fundamental questions must be answered
before successful translation including, understanding the extent to which injury level impacts therapeutic
efficacy, as well as, understanding the long-term consequences of MD on functional recovery and monocyte
repopulation and fate. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to examine chronic and level-specific functional
changes after acute MD using clinically relevant outcomes including pain, autonomic dysreflexia, respiration,
and forelimb/hand function. We will study the effects of acute liposome encapsulated clodronate treatment for
up to one year in rodent models of cervical and thoracic SCI. Specifically, this grant seeks to: Aim 1: evaluate
the dose-response effects of acute MD on myelopoiesis, biodistribution, and toxicity; Aim 2: determine the
efficacy of acute MD on recovery of locomotor, sensory, and autonomic function in chronic SCI rats. Aim 3:
determine the effects of acute MD on recovery of respiratory motor and forelimb function after cervical SCI.
The combined approach of examining the effects of MD after both cervical and thoracic SCI will provide
unprecedented preclinical data regarding the effects of monocyte function on sensory, autonomic, pain, and
respiratory outcomes. The feasibility of clodronate (aka disodium dichloromethylene diphosphonate) treatment
in SCI individuals was reported almost 40 years ago therefore our proposal is significant as data from our
studies could be adapted to treat human SCI and is expected to be of critical translational impact."
10767897,"ABSTRACT: MICROSCOPY SHARED RESOURCE
The Microscopy Shared Resource (MICRO) combines two outstanding microscopy resources, the Microscopy
Services Laboratory (MSL) and the Hooker Imaging Core (HIC). The MSL provides confocal imaging,
including spectral imaging, spinning disk confocal, standard wide-field imaging on both upright and inverted
microscopes and light-sheet microscopy. The HIC provides confocal imaging on both inverted and upright
microscopes, wide-field imaging, and high-content imaging for visual drug screens. HIC also houses a multi-
photon system for intravital imaging of tissues and organs at cellular scale within a living animal with the option
of re-imaging the same animal over time. Dr. James Bear (CCB program co-leader) oversees the SR as
faculty director and provides broad scientific direction. Dr. Pablo Ariel, facility director, brings experience in
live-cell imaging, image analysis, tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy. He has 10 years of direct
experience in imaging using multiple modalities (widefield, confocal, multiphoton, super resolution, light-sheet)
in multiple subject areas. This is a cost-effective service to the members of LCCC. A useful benchmark for
comparing microscopy recharge rates is confocal microscopy use, ranges from $16 to $32 per hour, depending
on the specific model, at the LCCC MICRO SR. Access to similar equipment at peer institutions ranges from
~$30 to $50 per hour, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of our SR. MICRO SR requests $142,766 for this
facility, 21% of the total operating budget. MICRO is a well-established SR with use by 59 LCCC members in
eight programs, making up approximately 34% of overall users."
10767901,"ABSTRACT: PROTEOMICS SHARED RESOURCE
The Proteomics SR (PROT) is a state-of-the-art facility that brings cutting edge proteomics research to LCCC
faculty. It is a well-established shared resource (SR) that provides consultation for the design of experiments,
sample preparation, mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive data analysis for LCCC members. Directed by an
expert staff, the SR is full service allowing users with projects but little experience to understand the range of
data acquisition opportunities. The SR also has the instrumentation that allows more experienced users access
to expensive, well maintained mass spectrometers. Core staff and expert users have extended the capabilities
with innovative techniques such as the MIB/MS analysis of cell wide kinase activity. Contributions include
validating and characterizing cancer-relevant drug targets, quantifying proteome and signaling network
changes in response to emerging therapeutics, studying the dynamic regulation of the kinome, describing how
specific pathways globally remodel cancer proteomes independent of changes in gene expression, and
determining how protein interaction networks are dysregulated in cancer.
Instrumentation includes; state-of-the-art mass spectrometers include: Thermo Lumos, Thermo QExactive HF-
X, Thermo QExactive Biopharma, Thermo QExactive HF, Thermo Orbitrap Velos and Sciex 5800
MALDI/TOF/TOF. All were partially purchased or leased by LCCC including four within the last four years. The
purchase and maintenance of the current PROT SR instruments are beyond the means of any individual lab.
LCCC investments have made it possible for multiple labs to access high end technology. The cost of PROT
SR services are generally lower by 25% than comparable private company or other academic institutions and
LCCC members receive an additional discount making the facility quite cost effective. The LCCC is requesting
$135,301 from the CCSG, which represents 21% of the total operating budget; 48% of the SR usage is by
LCCC faculty."

10747299,"Project Summary / Abstract
Decades of study have demonstrated that adult human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells have strong
proliferative capacity in vitro, which indicates that the RPE layer has the possibility of self-repair. We have shown
that adult RPE from elderly donors or donors with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can proliferate in
culture and produce a near-native, renewed RPE monolayer. Despite this, RPE cells in vivo do not regenerate
the damaged cobblestone RPE layer in patients with degenerating cells, such as those with dry AMD. The
environment in vivo must effectively prevent repair of the cobblestone RPE monolayer, either through lack of
mitogens or inhibitory molecules or a combination of both. The overarching goal of these studies is to achieve
safe, controlled proliferation of endogenous RPE cells to enable self-repair of the RPE layer in patients with
AMD. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the environmental factors that positively and negatively
control the proliferation of adult human RPE cells. The first specific aim is to characterize the adult human RPE
cell surfaceome on dividing and non-dividing cells using an innovative mass spectrometry and bioinformatic
platform. This will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the molecules on the RPE plasma membrane and
reveal cell surface receptors and secreted proteins that respond to environmental factors impacting cell division.
Investigating both normal and AMD RPE will provide a greater understanding of how RPE cells change with
disease. The second specific aim is to examine a transcriptional network we have identified that is associated
with adult human RPE cell proliferation to determine which molecules are critical. To do this efficiently, we will
first employ CRISPRi, then additional functional screens. The third specific aim will examine whether exogenous
factors can activate proliferation of quiescent, cobblestone human RPE, including those in situ on Bruch’s
membrane explants, and those from patients with AMD. In addition to the main objective, this study will generate
new knowledge about RPE molecules that can be used to target RPE in vivo. The proposed work also has the
potential to improve RPE cell proliferation ex vivo for more efficient cell manufacturing. Most importantly, this
study will create a foundation for safely stimulating RPE cell proliferation in vivo. Endogenous activation of RPE
cell proliferation to counteract RPE cell loss in AMD has the potential to avoid surgery and immunosuppression
involved in RPE cell transplantation, which would greatly benefit the elderly AMD patient population."
10757366,"ABSTRACT
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal
causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents
leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell
immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response
potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.
 The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK
function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process
called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA
allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent
only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present
in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they
likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK
genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and
which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes
and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for
global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.
 HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for
GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a
paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide
dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader.
The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs
in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously
precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data
from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation
and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses."
10673723,"Dr. Kirsch has been a VA RR&D research for 28 years, and a VA RR&D Research Career Scientist since
2007. He has a very active research program and is a leader in both rehabilitation research and academia. His
personal research activities focus on restoring shoulder, arm, and hand movements to individuals with
extensive paralysis due to spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI is a devastating condition that often causes significant
disability and loss of independence. Veterans are historically over-represented in the SCI population, and the
incidence of SCI in more recent military engagements remains high. As a result, the VA Rehabilitation
Research and Development Service has prioritized SCI research, and Dr. Kirsch’s research directly aligns with
this priority. His research specifically focuses on restoring arm/hand movement to individuals with high cervical
(C1-C4) SCI, a condition referred to as high tetraplegia, who have extensive paralysis below the neck. Such
individuals are typically dependent on others for most aspects of care and activities of daily living. Dr. Kirsch
has developed state-of-the-art (1) functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems for powering and coordinating
arm and hand movements in people with high tetraplegia, (2) human brain-computer interfaces that allow users
to intuitively command FES-powered arm movements, and (3) musculoskeletal models of the human shoulder
and elbow that are modified to reflect the specific characteristics of individuals with SCI or other disabilities,
and then used in simulation to explore the feasibility of an intervention (e.g., FES) and to optimize system
design for clinical deployment, substantially decreasing experimental trial-and-error. Dr. Kirsch’s research work
is well-funded, his publication record over the past five years has been very strong (quality and quantity), and
he is a sought-after speaker for seminars and conferences.
 Dr. Kirsch has also undertaken a number of leadership roles in rehabilitation research. He has been the
Executive Director of the VA RR&D-supported FES Center since January 2012. The FES Center is a global
leader in neurostimulation/neuromodulation research that addresses the unmet rehabilitation needs of
Veterans and civilians with neurological disorders. Specifically, the FES Center has 86 investigators (43
scientists/engineers and 43 clinicians) and almost 200 total personnel who perform and facilitate cutting edge
research across 5 different rehabilitation research thrusts: (1) Movement Restoration, (2) Pain Mitigation, (3)
Autonomic Restoration, (4) Brain Health, and (5) Translation and Clinical Dissemination. In addition, Dr. Kirsch
is a leader in translational research, being a co-PI of the of a new VA center entitled the “VA Translational

10812308,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in left heart failure and is present in both heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF afflicts approximately 32
million people globally with five year mortality and readmission rates estimated at 75.7% and 84%, respectively.
PH is present in 83% of patients with HFpEF (PH-HFpEF) and portends worse prognosis. PH-HFpEF is classified
in isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (IpcPH) and combined pre- and post-capillary pulmonary
hypertension (CpcPH). Both forms are characterized by increased pulmonary artery mean and wedge pressures,
but the distinctive hallmark between the two is the presence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in CpcPH,
due to intrinsic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. CpcPH confers increased mortality and
hospitalization risk compared to IpcPH. There are no proven or approved treatments for PH-HFpEF and finding
a treatment has been identified as an unmet need by the NHLBI. We published that mitochondria-derived reactive
oxygen species (mROS) produced by metabolic syndrome and maximal intensity exercise in CpcPH decrease
the expression of the nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase subunit b1 (sGCb1) by downregulating the
expression of the sGC transcription factor Nuclear Factor Y subunit alpha (NFYα). Downregulation of sGC leads
to lower concentration of the vasodilatory cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) impairing pulmonary artery
vasodilation. Additionally, mROS decrease pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) apoptosis and
increase vascular tone by increasing intracellular calcium in PASMCs. The long-term objective of this proposal
is to test mitoquinol, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant as treatment for CpcPH. Mitoquinol was chosen
because it is mitochondria specific, and safe for use in humans, allowing for translation of our findings. We
hypothesize that mitoquinol treatment of PASMCs from rats with CpcPH will decrease mROS formation and
rescue NFYα-sGC expression, increase apoptosis and decrease proliferation of PASMCs (Aim 1); and
mitoquinol treatment of a rat CpcPH model will decrease pulmonary artery pressures by decreasing mROS in
the smooth muscle cell layer of the pulmonary artery (Aim 2). Our lab has established cell culture models to
induce mROS and measure NFYα-sGC expression, cellular apoptosis and proliferation. In addition we developed
a CpcPH rat model and methods to measure pulmonary artery hemodynamics at rest and during exercise.
Cardiac evaluation will be supplemented using ultrasound. Completion of the proposed aims will identify mROS
as a therapeutic target for CpcPH and pave the way for clinical trial design since mitoquinol has been found safe
in humans. These outcomes, in addition to career development, mentored training, and didactic workshops, will
provide the primary investigator with the background knowledge, technical expertise, and leadership skills
necessary to proceed towards scientific independence as a physician-scientist. The objectives of this training
grant will be performed at the Vascular Medicine Institute of the University of Pittsburgh."
10584597,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children of low-income families face myriad social risks that interfere with healthy development, behavior, and
academic achievement. Mothers of these children experience a high rate of depression, itself associated with
lasting effects on children. In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine published a landmark report,
Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Children, in which it called for community-based interventions to prevent
parental depression and to help engage depressed parents in treatment. Consistent with this report, our
research group has conducted a series of NIH-funded studies aimed at alleviating symptoms among mothers
at risk for depression in Head Start – a federally funded preschool program that provides services for ~1 million
low-income US families.
 In the present project, we aim to improve outcomes for Head Start children by deploying a stepped-care
intervention, in which mothers with low level depressive symptoms are offered a prevention program based on
the Problem Solving Education model, and mothers with greater symptoms are offered Engagement Sessions
to link them with formal mental health services. Both components of the model have strong randomized trial
evidence; but they have yet to be synthesized and tested within a coordinated intervention, applicable to a
broad population base. Harnessing a research network of Head Start centers in Massachusetts, we propose
an efficacy trial (n=388) of this stepped-care model.
 Our primary aim is to determine the model’s efficacy in decreasing the rate at which Head Start mothers
experience depressive symptom episodes; mothers’ likelihood of engaging with mental health services when
referred; parental functioning; and child absenteeism from Head Start. Our second aim is to determine
mechanisms of action by which improved maternal wellbeing promotes child resiliency. To do this, we will
assess mothers’ perceptions of stress, family conflict, and mother-child interaction patterns; and we will assess
child outcomes in the affective, interpersonal and cognitive domains. Finally, to prepare for a subsequent
effectiveness trial, we will conduct a single arm pilot study among 20 additional mothers to assess the
feasibility of incorporating intervention delivery into usual Head Start workflow.
 Our proposal represents a high-priority research area for NICHD because it addresses social and
environmental factors that impact children’s adaptive behaviors and school readiness. Our study plan
enhances the rigor of prior research because it tests the efficacy of a comprehensive depression management
model, and because our design allows us to study both maternal and child outcomes – and the mechanisms
that link them – among a true community-based sample. Our ultimate goal is to reduce mental health
disparities for low-income mothers and to improve outcomes for them and their children."
10857549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cerebellum has long been thought to solely process motor information. Yet, there is a growing literature
that points to a role of the cerebellum in processes across multiple domains. Individuals with cerebellar lesions
classically have motor deficits but, in some instances, also have problems with executive functioning, emotion
processing, language, and social cognition. Multiple psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders
(ASD), have been linked to structural and functional differences in the cerebellum. Moreover, numerous
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported neural responses in the cerebellum
related to a host of non-motor tasks. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum is involved in non-
motor tasks, but it remains entirely unclear how the cerebellum contributes to performance on these tasks.
F99 Phase: Models have been successfully developed to explain the role of the cerebellum in motor
processing. These models emphasize the cerebellum's role as a learning machine that modulates and perfects
ongoing processing through the online comparison of reality to an internal model, thereby utilizing sensory
prediction errors. Recent findings in humans and mice suggest that portions of the cerebellum are involved in
reward processing; a process which has primarily been investigated in regards to the basal ganglia. It is
unclear what computational role the cerebellum plays in this reward processing, as the cerebellum has been
said to explicitly operate without reward information. To understand this, the present proposal will use fMRI in
healthy young adults to study the cerebellum's contribution to both traditional (e.g. monetary) and social reward
processing, and to differentiate it from the role of the basal ganglia in reward processing. The training plan for
this proposal includes training in computational modeling methods related to reward processing. It also
includes training in social neuroscience theories and task design. Computational modeling will allow us to
explore parameters that are not easily discernable from behavioral observations of an experiment alone and to
directly test theories about the cerebellum's algorithmic processing, by providing insight into the cerebellum's
algorithmic computations across multiple task domains, and its role in traditional and social reward processing.
These findings will provide insight into the cerebellum's mechanistic capabilities.
K00 Phase: Individuals with ASD exhibit deficits in social cognition and in social reward processing. Structural,
functional, and connectivity differences have implicated the cerebellum in this disorder, with neonatal
cerebellar damage being the second highest predictor of ASD. The K00 phase will investigate how the
cerebellum performs in individuals with autism, who have deficits in social reward processing. The training plan
in this phase of the proposal will focus on learning computational modeling of reinforcement learning and
applying these models to cerebellum functioning with fMRI. The training plan also includes goals to develop
mentorship skills to prepare the applicant to establish a diverse and inclusive independent research laboratory."

This renewal application would provide funding to administer the Neurosurgeon Research Career Development
Program (NRCDP) for another five years. This program is the basis of a continued national effort to support,
train, and mentor junior neurosurgical faculty members at appropriate institutions nationwide. The proposal
addresses the rationale and ongoing need for the NRCDP and includes several proposed innovations to augment
and expand the scope and diversity of the program, the leadership structure, and the rationale for the selection
of the National Advisory Committee (NAC). It also details a well-developed and robust system for the recruitment
and selection of scholar-applicants based on their potential, their mentor’s track-record, and the support of their
Chairs. In addition, there is a description of the Annual Retreat, which includes applicant interviews, symposia
on reproducibility and rigor, interactive grant-preparation sessions, and NIH style “study-section”, where the NAC
reviews applications and selects Scholars.
Eligible candidates are newly appointed neurosurgical faculty within one year of completing residency or
fellowship. Successful applicants are called Scholars. Qualified applicants not selected for funding are called
Emerging Investigators and are also an important part of the program. The primary goal of the program is to
support Scholars along the path to scientific independence. Hence, an important metric is success in securing
subsequent independent funding from the NIH, or other federal agencies. In the 10 years the program has been
in place, we have reviewed applications from 138 individuals, at 75 different institutions, located in 36 states. In
the most recent analysis, we found that the success rate for Scholars obtaining subsequent NIH funding
increased significantly year by year – approaching 85% by nine years. These benefits did not only accrue to
Scholars, but also to Emerging Investigators. Their success rate in obtaining subsequent independent NIH
funding also grew over time, though at a slower rate, and approached 60% by nine years, due to the development
of a parallel path for continued mentoring in the Academy Emerging Investigator Program (EIP).
In this competing renewal, we have identified four important priorities: Goal One: To promote and foster diversity,
equity, and inclusion at all program levels. Goal Two: To create a “Pipeline Program” to recruit the most talented
and diverse group of K12 applicants. Goal Three: To expand the “Training Program” to accelerate timing to
first independent NIH award. Goal Four: Establish an NRCDP leadership structure that embraces continuous
renewal and evolution. Achievement of these goals will lead to a cadre of diverse, independent neurosurgeon-
scientists that perform ethical, rigorous, and high-impact research into the pathogenesis and treatment for many
of most disabling disorders affecting the nervous system."
10707006,"Project Summary/Abstract
One debilitating feature of aging is the loss of cognitive abilities, especially memory decline. Alzheimer’s
disease reduces the healthspan of patients, resulting in a loss of independence and social relationships. The
disease is also financially burdensome to patients and society. Despite the increase in the prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease, the mechanisms that underlie aberrant memory function are unclear, making the
treatment of memory decline challenging. It is well established that the CREB transcription factor is required for
long-term memory; however, not all factors involved in CREB-dependent long-term memory formation are
known yet. Identifying factors upstream and downstream in the CREB cascade could reveal new mechanisms
for the treatment and reversal of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. To identify new candidates that
function within the CREB pathway and regulate long-term memory consolidation, this proposal will examine the
role of specific nuclear factors (Aim 1), small non-coding RNAs (Aim 2), and glial factors (Aim 3) in CREB-
dependent long-term memory. Nuclear factors regulate gene transcription, so identifying which factors
modulate memory formation is critical. Small RNAs regulate gene expression transcriptionally and post-
transcriptionally, but their function in adult neurons and, in turn memory, has not been tested. Glia have
recently been implicated in memory, but how they support memory consolidation is largely unexplored. We are
using the well-established aging model system C. elegans to determine where and how these factors function
to regulate memory with age. Our lab has shown that the memory machinery, including the CREB requirement
for long-term memory consolidation, is conserved in C. elegans and we developed behavioral assays to test
learning and short-term and long-term associative memory. C. elegans serves as a powerful system to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of memory. There are ample genetic tools available, and, with the
worm’s simple nervous system, mechanisms by which candidate genes regulate memory can be easily
probed. By using behavioral assays, tissue-specific isolation techniques, and transcriptomic approaches, these
experiments will determine where and how specific nuclear factors, small RNAs, and glial factors function
within the CREB pathway to regulate memory formation with age. This proposal examines multiple facets of
CREB-dependent long-term memory and will identify new candidates and pathways required for memory
formation. These findings could lead to better therapeutics for reversing or treating age-related cognitive
decline in cases of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s. The proposed research plan will provide
the applicant with extensive training in behavioral, molecular, and tissue-specific transcriptomic approaches to
study memory with age. The training in these techniques and the proposed individualized mentorship plan will
ensure the applicant is prepared for a career as an independent investigator, studying mechanisms of memory
and age-related cognitive decline."
10745299,"Although neuroscience has recently provided a great deal of information about how neurons represent and
encode behaviorally relevant information at the population level, the fundamental question of how individual
neurons are selected and recruited to memory coding ensembles has been difficult to address. Our group has
been at the forefront of developing experimental methods that allow high-resolution monitoring of identified
neurons, monitoring subcellular events in dendrites and axons, all of which can now be done in awake behaving
animals. We propose to use these experimental methods in combination with circuit modeling to provide a deep
understanding of how the neurons in the mouse hippocampus are recruited to neural ensembles during
contextual memory encoding. Because much is known about the excitatory and inhibitory cell types involved and
their network connections at the main CA1 output node of the rodent hippocampus, this circuit represents a
tractable target for the first major effort to elucidate the microcircuit/cellular/subcellular mechanisms of cell-
selection at a mechanistic level comparable to that achieved in the study of simple invertebrate systems. Aim 1 is
aimed at characterizing collective inhibitory dynamics in CA1 during contextual learning. Aim 2 deals with the
events that occur in cell bodies and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells during contextual leaning, including targeted
manipulation in identified inhibitory cells types and understanding the fundamental network architecture by
which cellular activity patterns conducive to memory encoding are regulated. Aim 3 deals with how the
information that is encoded during contextual learning converges onto individual CA1 pyramidal cells during
contextual learning. Finally, Aim 4 builds upon recent work indicating that CA1 pyramidal cells can be reliably
recruited to memory coding ensembles through a plasticity mechanism that requires dendritic spikes and
somatic bursting activity. We will use optogenetic means to create artificial firing fields in neurons and determine
whether these cells can encode context-related and reinforcement related signals; we will also interfere with local
circuit inhibition to determine whether cell selection through plasticity is regulated by inhibition. Throughout
the proposal we will leverage unprecedentedly close interplay between experiment and computation by using a
biophysically detailed model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit. To the extent that the model can account for
the experimental observations, we can use it to understand underlying network principles and design
interventional experiments to validate this understanding. To the extent that the model cannot explain results,
it will help point us to aspects of network function that require further elucidation. Taken together, Aims 1-4
provide a tractable path to a major breakthrough in understanding how cognitively important neural activity
dynamics are generated at the microcircuit-, cellular- and subcellular-levels."
10764226,"This R01 application responds to FOA PA-18-061: Marijuana Use In Older Adults. Baby-
boomers who began using cannabis as young people, and who have continued cannabis use
for years, are now entering later life. The FOA prioritizes new evidence about the current risk
status of life-long cannabis users in relation to the aging process, and the aging brain, including
potential risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. How prepared are they for
successful aging and a long healthspan in late life? We propose to characterize midlife reserve
status of long-term cannabis users in the Dunedin Study, a cohort of 1037 infants born in one
city in 1972-73 and studied to age 45 in 2019, with 94% retention. There have been 8 waves of
in-depth clinical cannabis-use interviews from age 13 to age 45, a unique asset for defining the
users who are the target of this FOA. Our primary group of interest are the cohort members who
have used cannabis weekly-to-daily for the past 3 decades, three-quarters of whom have met
cannabis-dependence criteria. We will test whether such long-term cannabis users do or do not
show diminished reserve capacities in midlife, including accelerated biological aging.
Accelerated aging and diminished reserve pose risk for poor quality of life, brief health span,
and early mortality. The project’s novel conceptual framework extends the logic of “protective
cognitive reserve capacities” to a range of other life domains: we will study reserve in tested
cognitive abilities, but also reserve in neural structure and connectivity assessed through
neuroimaging, physical-health reserve assessed in clinical medical examinations, epigenetic-
maintenance reserve assessed as genome-wide DNA methylation, and financial reserves
assessed through interviews, credit ratings and tax records. In addition to analyses of
continuous dimensional measures, analyses will uniquely be able to compare long-term
cannabis users against 5 informative groups: lifelong non-users, midlife recreational users,
formerly cannabis-dependent quitters, cannabis-free long-term alcohol-abusers, and cannabis-
free long-term tobacco-smokers. For many of the project’s Aims, the Dunedin Study’s
prospective repeated measures allow the rare advantage of comparing long-term users against
themselves at a younger age, before prolonged cannabis exposure. Innovations are: (1)
cannabis-use histories validly defined with 4 decades of prospective assessments, (2) our
conceptual framework of “reserve” for future aging, (3) a comprehensive portrait of participants’
reserve status on aging-relevant measures across multiple disciplines, collected in the same
individuals."
10782459,"Background: Improving access to care is a high priority within the VA. While improvements to access have
been made in recent years, gaps and inefficiencies still exist, particularly around missed clinic visits, or `no-
shows'. The VA reports that approximately 15-18% of scheduled outpatient primary care appointments are not
completed and that 9.2 million appointments were lost because of no-shows in FY2017. In preliminary work,
we demonstrated the importance of social risk factors on VA no-show rates. These findings suggest that a no-
show prediction model that incorporates patient-level factors could predict missed clinic rates and provide
clinical phenotypes (i.e. an aggregate description of a Veterns' social vulnerabilities) of Veterans at greatest
risk of no-showing. VA Video Connect (VVC) is a newly developed telemedicine application that provides video
conferencing services as a means to connect Veterans with their VA medical providers. With VVC, Veterans
can access their VA provider from any mobile or web-based device (e.g. smartphone, tablet, or computer) and
do not need to be located at a satelite clinic. Previous work supports the idea that VVC could be targeted to
those at elevated risk of no-showing clinic appointments. This CDA proposes a risk-based, targeted use of
VVC in patients with social vulnerabilities as a means of decreasing clinic no-shows.
Significance: This proposal aims to improve access to care by identifying, describing and engaging Veterans
who would most benefit from alternative methods of primary care, specifically VA Video Connect.
Innovation: This research has several innovative aspects to it. First, we will utilize machine-learning predictive
techniques to identify and describe Veterans who are at highest risk of no-showing based on their social risk.
This methodology has never been utilized in addressing no-shows. Second, we will actively engage Veterans
in a formative assessment of how to optimize the use of VVC as an alternative method to obtaining primary
care. Engaging Veterans throughout this proposal will ensure that Veterans' voices are properly integrated into
the final product. Finally, this proposal utilizes novel telemedicine technologies (i.e. VVC) as a means of
improving access for Veterans who are at high risk of missing clinic visits.
Specific Aims & Methodology: (1) Use regression tree analysis to phenotype Veterans based on their
estimated risk of no-showing clinic appointments. Hypothesis: Social risk factors are associated with no-
shows in the ambulatory VA population and certain phenotypes will have higher no-show rates compared to
others. (2) Use a sequential exploratory mixed methods design to engage phenotyped Veterans at high
risk for no-showing and assess Veteran suitability and capability of using VVC. Hypothesis: Certain
phenotypes of Veterans will be optimally served by VVC, while other phenotypes will require higher intensity
primary care programs or continued in-person care. (3) Pilot the targeted use of VVC among 50 Veterans
at-risk of no-showing primary care clinic appointments at the SFVA using a Type I hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design. We will collect formative implementation data about local adaptability,
acceptability, and fidelity. Hypothesis: VVC will be an acceptable alternative modality of primary care for both
Veterans and providers.
Next Steps: Following the effective implementation of this CDA, we will work with operational partners (Office
of Connected Care and Telehealth) and perform a multisite assessment of the focused use of VVC on
Veterans at high risk of missing clinic appointment."
10756149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) live with a life-long chronic illness that has the potential to
adversely affect quality of life and cause early mortality. They experience varied levels of physical and
cognitive disability and face complex social and emotional challenges, in part because of impaired
psychosocial development related to their disease. They report poor health-related quality of life and feel ill-
equipped to effectively cope with the impact of illness and navigate difficult health care decisions. Palliative
care offers great opportunity to strengthen quality of life and improve the medical care of patients with ACHD,
but evidence-based palliative care is not yet incorporated in ACHD care. Resilience, harnessing personal
resources to sustain physical and emotional well-being in the face of stress, is a promising target for palliative
care intervention because it promotes self-efficacy and improves quality of life. The long-term goal of this
award is to promote Dr. Steiner’s development into an independent physician scientist working to improve
palliative care for patients with ACHD. Dr. Steiner will evaluate resilience as it relates to health-related
psychosocial outcomes and adapt and test a successful resilience intervention for patients with ACHD. The
“Promoting Resilience in Stress Management” (PRISM) intervention has demonstrated efficacy in improving
quality of life and alleviating psychological distress among adolescents and young adults with cancer and has
been successfully adapted for patients with other chronic illnesses and their parents. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
Dr. Steiner will conduct a prospective cohort study to determine the association between resilience and specific
patient-centered psychosocial outcomes, namely quality of life and psychological distress, in patients with
ACHD. In Aim 2, she will use semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand patients’ knowledge of and
perspectives regarding resilience. She will assess the acceptability of PRISM and identify ways to refine its
content for this patient population. Aims 1 and 2 will inform Aim 3, in which she will conduct a pilot randomized
trial to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the PRISM intervention to enhance resilience in
patients with ACHD. To support her career development, Dr. Steiner proposes an integrated curriculum with
the following learning objectives: 1) research in psychological function and behavioral interventions, 2)
advanced qualitative research methods, 3) clinical trial design, implementation, and statistical analysis, and 4)
grant and manuscript preparation. The proposed project activities will take place within the robust intellectual
environment offered by the University of Washington, an institution with a strong commitment to the
development of investigators’ academic research careers, and she will have available the vast resources of the
Division of Cardiology and the Cambia Center for Palliative Care Excellence. In this rapidly-growing population
of patients with ACHD, identifying ways to maximize quality of life and incorporate palliative care is essential
and will ultimately encourage healthcare engagement and enhance patient care."
10760306,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our research program combines detailed biochemical reconstitution experiments with powerful cell-based
assays, with a goal of gaining fundamental mechanistic insights about RNA polymerase II (pol II) function and
its regulation. The 12-subunit human pol II enzyme transcribes all protein-coding and many non-coding RNAs
in the human genome. Pol II transcription initiation is regulated by the 4.0 MDa Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC),
which contains TFIIA, IIB, IID, IIE, IIF, IIH, pol II, and Mediator. Together with sequence-specific, DNA-binding
transcription factors (TFs), the PIC helps direct the timing, location, and direction of pol II transcription, genome-
wide. How TFs and the PIC work together during different stages of pol II transcription (e.g. initiation, pausing,
elongation) remain incompletely understood; moreover, new insights over the past 5+ years have transformed
our understanding of transcription. For instance, enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and enhancer-promoter
communication appear to drive lineage- or signal-specific (or oncogenic) gene expression programs, and liquid
phase separated molecular condensates correlate with pol II activity in cells. Although new mechanistic models
have emerged, such models cannot be reliably tested using only cell-based methods, in part because of the
enormous complexity of cellular systems. For instance, the identity and concentration of the proteins, nucleic
acids, and biochemicals that are present at any given gene in a population of cells cannot possibly be defined.
 In the next 5 years, we propose to leverage our unique expertise in biochemical reconstitution with cutting-
edge cellular methods to address the following high-impact areas: 1) Liquid phase-separated molecular
condensates and pol II function. We seek to define how (or whether) molecular condensates regulate
transcription, including whether distinct compositions help control different stages of pol II transcription (e.g.
initiation vs. elongation). 2) Regulation of pol II initiation, pausing, and elongation by the transcriptional kinases
CDK7 (TFIIH subunit), CDK8 (Mediator-associated kinase), and CDK9 (P-TEFb kinase). We will assess what
each kinase, alone and in combination with the others, contributes to the regulation of pol II activity. This will
include potential “downstream” impacts on elongation rates or RNA processing. 3) Enhancer RNA (eRNA)
transcription and super-enhancer function. We will dissect the mechanistic requirements for bidirectional eRNA
transcription, to determine whether they are distinct from typical protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we seek to
reconstitute super-enhancer function in vitro, which would serve as a framework for understanding the “rules” by
which super-enhancers drive high-level transcription in human cells. (Although this aspect is ambitious, we note
our recent success with reconstitution of pol II promoter-proximal pausing, which the field long considered difficult
if not impossible.) Finally, we emphasize that an equally important aspect of our research plan is to rigorously
test the models that emerge from our detailed and systematic in vitro assays through targeted, follow-up cell-
based assays, which will implement genome-editing, chemical biology, transcriptomics, and other approaches."
10757034,"Our long-term goal is to enable diabetes treatments through precise control of pancreatic nerve activity. We will create a detailed and systemic view of defined pancreatic nerves, their gene expression profiles, function and the effects of high fat diet (HFD) that are necessary to achieve this. Our pilot data already suggest HFD causes rapid disruption of pancreatic nerve structure and their ability to control insulin release in response to blood glucose. Our proposal will create new insights into pancreatic nerves' control of blood glucose by bringing an unprecedented level of precision and specificity by combining 3d imaging, RNAseq and neuromodulation tools in which we have unique and deep experience. Without this knowledge, the likelihood of successfully targeting neural pathways to control blood glucose in diabetes will remain remote. The overall objective of this proposal, which is the next step toward attaining new avenues to treat diabetes, is to understand the effects of HFD on the structure, transcriptome and function of pancreatic parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent nerves. Our central hypothesis is that HFD increases islet sympathetic innervation and reduces islet parasympathetic innervation leading to insufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that pancreatic islets are highly innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and HFD disrupts pancreatic nerve structure, gene expression and function. However, we do not know if the structural changes from HFD are uniform, which endocrine cells are affected or the time course. We do not have a comprehensive gene expression profile of neurons innervating the pancreas or the molecular pathways disrupted by HFD. In addition, we do not know the precise functions of pancreatic parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves or how HFD affects these roles. These represent major gaps in our understanding. To test our central hypothesis and attain the overall objective, we will a) determine the effects of HFD on the 3D structure of islet sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent nerves, b) determine the effects of HFD on gene expression in pancreatic sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent nerves b) determine the effects of HFD on the function of islet sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to regulate islet hormone release. To do so, we will use 3D imaging of cleared pancreata to determine the effects of low (10%) or HFD (45%) on pancreatic parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve structure and their relationship with beta, alpha and delta cells in fed and fasted mice. We will use single cell RNAseq to identify the effects of HFD on gene expression and the molecular pathways disrupted by HFD in pancreatic parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. We will use highly target neuromodulation to determine the effects of HFD on pancreatic sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve function. The proposed studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the unique biology of pancreatic sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to form a crucial foundation for future studies identifying critical periods, reversibility and therapeutic targets to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes."

This NIH ORIP K01 award application describes a 5-year training plan designed to allow me to gain additional
skill and knowledge so that I can transition to an independent R01-funded tenure track research scientist. In
carrying out the proposed research and career development plan, I will add to my scientific repertoire and acquire
expertise in intestinal stem cell biology, microbiome, and microfluidic organ-on-chip technology. Using this newly
acquired expertise, I will establish a scientific niche that will set me apart from my mentors and pave the way to
a robust, extramurally funded research program. With the support of my mentoring team, I have designed a
robust research program that leverages my extensive expertise with comparative gastroenterology and
molecular biology. Specifically, Aim 1 will demonstrate molecular and genetic alterations affecting canine IBD
following the development and validation of a patient-specific IBD model that can quantitatively assess the
cellular and molecular signature of host-microbiome crosstalk. Aim 2. will allow mapping of the microbial
signature and epithelial integrity in response to the host-microbiome intercellular crosstalk by utilizing single-cell
level multi-omics (especially genomics and transcriptomics) and RNA in situ hybridization. Consistent with the
ORIP’s mission statements promoting veterinary scientists to employ their expertise in comparative medicine to
investigate human diseases, my research will allow me to use my expertise in comparative gastroenterology as
well as in primary stem cell culture to investigate alterations in intestinal homeostasis relevant to Inflammatory
Bowel Disease. Also, as ORIP supports animal modeling of human diseases, I will be using the dog as a
spontaneous animal model to investigate the effect of gut microbiota in the intestinal epithelium given their
genetic and physiological similarity to humans. The results generated in this proposal have direct implications
for human diseases, since they will provide new insights into genetic and transcriptomic alterations initiating or
maintaining the chronic inflammation in the gut. Such findings can be applied to various chronic conditions that
have been epidemiologically associated with microbiome dysbiosis and disturbances of intestinal health (i.e.,
Colorectal Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Alzheimer’s Disease, to name a few). This knowledge may be applied
to understand disease development and novel therapies aimed at modifying intestinal homeostasis via
perturbation of epithelium-microbiome-immune axis in the intestine. In summary, the training goals and career
development activities proposed in this application will promote my successful transition into independent
research directions."

There is a lack of fundamental understanding on how microbial breakdown of chlorinated
organic compounds is influenced by the presence of sorptive surfaces. Several laboratory and
field studies have demonstrated a synergy between sorptive materials and microorganisms
leading to the development of material aided delivery of bioamendments in both groundwater
and sediment applications. However, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between
sorptive surfaces and microbial dechlorination is lacking. To fill this critical knowledge gap, this
research team of chemical/environmental engineers and microbiologists will investigate the
fundamental mechanism of microbial dechlorination of chlorinated organics on sorptive surfaces
and develop quantitative models that allow optimization and engineering scaleup of enhanced
bioremediation aided by materials engineering. Improved understanding will allow better
prediction of the degradation of sorbed chemicals in the environment and enable optimization of
material science aided technologies for the delivery of biodegradation technologies.
The project will target chlorinated organics ranging from less hydrophobic compounds like
chloroethenes typically associated with groundwater and strongly hydrophobic compounds such
as PCBs typically associated with sediments. These pollutants will be investigated individually
as well as in mixtures that are commonly encountered at Superfund sites. A set of carbon-based
sorbent materials will be produced in the laboratory to provide a range of physical and chemical
properties. In addition to the lab synthesized materials, two most commonly used activated
carbons (bituminous coal based, and coconut shell based) and graphite will be tested in parallel
for comparison. Through systematic laboratory experiments, the physical and chemical
properties (such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, electron accepting capacity, and
carbon content) will be evaluated for influence on the sorption characteristics and synergy with
biodegradation of chloroethenes and PCBs. Final material selection will also be guided by
environmental sustainability considerations. Sorption and biokinetics data from the experimental
studies with optimized materials will be synthesized into advanced site models to predict
material behavior for field-scale remedial applications. Results from the modeling simulations
will allow for optimization of the engineering design for pilot and full-scale applications at
contaminated groundwater and sediment Superfund sites. This platform of combining tailored
materials with biodegradation will be adaptable for targeting other pollutant mixtures."
10754557,"Macro-autophagy is the intracellular stress-response pathway by which the cell packages portions of
the cytosol for delivery into the lysosome. This “packaging” is carried out by the de novo formation of
a new organelle called the autophagosome that grows and encapsulates cytosolic material for eventual
lysosomal degradation. How autophagosomes form, including especially how the membrane
coordinates the capture of cytosolic toxins with its own expansion and closure is an area of intense
study. One factor implicated in both cargo-capture and autophagosome dynamics is the ubiquitin-like
protein, Atg8. During autophagy, Atg8 becomes covalently bound to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
on the preautophagosomal membrane and remains bound through the maturation process of the
autophagosome.
Our preliminary results suggest that Atg8-PE decorates the earliest autophagosome membrane
progenitor structure and plays an integral role in organizing the accumulation of membranes that
presages the eventual growth of the autophagosome itself. These activities depend upon the ability of
Atg8-PE to tether individual vesicles into an underlying support. Critically, Atg8 must remain associated
with the membranes throughout the growth of the autophagosome. Our results now also describe how
this pool of Atg8-PE is protected from recycling proteases that otherwise function to constitutively
remove Atg8 at other sites. Our discoveries are made possible by two important technological
advances. First, we have developed a variety of in vitro reconstitution approaches to study how Atg8-
PE and other autophagy proteins influence membrane deformation and structure. Second, we are now
able to image autophagosome intermediate structures at super resolution in three dimensions and
identify the same structures in micron deep electron tomograms revealing key features of the earliest
Atg8-decorated membranes.
With this proposal, we expect to demonstrate exactly how Atg8-PE proteins organize the proteins and
membranes that support autophagosome membrane expansion."

Silent cerebral infarction is a serious consequence of sickle cell disease (SCD), affecting ~40% of patients by
age 15. Although these injuries accumulate occultly, they are linked with cognitive deficits, diminished school
performance, and increased risk of overt stroke. Our long-term goal is to develop a low-cost brain monitoring
tool that can screen for silent infarct risk in pediatric SCD to facilitate timely therapeutic intervention and that can
optimize these interventions to mitigate adverse events. Silent infarcts in SCD are thought to arise from anemia-
induced microvascular perfusion abnormalities and subsequent reduced cerebrovascular reserve that is
insufficient to meet tissue metabolic demands. Thus, quantification of abnormalities in microvascular cerebral
blood flow, vascular reactivity, and/or oxygen extraction may be useful in identifying infarct risk. Indeed, recent
MRI studies have shown that SCD children with silent infarcts have globally elevated oxygen extraction in both
white and grey matter compared to those without infarct. However, current modalities that quantify microvascular
hemodynamic parameters (e.g., PET, MRI) are prohibitively expensive, have limited availability, and require
anesthesia in children <6y, making them inappropriate as routine screening tools. Transcranial Doppler
ultrasound measures of macrovascular blood flow velocity have had great success in reducing the risk of overt
strokes of the macrovasculature by <80%; however, ultrasound is not sensitive to silent microvascular infarcts.
Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for a low-cost, non-invasive tool sensitive to microvascular, tissue-level
cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities in pediatric SCD to detect children at risk for silent infarcts.
 Diffuse optical spectroscopies (namely frequency domain near-infrared spectroscopy combined with diffuse
correlation spectroscopy, FDNIRS/DCS) may provide a user-friendly, cost-effective alternative to current
technologies. These non-invasive techniques use near-infrared light to relate measured changes in light intensity
detected at the tissue surface to hemodynamic properties of the underlying tissue. Combined, FDNIRS/DCS
enable assessment of oxygen extraction, an index of cerebral blood flow, and an index of cerebral oxygen
metabolism. Further, using a simple breath hold challenge, FDNIRS/DCS can assess cerebrovascular reactivity,
the vasculature’s ability to dilate in response to carbon dioxide. Our preliminary results show that FDNIRS/DCS
can detect expected trends in brain oxygen extraction and blood flow in SCD patients (i.e., elevated compared
to controls, inverse correlation with hemoglobin). Moreover, we have developed new analytical strategies that
improve the accuracy of the DCS-measured blood flow index by accounting for the influence of hematocrit.
Building on this preliminary data, the overall objective of this proposal is to validate our DCS hematocrit-
correction against “gold-standard” perfusion MRI, to determine if FDNIRS/DCS is sensitive to cerebral
hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with silent infarcts, and to demonstrate FDNIRS/DCS can assess real-
time changes in cerebral hemodynamics during transfusion, which reduces silent infarct risk in SCD patients."

Congestive heart failure is one of the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and the World.
However, despite the major advancements in research and therapeutic developments, there has been no
improvement in death rates over the years. This necessitates reinvestigating the basic mechanisms that govern
the progression heart failure. Adaptation of gene expression is the earliest fundamental response during
overload. We have shown the widespread regulatory influence of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (pol II)
pausing on gene transcription in heart. However, the underlying mechanisms that control and synchronize the
release of paused pol II for active transcription are unclear and conflicting, and its contribution to development
of cardiac hypertrophy and failure still unknown. Negative elongation factors (Nelf), comprising of five subunits
(NelfA to NelfE) has been implicated in pol II pausing, with NelfA subunit identified as an essential component
for pausing. Our preliminary data shows increase in NelfA expression with cardiac hypertrophy, which is required
for compensatory increase in gene expression in these hearts. Conversely, NelfA levels decline in failing hearts,
suggesting downregulation of NelfA could be contributing to decompensation and progression of failure. Our
genome-wide sequencing data shows widespread NelfA occupancy on active promoters including inducible and
constitutively expressed essential genes. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of chromatin bound NelfA shows
association with chromatin remodelers and pre-mRNA processing proteins. In this study, we investigate the role
of NelfA in pol II dynamics, chromatin remodeling and gene expression, and its impact on progression of heart
failure. We have hypothesized that adaptation of gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy is achieved by
phosphorylation dependent increase in the rate of clearance of paused pol II from essential gene promoters, and
de novo recruitment of NelfA and assembly of paused complex at inducible promoters. Loss of NelfA results in
disrupted paused complex, altered chromatin remodeling, inefficient transcript processing and inhibited gene
expression that precipitates heart failure. We have proposed two robust specific aims to test our hypothesis – 1.
To examine the mechanisms regulating NelfA -dependent pol II pausing in gene transcription during cardiac
hypertrophy. 2. To investigate the effects of loss of NelfA on gene expression and progression of heart failure in
conditional NelfA-KO model subjected to pressure overload."
10745911,"This proposal outlines a comprehensive 5-year training program to develop Jared Kushner, MD, into an
independent translational investigator. Dr. Kushner is a general cardiologist and physician-scientist whose
ultimate goal is to improve care for patients with heart disease. To reach this goal, he is interested in
understanding how abnormal ion channel function in the heart can lead to cardiovascular disease and
conversely, how cardiovascular disease can cause maladaptive changes in ion channel regulation. In order to
become an independent translational scientist and leader in this field, Dr. Kushner has developed a career
development plan designed to fill specific educational and experiential gaps in his training. These short-term
goals include: 1) Receiving advanced training in cellular electrophysiology, with an emphasis on techniques
that probe ion channel function in their native milieu; 2) Acquiring experience in the analysis of large datasets,
with the goal of interpreting large-scale changes in gene and protein expression; 3) Developing expertise in
proteomics and the use of mass spectrometry; 4) Refining his current skills and developing new skills in
cardiovascular physiology, with emphasis on the experimental assessment of load-independent measures of
systolic and diastolic function; 5) Acquiring expertise in probing pathways of protein degradation, with
emphasis on the destruction of ion channels in health and disease; and 5) Developing skills critical to his long-
term success, with particular emphasis on his grant-writing skills. Columbia University, with its rich and
supportive research environment, proved to be an ideal setting for Dr. Kushner to organize a multi-disciplinary
mentorship team with the expertise to accomplish these goals.
 In his proposed research project, Dr. Kushner will use results from proximity-labeling the interactome of the
L-type Ca2+ channel, CaV1.2, to gain insights into regulators of the channel essential to its function in normal
biology and in heart failure (HF), a condition characterized by reduced systolic function and adrenergic reserve,
often experienced by patients as increased shortness of breath with exertion. Using transgenic mice with
cardiac-specific expression of CaV1.2 subunits fused to the engineered ascorbate peroxidase, APEX2, he
probed the changing channel microenvironment in hearts of mice that developed chronic HF. He identified
significant changes in 71 of over 2000 proteins in the vicinity of CaV1.2 in HF. To determine if those proteins
perturb CaV1.2 function, he will analyze channel activity, contractility, and adrenergic responsiveness in genetic
knockouts of APEX-identified proteins. To measure effects on CaV1.2 expression, he will use a transgenic
mouse expressing a YFP-tagged α1C containing a bungarotoxin-binding site on an extracellular loop (BBS-
α1C). Treating isolated myocytes with fluorophore-conjugated bungarotoxin, he can track total and surface
expression of CaV1.2 with flow-cytometry. Generating HF in BBS-α1C mice crossed with knockouts of APEX-
identified proteins in HF, he can identify those neighboring proteins that alter CaV1.2 expression of HF."

Determining how neurons are correctly specified and assembled into functional circuits will provide
insight into developmental disorders of the nervous system and may suggest therapeutic approaches to
promote nerve regeneration. Slit and Netrin, and their Robo and Fra/DCC receptors, are evolutionary
conserved families of signaling molecules that play important roles in regulating neuronal development;
however, the understanding of how these receptors are regulated and how they signal to direct axon
growth and guidance is incomplete. These are important questions because perturbations of these
signaling pathways are implicated in diseases of nervous system development. Slits, Netrins and their
receptors also play essential roles outside of the nervous system and disruptions of these pathways are
associated with several kinds of cancer. Our research program focuses on three broad areas related to
the roles and regulation of these molecules in neuronal development using the genetically tractable
Drosophila embryonic nervous system as a model. First, we are working to define functional and
molecular links between conserved transcriptional regulators that impart neuronal subtype identity and
the Robo and Fra/DCC receptors that coordinate axon guidance and dendrite morphogenesis in
response to Slit and Netrin. Here, we will use genetic and molecular screening approaches, including
Fluorescence Activated Cell sorting (FACs) of defined subsets of motor neurons, together with
transcript profiling in wild type and mutant backgrounds, to systematically identify additional effectors of
these transcriptional programs. Second, we are characterizing a newly discovered mechanism through
which the Frazzled/DCC receptor intracellular domain (ICD) itself can act in the nucleus as a
transcriptional activator to regulate commissureless expression to ensure that commissural axons avoid
premature responses to midline repellent Slit. Here, we will use genetic and molecular approaches to
identify factors that cooperate with the Fra ICD to regulate transcription and transcript profiling methods
to identify additional targets of the Fra ICD. In addition, we will explore whether signaling from the
nucleus is a common property of axon guidance receptors and through collaboration we will test if this
is a conserved property of guidance receptors. Third, we are determining the molecular mechanisms
underlying Robo and Fra/DCC receptor signaling during axon guidance using molecular, genetic,
biochemical and cell biological approaches. Specifically, we use in vivo genetic manipulation, together
with fluorescently tagged receptors and reporters of signaling molecule activity in vitro, to define the cell
biological outputs of receptor activation with sub-cellular resolution. Our research program will define
new concepts in the molecular biology of axon guidance, inform studies of related proteins in
mammalian systems and will likely enhance our understanding of neural developmental disorders."
10761731,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 We aim to reduce the limb-threatening and life-limiting burden of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFU)
by advancing science in its most critical component: protective pressure offloading. We intend to do this via a
randomized comparative effectiveness study of a first-ever smart removable offloading device (MOTUS
Smart), which enables objective monitoring of adherence as well as adherence reinforcement (real-time
notification of poor adherence via smartwatch + feedback via smartphone).
 Prescribed offloading, such as a removable cast walker (RCW), is used to reduce pressure on the bottom of
the foot to protect the DFU. This allows it to heal while allowing the patient to be mobile. These devices can be
a key component of healing and prevention of DFU. Unfortunately, patient adherence with these devices is
poor. While irremovable offloading devices could address this challenge, they have other limitations including
poor acceptability (because of its irremovability during sleep and shower), poor scalability (e.g., only 2% of
U.S. clinics regularly prescribe this gold-standard therapy), poor patient-centered outcomes (e.g., poor
sleep quality), and high likelihood of deconditioning (frailty/leg muscle atrophy) induced by offloading because
of prolonged ankle joint immobilization leading to high recurrence rate of DFU. Another scientific gap in the
field is poor understanding of the influence of weight-bearing activity on plantar wound healing. Some report
that regular weight-bearing activity even while wearing protected offloading may delay healing. Others suggest
that stable and appropriately dosed protected weight-bearing exercise is beneficial to accelerate healing.
 Given the debilitating nature of DFU and the high cost of treatment, there is a need for novel
technological approaches to motivate neuropathic patients without normal painful feedback to adhere
to prescribed offloading and to enable clinicians to monitor and counsel patients on physical activity
and adherence. In this study, we will enroll 216 ambulatory patients with active DFU randomized to three
groups (ratio: n=1:1:1). The first group includes the gold-standard treatment, an irremovable boot (which forces
patients into adhering to protective offloading of pressure). The second group includes an otherwise identically
equipped traditional removable device along with traditional counseling regarding the importance of adherence
to offloading. The third group will include a “smart” removable cast walker that includes adherence
reinforcement and remote patient monitoring. All three groups’ devices will be embedded with sensors that will
allow monitoring of adherence and activity. This study enables us to examine the benefit of adherence
reinforcement to speed up wound healing (Aim 1); the association between dosage of physical activity
and wound healing (Aim 2); and patient-centered outcomes between the three treatment arms (Aim 3)."

 Pathogenic protein aggregates are a hallmark neuropathologic finding in many
neurodegenerative diseases. Most research has thus far focused on how these pathogenic
aggregates are formed. However, little is known about the mechanism by which aggregates
spread from cell to cell, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease progression. Parkinson's
disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the gene
glucosidase beta acid 1 (GBA), which encodes a lysosomal enzyme producing ceramide, are the
strongest genetic risk factor for PD. Recently, GBA mutations were also found to associate with
accelerated cognitive and motor symptom progression, suggesting that GBA mutations influence
the spread of protein aggregates within the brain. Recent work in PD and other neurodegenerative
diseases suggest that dysregulation of lipid metabolism, and in particular ceramide, also has an
important role in pathogenesis. Our recent work revealed a novel function for GBA in regulating
extracellular vesicle (EVs) formation and cargo. I hypothesize that GBA deficiency mediates faster
propagation of protein aggregates from cell to cell through dysregulation of EVs. To investigate
the mechanisms by which GBA mutations influence the propagation of protein aggregates
between tissues and between cells, I will use Drosophila, mouse and human neuronal cell culture
models of GBA deficiency. I hypothesize that decreased ceramide levels due to GBA deficiency
lead to dysregulation of EVs, which promotes the transfer of protein aggregates from cell to cell
and leads to faster progression of neurodegeneration. Understanding the mechanisms underlying
the prion-like propagation of protein aggregates has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic
targets that could slow or halt PD and other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the
spread of pathogenic protein aggregation."
10782446,"The advent of clinically approved imaging at 7 Tesla (7T) has been met with high expectations. The potential
benefits of increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), new contrasts and unprecedented resolution promise to extend
what once was a tool for biomedical research into an imaging device defining state of the art patient care. The
benefit of obtaining FDA approval is that it creates the opportunity for clinicians to investigate its true potential
and to discover the applications where it uniquely impacts patient care. The current FDA approval however is
only for head and knee applications, and even then, the MRI scanner is limited to using only a fraction of its
installed functionality. Parallel transmit (pTx), a functionality that can tackle some of the biggest challenges facing
ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI, has not been sufficiently developed, integrated and validated to safely use in the
clinical setting. These challenges such as non-uniform transmit fields and issues with local heating scale with
the size of the object being imaged. While imaging the head and knee can manage without this functionality, pTx
it is an absolute necessity for applications in the human torso. While 7T has shown great potential at imaging
targets in the torso in the research setting, there is the critical question of how to expand upon these promising
results. We believe that several enabling technologies need to be further developed and integrated prior to
obtaining FDA approval. These developments are addressed in three technical aims. The first is the development
and optimization of radiofrequency (RF) coils to efficiently transmit RF energy into and receive signals from the
body in order to realize the promised gains in SNR compared to lower field strengths. The second is the
construction of a virtual database of human body models and strategies for overcoming the current limitations of
assuming overly restrictive safety factors when attempting to use the pTx system. The third involves integrating
pTx functionality into an extended multi-parametric prostate imaging protocol and motion compensation
strategies through sequence tailored pTx solutions and optimization. A final translational aim will use the prostate
as a testbed to explore the RF coils and pTx enabled sequences in a patient study comparing cancer detection
and imaging metrics with the same patients imaged at 3T. Upon successful completion of these developmental
and translational aims, we will have overcome the barriers to enabling clinical torso imaging at UHF and verified
its effective use in a clinical setting. The outcomes of this project will be critical component in expanding the FDA

10745696,"Cerebral cortical development is a highly orchestrated process, with production of neurons destined for the cortical layers produced in order, deep to superficial, followed by glial generation. The timing of this process is very different between species. For example, mouse corticogenesis occurs over approximately a week of gestation, while in humans the process takes several months, resulting in a much larger and more complex cortex. Lineage studies have functionally defined the major types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to corticogenesis, including stem cell-like radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). However, much remains to be discovered regarding how RGCs and IPCs are specified over time. We have discovered that during asymmetric RGC-IPC cell divisions, the RNA binding protein Stau2 segregates a complex cargo of coding and non-coding RNA specifically into the IPC daughter. Analysis of this cargo at different embryonic stages by RNA-sequencing has revealed networks of genes that are candidates for controlling proliferation and temporal specification of the IPC fate. Here we propose to test these candidates in functional studies, using high-throughput automated time-lapse image analysis for in vitro studies, as well as a novel lentiviral in vivo screening method, to define their roles in specifying IPCs and timing corticogenesis. In contrast to the progress made in understanding the characteristics of mouse cortical progenitor cells, less is understood regarding human cortical progenitors. Fundamental knowledge about how human RGCs and IPCs produce diverse progeny over time, their division mode, cell cycle times and lineages, remains unknown. Here we will address these gaps in knowledge using long-term time-lapse lineage analysis in vitro. In addition, by identifying genes expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, including at the single cell level and via analysis of the Stau2 cargo, we will reveal human cortical progenitor subtypes and heterogeneity. Further, a comparison of human and mouse cortical progenitor cell data will help illuminate key differences to address a major mystery: the difference in timing of mouse and human cortical development. Our lab continues to explore the interaction of environmental factors on cortical progenitor cells, aided by the ability to rapidly quantify changes in proliferation, division mode and differentiation using time-lapse analysis. Soluble factors released by structures in the germinal niche such as vascular endothelial cells and the choroid plexus, act on cortical progenitors to regulate the numbers and types of progeny they produce. Our recent work has identified a panel of candidate niche molecules secreted by the choroid plexus that could interact with receptors expressed on neural progenitors, which we propose to examine in vitro and in vivo, in mouse and human. Defining niche factors and their specific actions paves the way to address diseases that involve degeneration of stem cell zones which are normally active throughout life. Furthermore, defining environmental factors that act on human NPCs is important for translation towards regenerative therapy development."
10741808,"MASSI/ BOSCO – ABSTRACT
Profilin-1 (PFN1) is a 15kDa actin-binding protein that plays a critical role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics.
In order to promote actin polymerization in cells, PFN1-bound actin must bind and synergize with formin
proteins. In 2012, we identified mutations in PFN1 that cause the uniformly lethal neurodegenerative disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Defects in cytoskeletal dynamics and
trafficking were already implicated in ALS pathogenesis, however the mechanism(s) by which ALS-linked
proteins disrupt these processes is poorly understood. Many in the field predicted that ALS-linked mutations in
PFN1 would abrogate the binding of PFN1 to other cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and/or members of the
formin family of proteins. However, rather unexpectedly, our extensive preliminary data show the opposite.
ALS-linked PFN1 (ALS-PFN1) exhibits enhanced binding affinity for select formin proteins in cells and in vitro.
Further, ALS-PFN1 causes formins to become hyperactivated, leading to accelerated and greater actin
polymerization in cells. Our previous biochemical analyses demonstrated that ALS-PFN1 variants are severely
destabilized and prone to aggregate. However, the overall three-dimensional x-ray structures of PFN1 mutants
are very similar to WT PFN1. Therefore, we hypothesize that altered protein dynamics caused by ALS-
mutations account for our observed phenotypes with respect to formin binding, actin polymerization
and PFN1 aggregation. To test this hypothesis, Drs. Francesca Massi and Daryl Bosco have formed a multi-
disciplinary, collaborative project that combines molecular dynamics (MD), NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy
and cell biology to study the interactions of PFN1 with both formins and actin at atomistic resolution. Indeed,
our novel preliminary MD simulations indicate that ALS-linked mutations perturb a network of residues within
PFN1 that contact both actin and formin. Further, our extensive preliminary NMR data reveal PFN1 residues
near the formin-binding interface are affected by actin binding, and that ALS-linked mutations perturb the
intrinsic dynamics of PFN1. Collectively, our preliminary data provide a strong premise that altered protein
dynamics of ALS-PFN1 contributes to dysregulated actin polymerization and protein aggregation, which are
both involved in ALS pathogenesis. Our proposal builds upon our exciting preliminary data to rigorously
characterize the dynamics and mechanism(s) of binding between PFN1, actin and formin. These approaches
are highly innovative in the context of studying actin dynamics, and are ideal for probing the actin-PFN1-formin
ternary complex, for which little is known at atomistic resolution. These studies are expected to have a
significant and broad impact on neurodegenerative disease research, as well as on our fundamental
understanding of actin dynamics."
10757037,"Obesity is a major co-morbidity factor in diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and other
diseases. Recently, a new group of human genes was linked to obesity, the genes encoding the R7 family
of regulator of G protein signaling proteins (RGS6, 7, 9 and 11) and Gnb5, which encodes the atypical G
protein beta subunit Gb5. This proposal studies how a deficiency in the Gnb5 and R7 genes can lead to
obesity and other abnormalities in control of body weight. The ultimate goal is to discover effective
treatments of disorders associated with neuroendocrine pathways regulated by these genes.
 The proposed research plan builds upon earlier discoveries that together constitute a strong
premise for this study. Gb5 and R7 proteins form obligatory dimers, so that the Gnb5 knockout causes
complete degradation of the entire Gb5-R7 complex. Ablation of one Gnb5 allele leads to obesity and
metabolic syndrome in mice; this finding was later confirmed by human genetics. Subsequent mechanistic
investigations in this lab identified a novel role for the Gb5-R7 complex in pancreatic beta cells where Gb5-
R7 strongly promoted secretion of insulin. Brain is the main organ regulating body weight, and the
expression level of Gb5-R7 is much higher in the CNS than in the pancreas or any other peripheral tissues.
These considerations lead us to the hypothesis that Gb5-RGS7 regulates body weight via its function in
the neurons, where, similarly to the insulin-secreting beta cells, it controls secretion of neurotransmitters
and hormones. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies in the lab demonstrated that local knockout of
Gnb5 in the adult mouse hypothalamus dramatically increased body and adiposity. The proposed
experiments will develop this discovery through a series of experiments performed at the organismal,
tissue and cellular levels. Specific Aim 1 will use the Cre-loxP approach to inactivate Gnb5 in specific
hypothalamic nuclei and types of neurons and examine the effect of the knockout on body weight and
metabolism. Overexpression of Gnb5 using viral gene transfer will be performed to rescue the changes
caused by the knockout. Aim 2 will study co-expression of Gnb5 with GPCRs and gene encoding
hypothalamic hormones and tissue slices will be examined ex vivo for signal-stimulated secretion of
specific hormones. Specific Aim 3 will study Gb5-R7 its knockout (CRISPR/Cas9), knockdown and
overexpression in cell lines that endogenously express Gb5-R7. Experiments will utilize pharmacological
agents and structure-function analysis to interrogate molecular events in signaling and secretory pathways.
The proposed investigation of the Gb5-R7 complex will elucidate the novel mechanism regulating secretion
of hypothalamic hormones and significantly advance our understanding of G protein signaling, etiology of
obesity and other metabolic and neuroendocrine disorders."
10767262,"Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major healthcare and social-economic burden. With
effective treatment yet to be developed, the early detection at the prodromal stage and surveillance of the
progression are the best approach to control and intervene AD development. While non-invasive positron
emission tomography (PET) can measure amyloid-β peptides (Aβs) and microtubule tau proteins in the brain to
confirm the onset of AD, the availability of imaging equipment, diagnostic accuracy of single Aβ or tau specific
radiotracer and the cost and exposure of radioactive materials limit imaging applications from early screening
of large and diverse populations and repeated scans in monitoring disease progression. Therefore, there is an
unmet need in developing robust, accessible and cost-effective in vitro diagnostic tools for detecting and
measuring the levels of Aβs and tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid or even blood samples of patients or at-risk
individuals at the “point-of-care”. However, serum detection of these AD biomarker demands high sensitivity
because of low concentrations of Aβs or tau proteins in blood samples and slow and gradual change of the
levels of these biomarkers during disease progression. One major challenge to the current biospecimen based
in vitro diagnostics is the biofouling effect, i.e., adsorption of proteins and biomolecules on the surface of the
detecting agents and devices. This leads to the formation of the layer of unwanted molecules, which reduces
the detection specificity and sensitivity by (1) blocking antibodies to the targeted biomarkers, and (2) causing
high “background noise” from adsorbed non-specific proteins and other molecules interfering the detection of
targeted biomarkers. We believe that these problems can be overcome by our innovative solutions, i.e., 1) the
anti-biofouling polymer to coat nanoparticle capturing agents to block the non-specific protein adsorption, thus
protecting the sensitivity and specificity of the targeting ligands/antibodies; 2) high magnetism magnetic iron
oxide nanorods (IONRs) with nano-sized magnetic stir bar action to enhance mixing of capturing agents and
targeted biomarkers in the microfluidic detection system. By integrating these technologies, our project aims to
develop a multiplexing based “liquid biopsy” system with ultra-high sensitivity and specificity for serum
detection of selected AD biomarkers, Aβ40, Aβ42, total-tau (tTau), phosphorylated-Tau (pTau)181 and amyloid
precursor protein (APP) in one sample. We will make and optimize antibody-conjugated anti-biofouling IONRs
with different aspect ratios for highly efficient fluid mixing and multiplex detection of spiked Aβ40, Aβ42, tTau
and pTau proteins and APP669-711 in blood samples (Aim 1), coupled with developing a microfluidic device with
effective nano-stir bar mixing for improved detection efficiency (Aim 2), and then evaluate and validate the
developed “liquid biopsy” system by multiplexed measuring serum Aβ40, Aβ42, tTau, pTau proteins and
APP669-711 levels in AD patients longitudinally, and comparing and correlating the serum measurement with
results from Aβ and tau PET imaging and proteomics analysis done on the same patients (Aim 3)."
10754893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will test the hypothesis that SOX transcription factors (TFs) modulate the genomic
specificity of Wnt/Beta-catenin (BCAT) mediated transcription in early gut development and determine
the underlying molecular mechanisms. Wnt signaling regulates gene expression in digestive system
development, homeostasis and disease, where it is an important therapeutic target. While the core Wnt
transcriptional machinery is well studied, how cell-specific target genes are selected remains one of the most
important unresolved issues in the field. Current dogma is that canonical Wnt stabilizes cytoplasmic BCAT, which
translocates to the nucleus and interacts with one of four TCF/LEF HMG-box TFs to stimulate transcription.
However, all TCFs bind to nearly identical consensus sites indicating they alone cannot account for the diversity
of transcriptional responses. Using the complementary advantages of Xenopus embryos and differentiating
human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), we have accumulated compelling evidence that SOX HMG-box TFs
modulate the genomic specificity of Wnt/BCAT-mediated transcription during early gut development. Our
preliminary ChIP-seq data and functional analyses suggests that different SOX TFs can recruit BCAT to distinct
enhancers in a tissue specific manner. On some enhancers SOX and BCAT synergistically activate transcription
independent of TCFs. Other enhancers appear to be co-occupied by SOX, BCAT and TCFs, suggesting tertiary
complexes where SOX and TCF might cooperate or compete to bind DNA and BCAT to activate or represses
transcription. These data suggest novel regulatory mechanisms and indicate that SOXs may be wide-spread
unappreciated factors regulating Wnt responses. We propose to test this hypothesis with the following aims:
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that SOXs regulate the genomic recruitment of BCAT to lineage specific enhancers.
Aim 2: Determine how Sox17 and Bcat coregulate Wnt-responsive enhancers to control spatially restricted
 transcription in the embryo.
Aim 3: Determine the biochemical mechanisms by which SOX-BCAT-TCF complexes interact on DNA.
These studies will reveal the SOX-BCAT regulated GRN of gut development and provide a new paradigm
for how cell-specific Wnt-mediated transcription is regulated in development and disease."
10756968,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the mis-expression of the embryonic transcription factor
DUX4 in skeletal muscle. A major mechanism of DUX4-induced cell toxicity in FSHD muscle is through the
transcription of the HSATII pericentromeric repeats and their formation of single and double-stranded
intranuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. In this proposal, we will determine the molecular components
the RNP complexes and mechanisms of their cell toxicity. The significance of this proposal is that it will
establish mechanisms of DUX4-induced pathology in FSHD muscle that will support future therapeutic
interventions. The long-term goal of this project is to establish the mechanisms of DUX4-induced pathology in
FSHD muscle. The overall hypothesis is that expression of DUX4 in FSHD muscle results in the
accumulation of stable RNP complexes that alter the post-transcriptional regulation of other cellular RNAs and
modulates the innate immune response pathways to inhibit the normal response to double-stranded RNAs.
The specific aims of the proposal are: (Aim 1) Determine the RNAs and the proteins that comprise the
intranuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes and their contribution to cell toxicity and genome instability. (Aim 2)
Determine whether DUX4 regulates the selective degradation or translation of specific subsets of mRNAs.
(Aim 3) Test the hypothesis that interactions between DUX4 and components of the innate immune response
pathway represent a conserved function to modulate ISG induction by dsRNAs. Together, these aims will
further establish the molecular basis of FSHD pathophysiology and identify new opportunities for future
therapies."
10762443,"Project Summary
African Americans have a 6-fold higher H. pylori (Hp) infection than the non-Hispanic white population; however,
underlying gene(s) for this disparity remain elusive. We discovered that a human TP53 gene variant at amino
acid 47 exists predominantly in people of African descent. Macrophages containing the S47 variant are defective
in ferroptosis, M2 polarized and show more productive infections by Hp and other bacteria. Macrophage adaptive
response is essential for eliminating Hp infection and is suppressed in chronic infections that lead to gastritis.
Our collaborator, Dr. Keith Wilson, reported the role of Arg2 activation by Hp in suppressing the macrophage
response. Unbiased WT and S47 macrophage proteomics revealed marked differences in Liver X Receptor
activation, arginase II activity, inflammation, iron transport and antibacterial defense machinery which regulate
immune response and directly affect outcomes of bacterial infections. Although p53 is known to regulate immune
response, we are the first to discover the exact genetic variant causing the disparities. We will reverse the Hp
infection disparities in African Americans with the S47 SNP by in-depth mechanistic and therapeutic study.
Our human studies will give translational relevance to this project. We will test ~500 Hp seropositive African
American samples for the prevalence of S47 and other SNPs. Then we will focus on improving macrophage
response, Hp clearance and reduce chronic gastric dysplasia in S47 mice using Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonists.
We will test if LXR activation improves these outcomes for multiple Hp strains with differing virulence. Moreover,
we will generate a genome-wide map of macrophage binding of LXR to ‘fine tune’ its activity on macrophage
activation and eliminate undesired effect of hepatic steatosis.
Since Hp is found both extracellularly and within macrophages, specific depletion of immune cells will be
used to distinguish the role of macrophages from other tissue environment in H. pylori pathogenesis. These
studies will be validated by bone marrow swaps between WT and S47 mice. we will test macrophage
regulation and tissue environment for more. We will prioritize and test pathways associated with LXR such
as arginase pathway (Arg2, Slc7a2), iron transport (Tfrc, Slc40a1, Fth1) and innate immune proteins (TLR3 and
TLR7) as novel therapeutic targets. Lastly, we will test macrophage regulatory factors (NOTCH1 and
mTOR), energy metabolism (switching from ox-phos to glycolysis by Metformin) and polyamine pathway
(DFMO-polyamine synthesis inhibitor) in fine tuning LXR agonist induced reversal of anti-inflammatory
polarization in S47 mice, clearance of Hp infection and reduction of gastric dysplasia.
This proposal will a) improve our understanding of the biological mechanism for the disparity in Hp infection in
African Americans and b) provide several therapeutic avenues to improve clearance of Hp infection and gastritis.
This project is a stepping stone for human studies in personalized medicine to address this health disparity. Hp
infection has been deemed of critical importance in the African American minority, by the NIDDK."
10766734,"Liver is the central metabolic hub that coordinates the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The bioactive derivative of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA) was shown to regulate a number of major metabolic genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and glucokinase among others. Expression levels of these genes undergo profound changes during metabolic transitions such as adaptation to starvation, or in response to insufficient insulin signaling during type 1 diabetes. However, it is not known whether the levels of RA in liver change during such metabolic remodeling, and how the changes in RA levels, in turn, might affect the liver’s capacity for metabolic adaptation. To start addressing this fundamental gap in our knowledge, we have carried out preliminary studies targeting hepatic retinoid metabolism and signaling in the well-fed state, in starvation, and in type 1 diabetes. These initial studies have yielded several novel and paradigm-shifting observations. First of all, our preliminary data indicate that fed-to- starved transition is associated with significant downregulation of hepatic RA biosynthesis and signaling that stems from the downregulation of hepatic retinol dehydrogenase activity, which is the rate-limiting step in RA biosynthesis. Second, our preliminary studies suggest that the decrease in the overall hepatic retinol dehydrogenase activity is associated with changes in subcellular localization of retinol dehydrogenase 10 and a decrease in its overall cellular abundance. Third, our preliminary studies suggest that, in contrast to starvation, the untreated type 1 diabetes is associated with upregulation of RA biosynthesis and signaling. This upregulation of RA biosynthesis appears to come about as a result of an increase in hepatic retinol dehydrogenase activity, which, in turn, correlates with the increase in cellular abundance of RDH10 and changes in its subcellular localization. Taken together, our preliminary studies suggest that the downregulation of hepatic RA biosynthesis and signaling is critical for an orderly adaptation to starvation. In contrast, the upregulation of hepatic RA biosynthesis and signaling in type 1 diabetes might be a harmful outcome contributing to the metabolic inflexibility associated with this disease. Importantly, our initial findings suggest the existence of a novel, previously unrecognized mechanism by which the hepatic RA biosynthesis is regulated through adjustments in subcellular localization and cellular abundance of retinol dehydrogenase 10. In this application, we propose to examine these novel concepts through the following Specific Aims: 1) to characterize the hepatic retinoid metabolism and signaling in the well-fed state and in starvation; and 2) to investigate the hepatic retinoid metabolism and signaling in type 1 diabetes. The results of these studies will uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordination of RA levels with metabolic status of liver and will lay the foundation for development of better informed therapies targeting metabolic disease."

Circadian clocks are intracellular enzymatic systems that provide a biochemical
representation of local time with profound consequences to health across diverse
organisms. Unlike most enzymes, biological clocks need to be insensitive to a range
of physiological temperatures and cellular energy levels so that organisms can
anticipate dawn and dusk reliably. However, the mechanisms by which circadian
clocks in any organism achieve insensitivity to temperature (i.e., temperature
compensation) and cellular energy levels (i.e., metabolic compensation) are far from
understood. Therefore, the overall vision of the LiWang lab for the next five years is to
elucidate the mechanisms of temperature compensation and metabolic
compensation in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Over the past 20 years, we
have made many impactful discoveries on mechanism of the cyanobacterial clock
and developed innovative methodologies and tools along the way. Thus, we are very
well positioned to succeed at filling critical gaps in knowledge in the field of
biological timekeeping. A major expected outcome of the work proposed here is a
detailed cause-and-effect model linking clock protein behavior and interactions to
temperature and metabolic compensation phenotypes in vivo."
10757754,"Addiction involves brain systems mediating internal states of motivation, arousal and reward, as well as
emotions. Such internal states influence goal-directed behaviors and decision-making. A common feature of
such internal states is their valence and their persistence: they can have a positive or negative valence, and
can outlast their triggering stimulus for many minutes. However the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie
the persistence of internal states, and their relationship to the encoding of valence, are poorly understood.
 Drosophila provides a tractable genetic model organism for studying how neuromodulators act on neural
circuits to control persistent internal states that govern goal-directed behavior and decision-making. We have
discovered that P1 interneurons, which control male courtship behavior, can when activated promote a
persistent internal state of social arousal or motivation, which can last for minutes. In a publication supported
by the base grant, we have obtained evidence of a link between P1 interneurons and neurons that respond to
octopamine (OA), an insect homolog of norepinephrine (NE), which is known to facilitate psychostimulant self-
administration in rodents. We have also identified a downstream target of P1 neurons, called pCd cells, which
appear to play a key requisite role in determining the persistence of an internal state of social arousal.
 During the extension period, we will continue our studies of how P1 neurons promote a rewarding internal
state, and the relationship of these mechanisms to the positive valence, or rewarding nature, of P1 stimulation.
In the first 2 years, we will focus on pursuing Aims 3 and 4 of the base grant. These aims were: Aim 3) to test
the hypothesis that P1 neuron activation is positively valenced and rewarding; Aim 4) to investigate
neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in P1 reward learning. In unpublished experiments, we have
discovered that activation of P1 neurons can produce a real-time place preference (RTPP), and that it can also
serve as an unconditional stimulus (US) for conditioned olfactory preference (COP). Both of these findings
indicate that P1 activation is positively valenced, and that it can be rewarding. We plan to investigate whether
plasticity during COP occurs at or downstream of P1 neurons, and whether P1 neurons are necessary for
expression of the COP (Aim 3). Preliminary experiments suggest that dopamine (DA) may play a role in
modulating the effects effects of P1 stimulation. We will confirm and extend these findings, and also investigate
the role(s) of other neuromodulators including biogenic amines such as octopamine (OA), which we have
shown to modulate the effect of P1 stimulation to activate aSP2 neurons that control social behavior9.
Furthermore, we will investigate whether mushroom body (MB) neurons involved in reward learning are also
involved in P1-mediated odor conditioning (Aim 4). Given previous data, we expect to find a role for the MB,
but precisely which subset of MB neurons are involved is not clear.
In Merit Extension Aim 5, we will investigate the role of other neuromodulators in P1-induced persistent
social arousal and reward learning. Candidate neuromodulatory targets of P1 neurons include serotonergic
(Trh+) neurons, a subset of which is activated in response to P1 stimulation (preliminary results), and
neuropeptide F (NPF), which has been implicated in reward in other contexts. We will approach this problem
using functional connectomics, in which optogenetic activation of P1 neurons is combined with calcium imaging
in populations containing putative neuromodulatory targets of these cells. Target neurons can be “filled” using
photo-activatable GFP (PA-GFP), and their morphology used as a “search image” to identify specific genetic
drivers that label that subset of cells. Using these drivers, activation and silencing of these neurons can be
performed in the context of both P1-mediated reward (RTPP and COP assays), and persistent social arousal.
We have successfully established this approach and used it to identify pCd neurons, which are persistently
activated by P1 neurons and required for persistent social behaviors triggered by P1 activation. As a
complementary approach, we will take advantage of recent advances that we have made in techniques for
whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the adult brain, which allow identification of candidate
follower cells activated by optogenetic stimulation of P1 neurons using FISH probes for hr38, an immediate
early gene (analogous to c-fos) in Drosophila. Double-label FISH can be performed using hr38 and probes for
neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or neuropeptides, to identify neuromodulators expressed in P1 targets.
A fundamental question is whether the mechanism mediating P1-induced persistent activity is also involved in
reward. To address this question, in Merit Extension Aim 6 we will investigate the role of pCd neurons in P1-
mediated reward learning, using functional manipulations of these cells. Preliminary data suggest that
persistent activation of pCd neurons by P1 cells is modulated by DA, and we will investigate how this
modulatory influence is exerted. We anticipate that these experiments will yield general principles of how
persistent internal reward states are encoded by brains, with potentially broad relevance across phylogeny."
10750962,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy; group A Streptococcus) is the most prolific pathogen in the number of distinct
diseases it is responsible for. Most commonly Spy is a cause of childhood acute pharyngitis (strep throat), but it
is also a top-10-pathogen in mortality that results in more than half a million deaths annually through invasive
infections and immune diseases that include necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, and acute rheumatic
fever. Despite their public health importance, the pathogenesis of these severe diseases is poorly understood,
and they remain challenging to treat. Our long-term goal seeks to determine how Spy virulence factors contribute
to the development of these more severe forms of disease so that effective therapeutic countermeasures can
be developed. Our previous studies show that the streptococcal protease SpeB acts directly on the host cytokine
pro-IL-1β to induce inflammatory pathology during invasive infection. We hypothesize that additional proteins
targeted by SpeB, from both host and microbe, contribute to the proinflammatory responses we see during
infection. In our preliminary data, we have characterized the biochemical activity of SpeB and identified two of
its substrates that cooperatively lead to fundamental shifts in pathogenesis. In our first aim, we examine how
SpeB regulates the activities of M protein, a pleiotropic virulence factor with numerous host targets. By
eliminating domains specific for the binding of some host molecules or anchoring of M protein to the Spy surface,
SpeB directly contributes to pathological complications of infection like glomerulonephritis and toxic shock
syndrome. In our second aim, we define the molecular determinates of how SpeB blocks signaling by the
CovR/CovS two-component regulator by targeting its agonist, the host defense peptide LL-37. This mechanism
results in a positive-feedback loop for SpeB production and repression of capsule and other cell surface factors
that alter antimicrobial resistance, detection by the host, and promotes inflammation and disease complications.
Both aims take advantage of new genetic and biochemical tools we developed for targeted control and specific
detection of SpeB and its substrates. These innovations allow us for the first time to separate activities for these
multifunctional proteins and examine in vivo dramatic switch in the virulence strategy of Spy regulated by SpeB.
The expected contribution of the proposed research is an expanded understanding of how Spy pathogenesis is
regulated that provides attractive therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of severe Spy disease and
insights into orthologous systems of other pathogens highly relevant to the NIAID mission."

The objective of the proposed research is to identify molecular mechanisms linking the protective role of culture
to blood pressure regulation, a major risk factor for stroke in Yup'ik Alaska Native people. The prevalence of
stroke is higher among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations than in any other U.S. racial/ethnic
group. Chronic psychological stress increases the risk for hypertension, and is the most frequently cited stroke
risk factor in AIAN populations. The prevalence of stroke has increased over the past 25 years, and is likely
brought on by chronic stressors including historical trauma, cultural change and adverse socioeconomic
conditions which, in turn, increases the likelihood of unhealthy behavioral coping responses (e.g., smoking,
reduced exercise, poor sleep and overeating). However, our previous research has shown that both strong
adherence to Yup'ik cultural traditions (enculturation) and dual adherence to Yup'ik and White culture
(biculturalism) are associated with healthier blood pressure when compared to Yup'ik individuals adhering to a
more Western lifestyle (acculturation). No previous research has identified the molecular events underlying the
basis for the protective effects of enculturation/biculturalism-induced resilience (EBIR) on risk for hypertension,
representing a critical barrier to the development of culturally effective interventions aimed at promoting health.
The proposed research examines the role of EBIR at each step of the stress-disease cascade – a model based
on extensive research linking chronic stressful events to biological mechanisms and diseases such as
hypertension. We hypothesize that EBIR blocks or buffers adverse individual and environmental stressors
resulting in reduced metabolic dysfunction and inflammation, inhibition of epigenetic dysregulation, and
maintenance of leukocyte telomere length, all or some of which lead to healthy blood pressure. We test these
hypotheses by addressing the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA1 - Conduct latent class analysis using self-
reported data about enculturation, biculturalism, and chronic stress from 800 Yup'ik participants to form classes
based on their degree of EBIR/stress (SA1a), followed by evaluating the relationship between EBIR/stress latent
classes and maladaptive health-related behaviors as well as between blood pressure, the main study outcome
measure (SA1b); SA2 - Evaluate the association between EBIR/stress latent classes with metabolic dysfunction
(salivary cortisol, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, and lipid levels), mitochondrial allostatic load, and
chronic low-grade inflammation; and SA3 - Determine the impact of EBIR/stress latent classes on epigenome-
wide DNA methylation and downstream changes in gene expression (SA3a) as well as quantify the association
between methylation sites and blood pressure (SA3b), and test whether differential methylation mediates the
association between EBIR/stress latent classes and blood pressure (SA3c). We will also evaluate leukocyte
telomere length among individuals in each of the EBIR/stress latent classes (SA3d) in order to determine whether
EBIR reduces the impact of chronic stress on premature telomere shortening, an indicator of biological aging."

assistance will be used to develop and conduct a three day conference and training seminar
entitled ""National Egg Regulatory Officials' Annual Conference and Training
Seminar"". NERO's long term objective is to increase conference attendance so that all
fifty states and the District of Columbia are represented at the annual conference. Many
states do not have travel funding to attend the Annual Conference and Training Seminar.
Grant assistance will enable more states to attend the Conference. The project will assist
NERO with the 2021 conference as well as our 2022, 2023, 20243 and 2025 conference.
NERO's mission is to promote the marketing of safe, fresh and accurately labeled shell eggs
and egg products through the development of uniform, science-based and coordinated
state and Federal regulations. The Annual Conference and Training Seminar is designed to
achieve this goal by providing educational segments related to current egg safety and
quality issues and the opportuntity for state, Federal and industry representatives to
intereact and share scientific data, public policies and ideas. A key feature of the
conference is the presentation of information related to specific issues that is then referred
to NERO's Committees comprised of specialists in that area. The committees review the
information and develop specific recommendations for the most effective and cost efficient
method of achieving the desired result. NERO members use these recommendations to
implement regulations and policies.
The conference for which support is being sought will specifically address FDA Egg Rule,
new technologies, food safety issues related to small flock egg production, labeling and
data management, as well as the newly reviewed Egg Regulatory Program Standards.
Respresentation of every state at the annual conference and training seminar is critical to
achieve NERO's goal of uniform, science-based and coordinated state and Federal
regulations and policies in these areas. Funding for this grant proposal will increase the

The long term goal of the proposed study is to determine, at the molecular level, mechanisms and
functions of chromatin regulation at a global level. Chromatin regulation profoundly affects a wide
variety of DNA-dependent processes, including transcription, DNA replication, recombination, DNA
repair, and DNA damage response. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of chromatin regulation is a
necessary prerequisite for understanding how these essential processes are controlled. One of the
major challenges the chromatin field is to elucidate how chromatin is globally reprogrammed during
processes like cell fate determination, development and cell-cycle control. This is a particularly
important challenge, because it was recently determined that mutations in chromatin regulators
represent one major class of so called cancer driver mutations, yet how these mutations drive cancer
remains unknown. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of chromatin regulation impacts not only the
researchers who study fundamental principles of DNA-dependent processes, but also cancer biologists.
 We have previously elucidated how chromatin regulation affects transcription, DNA replication,
S phase checkpoint and recombination using budding yeast as a model organism. Like most studies in
the field, we did our work during the mitotic cell-cycle. However, yeast cells in the wild, like other
eukaryotic cells, spend most of their time in quiescence. Quiescence is associated with massive
chromatin reprogramming for global condensation. Because the vast majority of work on chromatin
regulation has been done during mitotic cell-cycle, we have little idea of how chromatin is regulated
during the time cells spend most of their time. In order to understand the whole picture of chromatin
regulation in vivo, it is essential to understand mechanisms and functions of chromatin regulation during
quiescence. In the next funding period, we will ask the following questions in quiescent state: 1) How is
chromatin globally reprogrammed by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors? 2) How are
chromatin domains and nucleosome array folding regulated? 3) How is gene expression regulated
post-transcriptionally at a global scale? We will use the combination of genomics, molecular genetics,
EM, modeling and biochemistry to identify novel mechanisms by which highly conserved chromatin
regulators function to massively reprogram chromatin in a genome-wide scale. In the long run, these
studies will allow us to compare and integrate the principles of chromatin regulation throughout the
mitotic cell-cycle and quiescence, such that we can obtain the full picture of chromatin regulation."

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in military personnel is commonly caused by noise- or blast-related
damage to the auditory periphery (cochlea) and/or the central system, which includes changes in the integrity
of the cochlear partition and cellular death along the auditory pathway. Hearing loss is often permanent, and
there exist no cures for sustained injuries. The current proposal seeks to characterize the signal processing
along the auditory pathway by establishing the structure-function relationship in both normal ears and with
various types of SNHL. The overall goal is to improve the diagnosis of SNHL within the clinic by separating
contributions from cochlear (sensory) and retro-cochlear (neural) loss. We will combine a novel, state-of-the-art
measurement technique (optical coherence tomography, OCT) with recordings that are already available in the
clinic [i.e., distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) in the ear canal and frequency-following
responses (FFR) from the cortex] so that the cochlear mechanics and the detrimental effects of noise- or blast-
exposure can be evaluated at different stages along the auditory pathway. As of now, OCT measures from the
cochlea cannot be recorded from humans, but we expect that the combination of DPOAE and FFR provides a
differential diagnosis of SNHL that distinguishes damage of the sensory versus neural component. Aim 1 of
this proposal will form the foundation of the study by determining how DPOAEs and FFRs relate to cochlear
micromechanics in normal gerbil ears. The experimental results will be used to develop a Best Approximation
Model (BAM) that will predict cochlear function using DPOAEs and FFRs. In Aim 2 we will explore how various
forms of SNHL change the underlying cochlear mechanics with the specific design to differentially diagnose
sensory and neural hearing loss and establish how these changes can be quantified using a combination of
DPOAE and FFR measurements. These results will further validate the BAM developed under Aim 1. In Aim 3
we will apply the knowledge obtained in animals to humans that suffer from different types of SNHL to improve
the clinical differential diagnosis of an SNHL using DPOAEs, FFRs, and the BAM. Using direct and
simultaneous measurements along the auditory pathway, the signal processing under these conditions will be
quantified in detail. The proposed research will advance our understanding of sound processing within the
auditory system, especially at low frequencies that are important for speech and provide critical information to
improve our ability to diagnose and develop new treatments for SNHL. This will benefit our Veterans, many of
whom suffer from noise/blast-induced hearing loss."
10752627,"Background: Chronic disease and preventive care that occurs within primary care was delayed or deferred in
the acute COVID-19 crisis, which is expected to have profound impacts on the health of VA patients. In
response, the VHA Office of Primary Care (OPC) launched the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI) on March
1st, 2021 to support primary care in delivering needed primary care services. This innovative care coordination
intervention leverages three main components: 1) development of an electronic dashboard utilizing 10
common chronic and preventive care quality measures; 2) using nurse care managers for proactive virtual care
visits; and 3) the use of structured electronic health record note template to complete needed care. Our current
work has shown substantial PHI use and diffusion; however, little is known about implementation and
outcomes from PHI uptake. Our proposal will address these knowledge gaps and provide needed evidence on
mitigation strategies being supported by the OPC.
Significance/Impact: This study will build on ongoing collaborations between VA’s OPC and health services
researchers and provide needed evidence that the VA health system can use to better serve Veterans in
ongoing pandemic response and recovery. A key component of our work will assess whether national efforts to
mitigate effects of the pandemic were effective in reducing adverse health impacts.
Innovation: Our work will be the first to evaluate the implementation of a multi-component care coordination
intervention to support chronic and preventive care after the disruption to primary care delivery caused by the
pandemic.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify key factors associated with use of PHI at 1 year as a care coordination
intervention to improve coordination of chronic and preventive disease in primary care Aim 2: Understand
implementation of the PHI to deliver chronic and preventive care from the perspectives of a) clinic frontline staff
(leaders, PCPs, and nurse care managers) and b) Veterans who received the PHI. Aim 3: Examine impact of
PHI tool on primary care quality (diabetes, hypertension, and colon cancer screening) and potentially
preventable utilization.
Methodology: This rapid-cycle evaluation will use both quantitative and qualitative approaches to
understanding the implementation and outcomes from the OPC’s PHI intervention. Aim 1: We will use a multi-
level modeling approach to examine patient-level variation in rates of PHI-use to identify the extent to which
Veteran, provider, or clinic-factors explain this variation. Aim 2: We will conduct semi-structured interviews
among clinic staff to understand the implementation of PHI and Veteran experience of PHI-directed care. Aim
3: We will conduct a propensity scored matched analysis, matching patients who received PHI intervention to a
comparison group who did not receive PHI to estimate the impacts on quality and utilization measures using a
series of difference-in-differences regression models.
Implementation/Next Steps: Together, work from these aims will provide key evidence for VA policymakers
on the impact of a large-scale care coordination intervention on mitigating the impact COVID-19 on chronic and
preventive care."
10763362,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this application is to establish avenues through which we can harness the intestinal microbiota
to enhance mucosal immune responses against Clostridium difficile. C. difficile infection (CDI) is a common
cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients and represents a major health threat due to frequent treatment failures
and high risks of colectomy and mortality. Patients with recurrent CDI do not benefit from conventional
antimicrobial therapies; while transplantation of fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors might be a valid
option, regulation of fecal transplantation is problematic. In our preliminary data we show for the first time a
remarkable impact of microbiota-derived acetate on CDI, which may constitute a potential therapeutic avenue.
We show that acetate enhances neutrophil and innate lymphoid cells of type 3 (ILC3) responses through the
surface receptor FFAR2. Moreover, we show that lack of a decoy receptor for IL-22, known as IL-22 binding
protein (IL-22BP), amplifies the activity of IL-22 and modifies the microbiota, strengthening its resistance to CDI.
We propose three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the mechanisms through which acetate-FFAR2
signaling activates the neutrophil response to CDI. We will perform in vitro functional and transcriptional
experiments to determine whether FFAR2 promotes neutrophil recruitment to chemoattractants, upregulates
expression of inflammasome components, alters the neutrophil transcriptional profile, and/or modifies neutrophil
metabolism. The impact of acetate on human neutrophils will be examined as well. In Specific Aim 2, using newly
generated mice lacking FFAR2 in ILC3s, along with mice lacking FFAR2 in neutrophils, we will determine
whether FFAR2 mediated activation of ILC3s is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the protective effect of
acetate in vivo. Furthermore, we will determine whether FFAR2 impacts ILC3-mediated lymphoid organogenesis
in the steady state and whether FFAR2 modifies the transcriptome and/or metabolism of mouse and human
ILC3s. Finally, we will ascertain whether acetate can be used in a therapeutic mode. In Specific Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that lack of IL-22BP and the resulting increased basal activity of IL-22 modify the intestinal
microbiota in a manner that facilitates the colonization of bacterial cohorts that enhance protection against CDI.
This work is significant because it addresses the major health burden of dysbiosis and CDI, is innovative because
it evaluates alternative therapeutic approaches based on acetate and/or blockade of IL-22BP rather than live
microbiota and has potential to translate into novel treatments with implications for health and productivity. The
project will be accomplished through the ongoing collaboration between the Colonna lab in USA and the Vinolo
lab in Brazil, each with distinct and complementary sets of expertise on CDI, short chain fatty acids, and mucosal
innate immunity that must be combined to successfully complete this project. The synergy between the two labs
has already generated results that serve as the basis for this proposal and will produce fundamental research
on the impact of the microbiota on mucosal responses to CDI and unveil new potential therapies."
10753522,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rapid evolutionary adaptation is a foundational process in biology and at the core of many issues facing humanity
including cancer, bacterial and viral diseases, evolution of drug and pesticide resistance, and biological response
to global change. Many traits that evolve rapidly are complex and polygenic, and we lack a comprehensive
understanding of the genetic and evolutionary dynamics of rapid evolution in natural populations. Pigmentation
is a complex phenotype determined by many loci. From the peppered moth to the pocket mouse, adaptive
coloration is widely observed and, in many cases, a few large effect loci have been identified and then shown
mechanistically to be responsible. Patterns of pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster are also thought to be
adaptive, exhibiting clines at multiple scales, yet the genetic architecture and evolutionary dynamics are
substantially more complex: body segments exhibit a variety of colors and patterns, dozens of loci affecting
pigmentation have been verified, and patterns among different segments are not always highly correlated. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that pigmentation can evolve very rapidly and cyclically in natural populations,
fluctuating seasonally between dark coloration post-winter and light coloration post-summer. Hundreds of alleles
change in frequency and are associated with the rapid evolution of pigmentation phenotype. Rapid seasonal
evolution of pigmentation in D. melanogaster is not an example of a few loci of large effect, but represents a
different paradigm underpinning the rapid evolution of complex traits. The need for rapid change is associated
with a plastic response in which temperature causes an immediate change in pigmentation during development,
but thermal plasticity does not explain the seasonal pigmentation response. We observe both durable shifts in
midpoints as well as an increase in the distribution of the extremes. Shifts in population midpoint may not be due
to the same set of loci as those that drive the phenotypic extremes. There are more than 20 known pigmentation
loci controlled by cis regulation and associated with a diverse set of transcription factors. Pigmentation changes
could be a result of shifting frequencies in trans factors that trigger cis regulation among a large number of loci,
or it could be changes in cis effects directly. The targets of selection may be small in number or may represent
a larger mutational target, and testing parallelism will enable us to determine the mutational target size. In this
proposal we survey the genetics of rapid evolution in pigmentation with the goal of answering the following
questions: Are the loci responsible for the average shift in pigmentation the same as loci in phenotypic extremes?
Are the targets of rapid directional selection the same among populations? Are pigmentation traits directly
responsible for rapid adaptation? Are cis regulatory changes occurring in the same set of loci at different spatial
and temporal scales? To accomplish these goals we have planned a comprehensive set of experiments, using
an innovative approach and novel experimental material, that will provide fundamental insight into the genetics
of rapid evolution in natural populations."

 Development of an organism requires both stereotyped and stochastic patterning. Stereotyped patterning
robustly generates nearly identical structures across individuals. In contrast, stochastic cell fate specification
produces randomized patterns that are unique to each individual. Stochastic fate decisions are required for the
development of many sensory organs, including visual and olfactory systems. Despite their importance, how the
molecular mechanisms controlling stereotyped and random patterns intersect within the same tissue has not
been addressed. This project aims to determine how gene regulatory mechanisms are tuned to generate highly
regular patterns and stochastic patterns in the same tissue using the Drosophila eye as a model.
 The Drosophila eye is composed of ~800 ommatidia in a near perfect array. Each ommatidium comprises
eight photoreceptors (R1-8) which develop in a predictable fashion. As photoreceptors are differentiating during
larval eye development, a wave of morphogenesis driven by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling drives the highly
reproducible structure of the eye. Underlying the uniform morphology of the fly eye is a random pattern of
photoreceptor subtypes. Two R7 photoreceptor subtypes are defined by expression of light-detecting Rhodopsin
proteins. Random patterning of these two R7 subtypes is controlled by stochastic ON/OFF expression of the
transcription factor, Spineless (Ss). SsON R7s express Rhodopsin 4 (Rh4), whereas SsOFF R7s express
Rhodopsin 3 (Rh3). ss is regulated by an interplay of transcription and chromatin regulation during larval eye
development.
 I found that Hh signaling plays a second role in eye development to regulate stochastic patterning. hh
mutants display a reduction in the percentage of SsON R7s. Cubitus Interruptus (Ci), an effector of Hh signaling,
binds at an eye specific enhancer in ss. This site overlaps with a binding site for Klumpfuss (Klu), a repressor of
ss, suggesting competitive binding and regulation.
 I hypothesize that Hh signaling is finely tuned to drive stereotyped eye patterning and induce ss
transcription in precursors to generate stochastic R7 subtype patterning. I will test this hypothesis by 1)
Determining how the Hh pathway regulates stochastic ss expression, 2) Describing how antagonism between
Ci and Klu regulates ss expression, and 3) Determining how Hh signaling and chromatin regulation are integrated
at the ss locus. Together, these experiments will provide the first analysis of coordination between stochastic
and stereotyped gene expression within a single tissue and will enhance our mechanistic understanding of
stochastic cell fate specification."

 Approximately 9.1% of US adolescents (11.2% girls, 7.0% boys) experience social anxiety,1 a disorder
characterized by difficulty with and fear of social interactions.2 Peer social interactions are the building blocks
of socioemotional and neural development during adolescence. Processes important for social interaction,
including social attention and mentalizing, the ability to interpret the intentions and emotions of others,3 are in
flux during adolescence,4,5 with puberty playing a particularly influential role in reorienting attention towards
peers6 and the development of the mentalizing network7 and behavior.8 Puberty may be a sensitive period
during which the integration of social attention and mentalizing processes could solidify or alter trajectories
towards social anxiety, particularly in individuals already at elevated risk for social anxiety. The current grant
will capitalize on two separate samples (one cross-sectional and one longitudinal) to examine puberty as a
sensitive period for the integration of social attention and mentalizing processes (both behavioral and neural)
and risk for social anxiety. Study 1 will use cross-sectional data, collected in 11- and 12-year-old adolescents.
Adolescents will complete an fMRI mentalizing task and participate in a social interaction while mobile eye-
tracking data are collected. The social interaction will be coded for mentalizing language/behaviors.
Adolescents will be assessed for, and self-report, pubertal status. Through Study 1, I will examine puberty as a
sensitive period for the integration of naturalistic social attention and spontaneous mentalizing (Aim 1). Study 2
will use longitudinal data from a completed dataset. Adolescents were assessed for fearful temperament, a risk
factor for social anxiety,9 at 2 years. Adolescents participated in a social interaction and self-reported pubertal
status at 12 years. Participants self-reported social anxiety at 15 years. As in Study 1, the social interaction will
be coded for mentalizing language/behaviors. Through Study 2, I will examine puberty-linked longitudinal
relations between spontaneous mentalizing, fearful temperament and social anxiety (Aim 2). Findings will
provide information about the role of puberty in socioemotional development and risk for social anxiety.
 The current study is designed with an integrated training plan that will prepare the fellowship applicant for a
future career as a developmental social neuroscientist. The three overarching training goals are: 1) Advanced
training in naturalistic neuroscience methodology and data analysis and mentalizing. 2) Obtain conceptual and
methodological training in puberty and associated psychopathology risk. 3) Advance training and professional
development in preparation for an independent research career. These training goals will effectively prepare
the applicant for the next steps in the desired career path of becoming a developmental social neuroscientist
as well as lay the foundation for a future research program examining the co-development of social attention
and mentalizing as a potential mechanism underlying social anxiety risk."
10830911,"Background: Hypertension and blood pressure (BP) control inequities are a leading modifiable risk factor for
the higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality experienced by racial/ethnic minority
Americans. Team based care, an evidence-based practice, may be effective in reducing BP control disparities.
However, despite VA Primary Aligned Care Team (PACT) implementation, BP control race/ethnic inequities
persist. This highlights a need tailored bundle of implementation strategies (i.e., playbook) to address the
unique needs of minority Veterans. The 2020 VA/DoD Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline recommends a
threshold for medication initiation in high CVD-risk patients and for medication intensification in all hypertensive
patients be lowered by 10 mm Hg (vs older guidelines) to systolic BP 130 mm Hg (intensive BP control), if
aligned with clinical judgement and patient preference. Achieving and maintaining intensive BP control could
avert half a million CVD events in the US overall over 10 years, however there is a need for implementation
playbooks that ensure the known benefits of intensive BP control are experienced equally.
Significance: Our goal is to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality disparities in VHA by
optimizing antihypertensive medication management in PACT. Achieving and maintaining intensive BP control
may avert half a million CVD events over 10 years in the US.
Innovation and Impact: Our study will leverage the VHA Office of Health Equity Primary Care Equity
Dashboard (PCED) launched in 2021, an audit feedback tool, may be an important strategy to a population
health management approach, to support team-based playbooks designed to mitigate hypertension disparities
and support evidence based practice update among race/ethnic minority Veterans.
Specific Aims: Aim 1) Contrast patient-, provider-, and facility-level factors associated with intensive
antihypertensive management (initiation, adherence, and intensification) and BP control by race/ethnicity; Aim
2) Using qualitative data, identify patient, provider- and facility-barriers and facilitators relevant to intensive
antihypertensive management (initiation, adherence, and intensification) and BP control by race/ethnicity; and
Aim 3) Codesign two intensive BP control population health management implementation playbooks tailored to
reduce BP inequities and prototype and pilot test the playbooks in PACT.
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will complete a hierarchical analysis of patient (e.g. sex, age, socio-demographics,
comorbidities, non-VA community and virtual healthcare use), provider (e.g. specialty, patient-provider visit
frequency), and facility (e.g. urban/rural status, geographic location, % racial minorities served, academic
affiliation, PACT implementation) factors associated with intensive BP management. In Aim 2, applying the
Theoretical Domains Framework in conjunction with the Chronic Care Model, we will collect and analyze semi-
structured interview data from 120 Veterans and 60 PACT staff and providers from the Salt Lake City and DC
VAMCs. In Aim 3, with our stakeholders we will identify and prioritize multilevel barriers improve equitable BP
control. Next, we will link the barriers to evidence-based behavior change techniques and tools, such as
leveraging the PCED. We will iteratively tailor and prototype two multilevel playbooks, one will focus on the
facility/team level and the other on the provider/patient level. We will pilot both playbooks at the Salt Lake City
and DC VAMCs to collect usability, feasibility, and acceptance data.
Next Steps/Implementation: By completing these aims, we will provide an actionable, evidence-based, and
comprehensive understanding of the gaps and barriers related to intensive BP control in the VHA. This
knowledge will lead to an evaluation study of the tailored intensive BP management implementation playbooks."

University of Kansas Medical Center Research Institute, Inc.
Advancement in antiretroviral therapy (ART) has clearly led to a serious increase in the prevalence of non-
infectious cardio-pulmonary complications among HIV-infected individuals including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and HIV-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (HIV-PAH). In fact, recent reports
suggest that pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension (PH) precede the airway
destruction/emphysema development and that PH and COPD coexist in HIV-infected individuals. Significant
number of previous findings including from our lab consistently suggest increased risk for pulmonary vascular
dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals who abuse illicit drugs compared to HIV-infected non-drug users or un-
infected drug abusers. Understanding the mechanisms by which cocaine and HIV-1 trigger pulmonary vascular
injury is needed to develop preventive and early diagnosis strategies for patients at risk of HIV-PAH.
Pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are one of the primary cell-types that undergo hyperplasia
during vascular remodeling. The salient finding in all our published reports is the synergistic or additive
enhancement in the proliferation of PASMCs exposed to both HIV protein(s) and cocaine. Recently, long
noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of diverse biological process including cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Based on our published and recent preliminary findings we hypothesize that
alteration in the levels of lncRNA:ENST-536 in response to HIV-protein(s) and/or cocaine in smooth muscle
cells promote pulmonary vascular remodeling and cardio-pulmonary complications. In the first aim we will
examine if changes in the expression of ENST-536 lncRNA and its nearby tumor suppressive gene, HOXB13
regulate the HIV-Tat and cocaine mediated changes in the smooth muscle phenotype. In the second aim, we
will investigate how the interactions between lncRNA ENST-536 and RNA binding protein(s) (RBP) regulate
the HIV-Tat and cocaine mediated smooth muscle dysfunction.Third aim will be focused on investigating the in-
vivo role of lncRNA ENST-536 and HOXB13 in the pulmonary vascular dysfunction and right ventricular failure
using pre-clinical animal model These studies are innovative because to the best of our knowledge it will be the
first attempt to understand the potential link between the role of LncRNA, RBP and HOXB13 in the HIV-1
and/or cocaine mediated pulmonary vascular remodeling. The proposed research is significant because it will
enhance our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of HIV-PAH and will fulfill
the purpose of NOT-HL-19-677 (SEARCH: Stimulating ExplorAtory Research on HIV/AIDS Contribution
to Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep Comorbidities) in search of novel mechanisms involved in HIV-associated

 Mutations in β-cardiac myosin cause cardiomyopathies, which are leading causes of sudden cardiac death.
There are currently no cures for cardiomyopathies. Drugs targeting β-cardiac myosin would transform
treatment of cardiomyopathies and heart failure, the leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States.
 Efforts to develop new therapeutics have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of how
mutations in β-cardiac myosin cause cardiomyopathy and of how existing compounds targeting myosins
achieve specificity. Recent studies have found that several hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) variants
release myosin motors from an auto-inhibited state where two myosin motors fold back on each other.
Unfortunately, only a small subset of cardiomyopathy variants has been functionally characterized, even
though insight into a variant’s molecular effects is crucial for determining pathogenicity and predicting drug
response. Drugs targeting β-cardiac myosin need to achieve a high degree of specificity to avoid disrupting
critical functions carried out by other myosin proteins. Though the field has focused on sequence differences at
compound binding sites, one myosin inhibitor discovered in high throughput screens is highly specific even
though sensitive and insensitive myosin isoforms share identical sequences at its binding site. This suggests
structural dynamics at the binding site are an important determinant of specificity.
 We hypothesize that hidden structural states during equilibrium fluctuations of myosin motors determine
functional effects of mutations and the specificity of compounds targeting myosins. We propose using
molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the effects of a large number of β-cardiac mutations and to
compare pocket openings between myosin isoforms. We will leverage our unique combination of enormous
computational power and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.
 Aim 1 is to identify β-cardiac myosin mutations that alter the balance of active and auto-inhibited states.
Specifically, we will investigate the effects of HCM variants without functional data, dilated cardiomyopathy
variants, and “variants of unknown significance.” Aim 1 directly addresses the NIH’s goals of investigating new
pathobiological mechanisms and leveraging data science to open new frontiers in biomedical research.
 Aim 2 is to predict drug specificity based on differences in conformational ensembles of myosin isoforms.
In particular, we will compare pocket opening probabilities at the binding sites of three clinically relevant
compounds before designing and experimentally testing novel compounds that bind specific pockets in β-
cardiac myosin. Aim 2 directly addresses the NIH’s goals of developing novel therapeutic strategies.
 Together, these results will inform our understanding of how mutations in β-cardiac myosin cause
cardiomyopathies and advance drug discovery for cardiac disease."

The goal of this fellowship is to provide excellent multidisciplinary training in psycholinguistics, functional
neuroanatomy, and intracranial neurophysiology by developing mechanistic understanding of expressive
language function in the multiple regions in the medial frontal wall, specifically the supplementary motor area
(SMA) and preSMA. Dysfunction in these regions has been tied to a variety of motor and language deficits
including issues with motor initiation and sequencing, articulation, and sentence planning as well as speech
disorders including developmental stuttering. The SMA has been studied with respect to vocalization in non-
human primate models, but the functional role of the preSMA and SMA in language production can only be
explored in humans. While there are multiple motor and speech-critical cortical areas in the medial frontal wall,
this proposal hypothesizes that the preSMA and SMA have unique roles in both speech/language and motor
production, with the former involved in selection of action and the latter in sequencing of action. By hypothesis,
PreSMA is involved in selection of elements and sequences in language and motor functions, while SMA
sequencing of speech and motor programs (e.g. articulation). While these regions interact with different
subcortical and cortical regions, sequence vs. selection is a critical variable that distinguishes activation in
these regions in both language and motor tasks. Critically, we hypothesize that the same regions perform
selection (preSMA) and sequencing (SMA) in motor and language tasks. To answer this question, we will
utilize stereo EEG (SEEG) intracranial recording in chronically-implanted epilepsy patients (N=20) in
conjunction with neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. In Aim 1, we will investigate the relationship of
sequencing vs. selection in motor and language tasks (repetition vs. generation of sequences of finger taps
and syllables) to broadband gamma activity in the preSMA and SMA. We hypothesize that preSMA and SMA
will be activated in the selection (generation) condition for both motor and language tasks, while sequencing
(repetition) tasks that will activate only SMA. We will then investigate the connectivity of the preSMA/SMA to
understand how language-relevant information is transferred to this region for the purposes of speech
production. In Aim 2, we will first use SEEG cortico-cortical evoked potentials to show direct effective
connectivity between preSMA/SMA and language regions including speech motor cortex (output), inferior
frontal gyrus (phonologic selection), and posterior middle temporal gyrus (semantic selection). We will then use
SEEG functional connectivity to demonstrate that functional connectivity to language regions increases during
language tasks in comparison to motor tasks. The cross-disciplinary approach proposed here will tie the
functional neuroanatomy of preSMA/SMA to psycholinguistic analyses of expressive language. Translated into
clinical practice, our results will create a better understanding of speech disorders including stuttering, improve
functional brain mapping, and elucidate the mechanisms of language dysfunction in SMA syndrome."

Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists (e.g., fentanyl, oxycodone) are highly efficacious for the treatment of pain.
However, their therapeutic benefits are coupled with unwanted side effects like tolerance, respiratory depression,
and addiction, indicating the need for improved therapeutic options. Recently, fluorinated fentanyl analogues
(FFAs) have been produced which possessed a decreased pKa relative to fentanyl. This property allows these
novel MOR agonists to become selectively activated by the low pH microenvironment associated with injured
tissues while remining relatively inert systemically. Therefore, they should produce antinociception with efficacy
and potency like fentanyl while avoiding the unwanted effects of traditional MOR agonists (addiction, respiratory
depression.) However, literature regarding the abuse liability and respiratory depressing effects of these pH-
restricted ligands is limited. This fellowship proposes to rigorously compare FFAs to fentanyl in models of
antinociception, abuse potential, and respiratory depression in rats. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the anti-
nociceptive potency and efficacy of the test ligands across highly varied pain modalities. Aim 2 will evaluate the
potency and efficacy of the test ligands to produce abuse-related effects in self-administration. Finally, Aim 3 will
measure the potency and efficacy of the test ligands to produce respiratory depression using whole-body
plethysmography. Sex effects will also be investigated. Ultimately, the proposed research will provide critical
information regarding the safety margins of a new class of candidate opioid therapeutics. The results of this
investigation will contribute greatly to the search for safer, non-reinforcing, treatments for pain. This fellowship
training plan will encompass scientific training and professional development. To ensure proper preparation for
a career as a physician-scientist, special attention will be paid to integration of academic research with continued
exposure to clinical medicine. All aspects of this fellowship will be carried out at the Jackson campus of the
University of Mississippi Medical Center. The applicant will receive scientific training and professional
development from the Sponsor and Co-Sponsor, their collaborators, the Program In Neuroscience, and the
School of Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences."
10815530,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the worldwide leading cause of death, highlighting a critical need for
additional therapies beyond what is currently available. Furthermore, the dramatic rise in obesity and type 2
diabetes (T2D) threatens to derail progress in treatment of CAD over the last 50 years. Obesity causes insulin
resistance, which increases the risk of CAD both directly and indirectly, through the development of T2D and
through the associated abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome – dyslipidemia, hypertension, high waist-hip
ratio, and elevated glucose. There are few treatments available for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome
despite affecting nearly 30% of the US. Additionally, despite discovery of >200 genetic loci associated with
CAD and >320 loci associated with insulin resistance related metabolic traits, the translation of these genetic
insights into genetically driven therapies has been stagnated by the lack of understanding of the mechanistic
connection between of CAD and insulin resistance. This proposal aims to determine the mechanistic
connection of the gene PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16), which is associated with both CAD and insulin
resistance related metabolic traits, to atherosclerosis. PRDM16 is known to regulate insulin resistance through
regulation of brown and beige adipose tissue function. However, the role of PRDM16 in atherosclerosis is
unknown. PRDM16 is a promising causal gene in CAD due to its high expression in vascular tissues and
smooth muscle cells (SMCs); its high correlation with markers of SMC function; its interaction with other known
CAD loci; and its interaction with important CAD signaling pathways. The applicant’s central hypothesis is
that PRDM16 promotes CAD risk through epigenetic regulation of gene networks that modulate SMC
phenotype to promote atherosclerosis risk. The applicant’s primary sponsor, Dr. Tom Quertermous, has
developed a paradigm of SMC phenotypic modulation whereby SMCs de-differentiate, proliferate and migrate
in response to atherogenic stimuli. This paradigm was developed using high resolution single cell sequencing
technologies. Leveraging this platform, the application will test their hypothesis through two proposed aims. In
Aim 1, the applicant will determine the impact of Prdm16 on vascular SMC function in atherosclerosis. In Aim
2, the applicant will determine the impact of Prdm16 on SMC phenotypic modulation using single cell
sequencing technologies. The applicant will test these aims using a novel mouse model whereby Prdm16 is
deleted from SMCs as well as by using molecular perturbations of PRDM16 in complementary in-vitro
approaches. The proposed work will discover the causal role of PRDM16 in atherosclerosis and the
fundamental role of PRDM16 in vascular SMC biology. Additionally, this work will identify a novel pathway
connecting both CAD and insulin resistance, which will lay the foundation for discovery of novel therapies that
may treat both CAD and insulin resistance."
10897312,"This is an application for a cooperative agreement (U54), “Partnerships to Enhance Alcohol Research across
NCCU and UNC (PEAR-NC),” between faculties of North Carolina Central University (NCCU), a Historically
Black College or University, and the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies (BCAS) at the University of North
Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine. This proposal represents a true collaborative effort between the NCCU
and UNC faculty with both groups contributing significant effort and being essential to the success of this
Alcohol and Health Disparities program. Within this proposal, an NCCU Administrative Core and three
Research Components will integrate with the UNC-BCAS Administrative Research Components, as well as
other activities at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. The UNC NIAAA Alcohol Research Center (ARC) and
BCAS have many faculty studying mechanisms of alcohol pathology across the spectrum of behavioral, tissue,
and cellular pathologies that occur with alcohol exposure. This proposal will focus on cellular pathologies that
allow collaborative research partnerships on common areas of interest between UNC and NCCU faculty.
These partnerships open UNC research laboratories, core facilities, and medical libraries to NCCU faculty,
improving opportunities for developing productive research laboratories at NCCU. In addition, due to recent
NCCU NIAAA R awards, large numbers of NCCU students will continue to become involved in research on
mechanisms of alcohol pathology, providing education on African American alcohol-related health disparities
which are due to increased morbidity to alcohol-related pathologies and not increased alcohol use disorder.
The objective of this U54 partnership is to investigate molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced cellular
pathology. This proposal includes three NCCU research projects, involving six NCCU faculty, that will
investigate the molecular mechanisms of fetal alcohol pathology, alcohol-induced mammary stem cell toxicity,
and neuroimmune responses in adolescent and adult brain. A second objective is to provide research
experiences and scholarly education on alcohol pathology for NCCU students. The educational efforts in this
proposal will involve NCCU undergraduate and graduate students through the BCAS seminar series, through
training in UNC laboratories and research development and mentor meetings, attendance and presentation of
data at the annual RSA meeting, an alcohol seminar series hosted by NCCU, new course curricula on alcohol
pathology developed with a focus on health disparities, as well as specific undergraduate student summer
internships for NCCU students to study and learn about alcohol pathology and health disparities within
laboratories in both institutions. Ultimately, this proposal will conduct, promote, support, and mentor research
into mechanisms of alcohol pathology, creating an active and successful alcohol research program within
NCCU that synergizes with UNC to advance education and discoveries."
10767272,"Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community
and health care system. Machine learning (ML) methods have been crucial in detecting the disease and
characterizing its progression. Due to the lack of an in vivo “ground truth” diagnosis, ML approaches
have typically relied on clinically derived labels and a case-control design in their search for a single
imaging pattern that optimally distinguishes between the two groups in the case-control design.
However, heterogeneity within clinical labels may degrade performance and interpretability. The goal of
this project is to address this limitation and accurately characterize heterogeneity in preclinical and
symptomatic AD. Given that age is a major risk factor for developing dementia, we will characterize
healthy aging using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 1. To this end, we propose to develop
a novel unsupervised multi-view machine learning tool that can integrate information from multiple
imaging modalities (i.e., structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and amyloid and tau sensitive Positron
Emission Tomography) in a principled way. This will enable us to define the normal trajectory of age-
related changes across all modalities, providing the necessary context to understand AD pathology. We
will characterize AD pathology using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 2. To this end, we
propose to develop a novel semi-supervised ML framework that integrates multimodal information and
derives data-driven disease dimensions. This is achieved by identifying and quantifying at the individual
level imaging patterns that capture neuroanatomical and neuropathological alterations. Our approach
builds on our extensive prior work on using an advanced, unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis
technique, termed orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization, for analyzing neuroimaging
data. Importantly, our project leverages two large multimodal datasets, the Knight AD Research Center
(ADRC) cohort and AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which sample participants across the continuum
of AD making them ideal for investigating heterogeneity of AD pathology using advanced ML techniques.
If successful, our approaches could be used for studying any brain disorder and could be readily
integrated into personalized medicine strategies in the future when rich, multimodal imaging data
collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in hospitals."
10762970,"Diabetic gastroenteropathy includes asymptomatic delayed gastric emptying, dyspepsia with or without mildly
delayed gastric emptying, or gastroparesis, which is characterized by more severe symptoms and delayed
gastric emptying. Diabetic gastroparesis may also result in impaired glucose control, nutritional compromise,
anxiety and depression, and poor quality of life. Diabetic gastroenteropathy is often associated with nitrergic
neuropathy; and loss of nitrergic neurons due in part to repressed transcription of neuronal nitric oxide
synthase (Nos1) has been causally linked to gastroparesis. However, pharmacologically increasing nitric oxide
signaling is not beneficial due to gastric and systemic side effects; and compromised tissue microenvironment
in diabetes may limit the efficacy of transplantation of neurons. We have identified physiological hypoxia
(“physioxia”), which is pronounced in enteric neurons, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1A), a transcription
factor regulated by molecular oxygen sensor enzymes, as key factors of normal Nos1 expression and NOS1
protein levels. We have also found that HIF1A, in addition to stimulating RNA polymerase 2 pause-release,
increases Nos1 transcription by reconfiguring chromatin loops linking proximal Nos1 regulatory elements to
remote super-enhancers. How DM interferes with Nos1 transcription and epigenetic regulation and whether
these changes are reversible in vivo is unclear. We hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes
interferes with HIF1A-inducible Nos1 transcription via increased intracellular O2 levels that facilitate the
degradation of HIF1A by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes and block HIF1A-mediated transactivation by
upregulating the activity of HIF1AN (Specific Aim 1); via increased ratio of the tricarboxylic acid cycle
metabolites succinate:α-ketoglutarate that inhibits histone and DNA demethylases and upregulates repressive
chromatin (Specific Aim 2); and via reduced ATP synthesis, which impairs chromatin looping and reconfigures
enhancer–promoter interactions (Specific Aim 3). We will study these mechanisms in cultured and freshly
isolated, genetically labeled nitrergic neurons, mouse models and patient samples using epigenomic
techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and genome-wide chromosome conformation
capture, metabolomics, in-vivo analysis of intracellular O2 levels, RNA sequencing, Western blots, and
confocal microscopy. Mechanistic studies will rely on in-vitro RNA interference, conditional gene deletions in
mice, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome and epigenome editing in cells and mice. Pharmacological studies
will target molecular O2 sensors directly or indirectly including via mitochondrial targets in cultured cells and
mice, where gastric functions will be monitored by noninvasive functional assays. To facilitate translation of our
findings, we will validate key observations in human tissues and attempt to restore NOS1 levels and gastric
functions in mice using drugs with proven efficacy in humans. Linking diabetes-associated mitochondrial
dysfunction, hypoxic signaling and gastric functions will change how we think about diabetic gastroenteropathy."
10753516,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced
training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and adapting culturally-
sensitive interventions to reduce disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among ethnic minority
cancer patients and survivors. This K01 proposal seeks to culturally-adapt and test the feasibility of a writing-
based intervention, expressive helping, and its efficacy on psychological well-being, quality of life (QoL), and
cancer-related fatigue (CRF) among Chinese American cancer survivors. Expressive helping integrates two
distinct areas of research showing that expressive writing (i.e., a writing intervention that facilitates emotional
disclosure) and helping others (e.g., support giving) improves psychological well-being among healthy and
clinical populations. In expressive helping, participants write about their cancer experiences, disclosing their
emotions and providing encouragement and guidance, with the knowledge that their narratives will be shared
with and used as a resource for other cancer survivors. Aim 1 of the study is to conduct a qualitative study to
culturally adapt the expressive helping intervention for Chinese American cancer survivors. 24 In-depth
interviews and 3 focus group discussions with Chinese American cancer survivors and key informants will
inform the adaptation of the expressive helping intervention by focusing on material development and
recruitment, implementation, and retention strategies. In Aim 2, a mixed methods randomized controlled trial of
expressive helping will be conducted to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy on psychological well-being,
QoL, and CRF outcomes (N = 108). Participants will complete follow-up outcome questionnaires at 1-, 3-, and
6-month follow-ups. A subset of the participants (n = 20) will complete post-intervention qualitative interviews
to examine how writing may have influenced their psychosocial adjustment. The proposed study is well-suited
to the expertise the applicant brings to the project, and well-suited to be conducted in New York City (NYC), as
NYC has the largest Chinese population of any city outside of Asia. The K01 award will facilitate the applicant’s
transition from conducting basic research on culture and emotion regulation with healthy Asian Americans to
intervention research with minority cancer survivors. It will help build his long-term career goal in implementing
evidence-based interventions to reduce cancer health disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among
minority cancer survivors. As part of this award, the applicant will train in cancer survivorship, community-
based participatory research (CBPR), qualitative research, and mixed methods intervention research by
conducting the proposed study in collaboration with Drs. Chau Trinh-Shevrin (primary mentor), Qian Lu (co-
mentor), Jennifer Leng (co-mentor), Marjorie Kagawa-Singer (consultant), and Annette Stanton (consultant)."
10782451,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of serious metabolic abnormalities, such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Data obtained from studies conducted in humans and rodents have suggested that “metabolic inflexibility” is critically involved in the pathophysiology of such metabolic abnormalities. The mechanism(s) responsible for obesity-induced metabolic inflexibility is not clear but could involve altered metabolic activity in white adipose tissue (WAT). In the current funding cycle of this grant, we have focused on studying adipose tissue NAD+ biology and conducted a series of studies that demonstrate the causal relationship between defective WAT NAD+ metabolism and metabolic inflexibility. We found: 1) loss of NAMPT, a key NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme, impairs cellular insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, and adrenergic-stimulated lipolytic activity in WAT; 2) adipocyte-specific Nampt knockout (ANKO) mice have multi-organ (skeletal muscle, liver, WAT) insulin resistance, hypoadiponectinemia, impaired adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body energy metabolism, and impaired fuel selection to hypercaloric and hypocaloric challenges; 3) a novel molecular link between NAD+ metabolism and Caveolin-1 (CAV1), a key regulator of whole-body metabolic flexibility; 4) dietary restriction and exercise, well-known enhancers of metabolic flexibility, stimulate NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis in WAT; and 5) consistent with our rodent data, people with obesity have decreases in WAT NAMPT expression and NAD+ concentration. Based on these findings, this renewal application will test the hypotheses that NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis regulates CAV1 and mitochondrial function in WAT, key effectors of metabolic flexibility and glucose metabolism, and that defective WAT NAD+ metabolism is a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for obesity-induced metabolic inflexibility. In Aim 1, we propose to generate two novel mouse models, mice overexpressing NAMPT selectively in visceral WAT (using the novel AAV system) and tamoxifen-inducible ANKO (iANKO) mice, and evaluate metabolic responses to high-fat diet feeding and lifestyle modification (dietary restriction, exercise). In Aim 2, we propose to use in vitro systems and explore four mechanisms (lysine acetylation of CAV1, PPARG, sirtuins, and redox metabolism) that link NAD+ metabolism with CAV1 and mitochondrial function. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to determine the potential clinical relevance of the studies we conducted in the mouse model (Aim 1) and cell culture systems (Aim 2). Specifically, we will evaluate the effects of two potential “NAD+ enhancers”, namely lifestyle modification (low- calorie diet ± supervised exercise training) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation (250 mg/day, 8 weeks), on WAT NAD+ metabolism, CAV1, and mitochondrial biology in overweight people. The anticipated results obtained from this proposal will provide novel insight into the importance of adipose tissue NAD+ biology in regulating metabolic flexibility and glucose metabolism."
10764800,"The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a member of the family of ErbB receptors, which consist
of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region, a homologic cytoplasmic protein
tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal tail with multiple phosphorylation sites. EGFR can be activated by a
family of ligands (including EGF, TGF-a, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, epiregulin and betacellulin) that bind and induce
receptor autophosphorylation and activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Transactivation of the EGFR
receptor occurs by activation of ADAM-mediated cleavage and release of active EGFR ligands, with ADAM17
(TACE) mediating release of HB-EGF, amphiregulin, TGF-a and epiregulin. We and others have reported EGFR
to be a mediator of fibrosis in chronic progressive kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy, RPGN, chronic
allograft nephropathy and PKD. Either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR activation can be an effective
therapeutic intervention in experimental models of progressive kidney disease, but the mechanisms by which
EGFR activation mediates development of progressive chronic kidney injury are still incompletely understood.
 EGFR and its ligands are expressed in a variety of cell types including cells of myeloid origin. We and others
have defined an important role for myeloid derived cells in propagation of acute kidney injury and in the
development of chronic renal damage, but the role of renal myeloid cell EGFR and its ligands in progressive
kidney injury has not been previously studied. Our recent preliminary studies indicate that EGFR signaling is a
mediator of inflammatory macrophage actions in the kidney. As indicated in Preliminary Results, activation of
myeloid EGFR as well as expression of its ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), appear to play an important role in
post-ischemic renal injury and in development of progressive renal fibrosis. In addition, recent studies
demonstrate that iRhom2, an inactive member of the Rhomboid intramembrane proteinase family, mediates
myeloid cell-specific activation of TACE and secretion of amphiregulin and HB-EGF, as well as TNF-a
without affecting ligand release in other organs, raising the possibility that targeting iRhom2 could be a
potentially efficacious approach to limit development or progression of CKD.
 We propose to investigate the role of the renal myeloid EGFR axis in development of chronic renal fibrosis in
three specific aims:
Aim I Determine the role of EGFR in macrophage activation in kidney disease
Aim II Determine the role of amphiregulin in mediation of development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis with progressive
kidney injury
Aim III Determine the role of iRhom2 (Rhomboid 5 homolog 2 (RHBDF2)) activation in mediation of renal myeloid
cell-mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis"
10806938,"Despite clear scientific and relevance to public health, the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in schizophrenia
(SZ) are poorly understood. There is a critical need to identify mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneity as
current treatments are ineffective for the majority of patients. One source of heterogeneity is biological sex. Our
central hypothesis is that: (1) sex-differential symptoms in SZ arise from sex differences in specific neural
networks, and (2) these sex differences emerge as a consequence of pubertal influences during the critical
neurodevelopmental period of adolescence. The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (ABCD),
a 10-year longitudinal study following 11,875 9-10-year-olds into early adulthood, is uniquely capable of testing
this hypothesis. In response to this FOA, we propose to use ABCD baseline and follow up data years 1-6 to
examine sex and pubertal influences on adolescent development of two neural networks associated with sex
differences in SZ. We will assess task-based activation and connectivity in the frontal-limbic emotion regulation
and frontal-striatal reward processing networks using Emotional N-Back and Monetary Incentive Delay fMRI
task data respectively. We will also assess resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in each network. We will
test sex and pubertal influences on activation and connectivity in each network at ABCD baseline (Aim 1), as
well as associations between sex, puberty, and developmental trajectories of each network (Aim 2), and the
development of psychosis, negative valence, and positive valence system symptoms (Aim 3) from baseline (9-
10 years old) to Year 6 (15-16 years old). We will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1. Characterize sex
differences and effects of puberty markers on frontal-limbic and frontal-striatal networks at baseline as
measured by task-based fMRI and rsFC. We hypothesize variability in puberty markers (development,
hormones) relates to variability in frontal-limbic and frontal-striatal networks and that sex moderates these
relationships. 2. Test effects of sex and puberty markers on age-related changes in frontal-limbic and
frontal-striatal networks as measured by task-based fMRI and rsFC at baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow
up. We hypothesize age-related changes in puberty markers mediate developmental trajectories of these
networks and that sex moderates these relationships. 3. Determine if sex and/or puberty markers moderate
activation and connectivity of each network at baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow up in relation to
development of psychosis and symptoms related to negative and positive valence systems in years 1-
6. We predict sex and puberty markers will covary with frontal-limbic and frontal-striatal networks over time to
predict subsequent development of sex-differential symptoms in SZ. This work will determine sex and pubertal
modifiers of neurodevelopmental trajectories that contribute to the emergence of SZ, a major NIMH priority.
Results will answer critical questions about mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in SZ and will have a
substantial public health impact by advancing new sex-based precision medicine treatments."
10753553,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this research is to develop cardiac quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for non-invasive meas-
urement of blood oxygen saturation, towards the long-term objective of improving early diagnosis, therapeutic
decision-making, and clinical outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is a progressive and
life shortening disorder affecting ~10% of adults over age 65. Given that PH can be irreversible in its later stages,
early diagnosis and physiologic monitoring are critically important. Impaired oxygenation of the lungs and heart
chambers (cardiac oxygenation) is a key manifestation of PH that impacts symptoms and clinical outcomes.
Increased pulmonary arterial pressure in PH impairs pulmonary oxygen exchange, decreasing delivery of oxy-
genated blood to the left heart. Systemic cardiac output is often compromised in PH, resulting a larger differential
blood oxygen saturation between the left and right heart. Invasive catheterization (cath) is currently used to
measure cardiac oxygenation but entails procedural risks, ionizing radiation exposure, and is impractical for early
diagnosis and serial monitoring - a non-invasive method to accurately measure blood oxygenation would be of
substantial utility. MRI is well suited for PH assessment as it enables integrated evaluation of pulmonary anat-
omy, pressure, as well as cardiac function and remodeling - blood oxygenation is a key gap in MRI evaluation of
PH. This gap stems from limitations in current pulse sequence technology rather than fundamental MRI physics.
It is well known that deoxygenation changes the magnetic susceptibility of blood. These changes have tradition-
ally been probed using a magnitude property of the MR signal: the transverse relaxation time (T2). However, this
requires patient-specific calibration that is difficult in clinical practice. In contrast, QSM relies on the phase of the
MR signal to directly measure susceptibility and thus cardiac oxygenation. We have obtained highly encouraging
preliminary data for QSM measurement of cardiac blood oxygenation, with close agreement between QSM and
oxygenation measured invasively. We have identified key challenges for developing cardiac QSM, including
motion suppression and prolonged scan times. The current research proposes to develop an accelerated cardiac
QSM method, and to test QSM in relation to oxygenation on invasive cath, as well as effort tolerance and clinical
prognosis. Study Aims are as follows: (1) Develop accelerated cardiac QSM using free-breathing acquisition and
optimized reconstruction. (2) Test accelerated and current cardiac QSM among PH patients in comparison to
T2-based cardiac oxygenation and the reference standard of invasive cardiac catheterization. (3) Determine
whether cardiac QSM stratifies clinical severity and predicts PH disease progression. The expected outcome of
this research is a non-invasive method for measuring cardiac oxygenation – a critically important marker in PH
that currently relies on invasive testing. Given the increasing prevalence and therapeutic options for this serious
condition, non-invasive oxygenation assessment by cardiac QSM holds broad significance towards the goal of
early diagnosis, therapy optimization, and improved clinical outcomes for millions of patients with PH."

Program Advisory Committee (PAC), and executive decisions regarding Portland Alcohol Research Center
(PARC) activities are made by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee sets and continuously
evaluates progress toward general scientific research directions and oversees quality control mechanisms in
all areas of Center activity. For example, the Steering Committee played a significant role in synthesizing
Center research results in the development of our current hypotheses regarding the extracellular matrix (ECM)
and its role in circuit function underlying drinking behavior. Additionally, they identified synergies between
continuing and new projects. The PAC evaluated our findings at a convened local meeting and provided advice
with regard to proposed research. Newly appointed PAC members assisted in the review of written PARC

10757957,"Abstract P001
P001 is a continuation and expansion of currently funded Hitzemann PARC project. Dr. Richards Leads the
project as Dr Hitzemann (Co-I) transitions to retirement (1/1/2023). Dr. Ozburn (Co-I) provides resident
expertise in transcriptome analysis and testing of nominated ethanol consumption treatment targets using a
number of techniques. Previously published results from this project17,18, along with monkey transcriptome and
epigenetic findings (P003, P004), converged to focus the PARC application on the tetrapartite synapse. Use of
the heterogeneous stock-collaborative cross (HS-CC) mice continues as a unique aspect of P001. Advantages
of using the HS-CC, which capture 90% of mouse genetic diversity, are described in Hitzemann et al.39.
Residual individual variation in ethanol consumption that persists after selective breeding for high preference is
a new key focus. S.A.1. expands our analysis of the ethanol preference risk transcriptome from a network
perspective. Three key regions of the addiction circuit: prelimbic cortex (PL), nucleus accumbens core (NAcC),
and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), will be studied in short-term selectively bred high preference (HP)
and low preference (LP) lines from HS-CC founders. Further, because RNA-Seq from bulk tissue is a blunt
instrument for annotating the cell types associated with specific genes and network modules, single cell RNA-
Seq (scRNA-Seq) will be used for this purpose. Cognitive flexibility, identified in our PARC macaque studies as
a predictor of later ethanol consumption (see P004), will be measured in the HP and LP lines for P001 in C001.
Brains from these animals will be shared with P004 to track whether changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM),
a prominent feature of the tetrapartite synapse, are related to differences in risk for ethanol consumption and in
cognitive flexibility. S.A.2. is a new focus on transcriptional features associated with residual individual
variation in chronic ethanol consumption among members of the HP line. Transcriptional analysis will be
completed (P001) for the PL, NAcC and CeA, and integrated with analysis of DNA methylation in the PL and
NAcC in P003 for tissues from the same subset of higher and lower ethanol-consuming HP mice. Prior to
ethanol drinking, all individuals will be cognitively tested, so that cognitive flexibility can be examined as a
predictor phenotype for the entire distribution of mice, as well as for the extreme tails included in transcriptome
and DNA methylation analyses. S.A.3. derives from our current project and P003 indicating a role for the
primary cilium in ethanol preference. We will measure primary cilia number and length in mice with differential
risk for ethanol consumption (ethanol-naïve HP and LP mice), and after different amounts of chronic ethanol
intake (residual variation in HP). This aim also will study the importance of receptors and signaling molecules
found only in the primary cilium on ethanol consumption, and will study additional targets as they arise. P001 is
well integrated with the other Center components, all of which combine efforts to examine aspects of the
tetrapartite synapse and focus on genetic or epigenetic factors contributing to variation in ethanol consumption."
10757963,"PROJECT SUMMARY – P002
Several genome-wide studies, including studies from the previous funding period of the PARC, identified the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and astrocytes as being involved in both the risk for and the effects of ethanol
drinking. Cells in the brain parenchyma are separated by the extracellular space, accounting for approximately
20% of the total volume of the mature rodent brain and containing a highly organized ECM that forms an
insoluble network around cells. The brain interstitial ECM significantly contributes to the molecular signals
regulating neuronal plasticity. Recent research has shown that astrocytes are major producers of the brain
interstitial ECM as well as ECM proteases, which are involved in the remodeling of the ECM. ECM proteins are
post-translationally modified by glycosylation. Proteoglycans are major components of the brain ECM and
consist of a core protein covalently bound to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) formed by repeating disaccharides,
modified by sulfation. Hyaluronic acid (HA), also a major component of the ECM, is a non-sulfated GAG and is
not covalently bound to proteins. GAGs are involved in the modulation of neuronal plasticity. The overall goal
of this proposal is to identify differential expression of astrocyte-specific genes (with a major emphasis on
genes involved in the formation and remodeling of the ECM) and differential levels of ECM GAGs associated
with ethanol drinking in two brain regions involved in addiction: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; including
the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We plan to reach this overarching goal
by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Definition of the astrocyte translatome in the mPFC and NAc of
naïve and ethanol-drinking Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice; validation of differential translation and expression by
qPCR and by RNA scope, respectively, in Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice; determination of the expression of
selected ECM-related genes in ethanol naïve high ethanol preference (HP) and low ethanol preference (LP)
mice, and in ethanol-drinking HP mice by RNAscope. We will use the translating ribosome affinity purification
(TRAP) technology in Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice that express a modified ribosomal protein Rpl10a with an
eGFP tag (EGFP-Rpl10a) only in cells expressing the astrocytic marker Aldh1l1. Selected differentially
translated RNAs for ECM-related proteins will be confirmed by qPCR and their differential expression and sub-
regional localization will be determined by RNAscope. Differential expression of selected ECM-related genes
will also be determined in ethanol naïve HP vs. LP mice to investigate genes involved in the risk of ethanol
drinking and in drinking and naïve HP mice to investigate the effects of ethanol drinking in this selected line by
RNAscope. 2) Determination of chondroitin sulfate (CS)-, heparan sulfate (HS)-, and HA-GAG disaccharide
levels in the mPFC and NAc of ethanol naïve and ethanol-drinking Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a and HP mice and in
naïve LP mice. The proposed studies will characterize the role of astrocyte ECM and of sugar chains in the risk
and consequences of ethanol drinking and identify cellular and molecular targets for intervention."
10757964,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Although approximately 54% of Americans over the age of 18 consume alcohol, only 6.5% meet the criteria for
an alcohol use disorder (AUD). To date, there are three FDA approved medications to treat AUD, each having
varying efficacy on an individual basis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying circuit-specific
changes that lead to AUD is essential to developing novel, targeted, and effective treatments for AUD. In
advancement of this goal, we have begun to identify genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) signals within the
nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) that distinguish low and heavy ethanol drinking monkeys. A subset of these
differential DNAm (D-DNAm) signals were associated with the expression of genes that play a role in
modulating neurotransmission. In particular, we found D-DNAm signals in genes that are functionally
associated with different compartments of the tetrapartite synapse that includes pre- and postsynaptic
elements, astroglial processes, and the extracellular matrix. Glutamatergic inputs into the NAcC arise from
brain regions outside of the NAcC, including Brodmann area 32 (A32, in primates; prelimbic cortex (PL) in
rodents). By investigating A32 inputs into NAcC, we will begin to elucidate circuit-specific DNAm signals that
distinguish low from heavy/very heavy ethanol drinkers. We will use to advantage the highly relevant and well-
characterized nonhuman primate (NHP) alcohol drinking model in which rhesus macaques imbibe alcohol daily
for over 12 months and self-select into low and heavy drinkers. Genome-wide DNAm sequencing (GW-DNAm)
will be used to identify alcohol-dose associated differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and regions (DMRs)
in the A32 and NAcC. Using a combination of a neuron specific antibody (NeuN) with a fluorescent tag and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we will begin to elucidate cell specificity (i.e. neuron-specific) in the DNAm
signals of the NHP A32. In parallel, we will examine the DNAm state of these same NHP A32 targets using
amplicon bisulfite sequencing in PL in high-ethanol preference mice that have consumed alcohol for 3 months
and self-select into low and heavy drinkers. These studies will yield gene/regulatory regions as targets that are
highly correlated with ethanol dose, based on differences in consumption, conserved across species and play
a role in the tetrapartite synapse. Using engineered viral vectors that alter the expression, function or
methylation level of gene targets, we will perform a mouse functional assay that will test their role in ethanol
drinking (self-administration of ethanol for 3 months) and in the PL-NAcC circuit (tested using ex vivo slice
electrophysiology). The most efficacious targets from the mouse functional assay will be tested in ex vivo slices
obtained from chronic ethanol drinking NHPs for their ability to alter A32 and NAcC circuitry. In total, this work
will identify alcohol dose-dependent DNAm modifications that are specific to the A32/PL-NAcC circuit, and
provide functional support for the design of promising new AUD treatments."
10757965,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This is a renewal application to the P60-Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC). In the past funding
period we added key knowledge to our understanding of the predictive nature of corticostriatal circuitry and
cognitive flexibility in mediating risk for chronic heavy alcohol drinking in rhesus monkeys. The monkey model
has also provided evidence that chronic heavy drinking results in synaptic remodeling and an imbalance in
striatal output towards glutamatergic excitatory tone[1,2]. Finally, genomic data from the PFC and the nucleus
accumbens of heavy drinking monkeys (preliminary data) point to the extracellular matrix (ECM) component of
the “tetrapartite synapse”[3] in mediating excessive alcohol drinking and impaired cognitive flexible behavior. A
main constituent of the ECM related to synaptic function is the glycosaminoglycan Hyaluronic Acid (HA)[4,5].
Data supporting the importance of HA to the function of ECM in synaptic plasticity is expanding rapidly[6]. To
our knowledge, there are no studies that directly link ethanol-associated changes in HA synthesis and
metabolism to altered synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, our preliminary data show that ethanol leads to altered
expression of hyaluronidases, HA synthases and HA-binding proteins in support of the hypothesis that heavy
alcohol drinking alters HA metabolism in synaptic ECM and perineuronal nets (PNNs) to alter striatal neuronal
activity. Thus, this proposal seeks to provide pivotal information on HA as a target for ethanol-induced
adaptations to Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs), the projection neurons of the striatum. To determine the effect
of chronic drinking on HA composition and subsequent alterations in striatal MSN synaptic plasticity, we
propose a combination of molecular, histological and electrophysiological techniques. These findings will then
be placed into a larger framework of functional measures of corticostriatal circuitry involved in chronic heavy
alcohol drinking as mapped by fMRI (monkeys) and cognitive flexibility (mice and monkeys). We posit that this
circuitry, particularly corticostriatal loops conveying sensory-motor information, are involved in both the risk for
heavy alcohol drinking as well as the propagation of heavy drinking once it is established. We will use the
proposed research PARC cores and integrate these findings with the PARC projects to gain a deeper
understanding of other ECM constituents in chronic alcohol drinking. Overall, if successful, this project will
provide critical information establishing a link between HA-ECM content and ethanol-associated synaptic
adaptations within the sensorimotor corticostriatal circuitry that promote habitual (inflexible) behavior."

The inclusion of an Animal & Resource Core (C001) in this Center renewal reflects the emergent needs of a
research enterprise with an augmented focus on shared genetic mouse models and demands for integrated
behavioral phenotyping and high-throughput sequencing services. To address these requirements, C001 will 1)
establish and maintain colonies of genetic mouse models; 2) conduct standard operating procedures (SOPs)
for: short-term selective breeding based on level of ethanol preference, chronic ethanol consumption via a two-
bottle choice (2BC) procedure, and the evaluation of cognitive flexibility with a set-shifting procedure; and 3)
provide a streamlined process for the submission and processing of RNA/DNA samples for sequencing by the
Massively Parallel Sequencing Shared Resource (MPSSR) via the Sequencing Division of C001. Centralizing
these roles and responsibilities within C001 will relieve project investigators from the burden of developing
separate sets of resources and procedures, thereby providing greater latitude to address pertinent
experimental manipulations and perform cutting-edge analyses to address specific hypotheses. Animal &
Resource Core initiatives will offer multiple Center-wide advantages, including reduction of research costs
through an economy of scale, enhanced scientific rigor and experimental reproducibility through standardized
husbandry and colony maintenance practices, and implementation of optimized SOPs by dedicated staff in a
constant and controlled environment. C001 will collaborate with the Research Projects in the completion of four
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the Core will establish, maintain and distribute genetic mouse models to support the
Center Research Projects. The models are the Heterogeneous Stock Collaborative Cross (HS-CC) mice,
selectively bred mouse lines for high (HP) and low (LP) ethanol preference, and Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a
transgenic mice. In Aim 2, the Core will perform behavioral phenotyping services, including those SOPs
mentioned above, but also for traits that aid in the interpretation of significant effects of genomic and
pharmacological manipulations on ethanol drinking, such as tastant preference, locomotor activity, and ethanol
clearance. In Aim 3, a set-shifting procedure will be optimized in HS-CC mice that closely parallels cognitive
testing performed in rhesus macaques, thereby enhancing cross-species translation between Center projects.
This SOP will be used to perform studies for P001 in HP and LP mice that address the relationship of cognitive
flexibility with risk for ethanol intake and for P001 and P004 to address the dose-dependent consequences of
chronic ethanol intake. In Aim 4, the Sequencing Division of the Animal & Resource Core will perform next-
generation sequencing services for all Research Projects, and will work in conjunction with the Bioinformatics
Core (C002) for the alignment and analysis of RNA-seq and genome-wide DNAm-seq data."
10757967,"Bioinformatics Core Summary/Abstract
The Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC) research projects will generate large amounts of gene
expression and epigenetic data from multiple species and treatment conditions. The Bioinformatics Core
(C002) will play an integral role in the management and analysis of these data, enabling the identification of
genomic markers of alcohol exposure and risk for alcohol abuse. The key functions of C002 will be to provide
foundational analyses to enable the primary endpoints within each project, provide higher-order inference by
integrating data across PARC projects, and to augment these analyses by integration of PARC data with
publicly available data resources.
C002 will work with PARC investigators to design, troubleshoot, and execute best-practices computational
analysis pipelines appropriate for the primary endpoints for each project.The core's experimental design and
analysis services include: 1) Bioinformatics such as DNA- and RNA-seq read alignment, differential
expression and pathway analysis, methylation and epigenetic analyses, data integration, and custom script
writing; and 2) Biostatistics such as biomarker, longitudinal, survival, and high-throughput/high-dimensional
omics analysis. Services under these two categories are often integrated during a given study. Each analysis is
customized to best fit the needs of the project and investigator.
Furthermore, C002 will augment individual PARC projects by bespoke integration of big data resources
available in the public domain. C002 will download and organize available single-cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq) data from relevant mouse brain regions, creating an atlas of cell type-specific expression that can
be used for fine-mapping the cell types driving differential expression patterns observed in P001 and P002.
Likewise, C002 will host publicly available epigenetic information from human and mouse, which will allow
expression and methylation in P001, P002, P003 and P004 to be annotated and contextualized with a much
larger set of genomic annotations (e.g. ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc). Finally, C002 will perform cross-project
integration by searching for signals that may be shared across species, first by assessing for common gene
sets or pathways identified in mouse and macaque experiments, and, as a final translational step, assessing
the convergence of PARC-based insights with the vast amount of human genetics data emerging on Alcohol
Use Disorder."

The Information Dissemination Core CD001 proposes three interrelated specific aims designed to advance
NIAAA's mission of translating and disseminating research findings to health care providers, researchers,
policymakers and the public. All of the Core's activities are targeted especially to under-represented minorities
and/or other disadvantaged groups. Specific Aim 1: K-12 Education & Outreach. The principal goal is to
provide K-12th grade students and their teachers with information about alcohol, the brain, and neuroscience.
We propose age-appropriate activities that present information about how the brain works and how alcohol can
affect it. The activities promote keeping one's brain safe, making informed choices, meeting male and female
neuroscientist role models from diverse backgrounds, and pursuing careers in neuroscience and alcohol
research in particular. Aim 1 focuses especially on adolescent vulnerability to alcohol abuse by utilizing
material from the NIAAA curriculum, Understanding Alcohol: Investigations into Biology and Behavior, and from
other sources. New for the renewal, we propose to prepare high school students to make presentations in their
school's respective feeder middle schools. We will initially partner with Portland Public School's Benson
Polytechnic High School health careers program in order to bring more diverse and disadvantaged students
into health science research and clinical practice. The high school students will discuss with their middle school
near-peers the changing adolescent brain and how to transition successfully to high school. We propose to
continue a novel neuroscience and safety curriculum developed by this Core for Kindergarten-3rd graders, with
more advanced activities to be added for 4th and 5th graders. At the high school level we continue a Genetics
and Alcohol seminar that is adaptable from lab visits to in-school classroom visits to auditorium talks, and an
interactive sports team seminar focusing on the effects of alcohol on athletic training, performance, and
recovery. A new 3-module curriculum on biological responses to alcohol is proposed for high school health
professions students. Specific Aim 2: Training in Alcohol Research. Here, we propose to provide training
and laboratory experience in alcohol research to high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral
students. Training the next generations of alcohol researchers has been a major commitment of many PARC
investigators, some for over 30 years. Specific Aim 3: Dissemination and Translational Interface. In this
Aim we propose to coordinate and share the findings of the Center, and alcohol research results in general,
through a variety of well-established mechanisms with scientific colleagues, policymakers, and diverse
communities. Aim 3 proposes activities and resources including: professional and lay publications; the Center
website for professionals and the general public; the PARC Library; inclusion of PARC investigators in the
University's speakers and scientific experts bureau; dissemination of PARC findings to the media; professional
conferences; and outcome review of the education and outreach activities of the Core."
10782977,"The corticospinal tract (CST) is the most important voluntary motor control system in humans.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) irreversibly damages the CST, which leads to loss of voluntary motor
control below the injury, including hand function that is critical for independent daily life for
quadriplegia. Recently we have made great progress in achieving substantial CST regeneration
after SCI using spinal cord neural stem cell or progenitor cell grafts. However, an expected and
important finding recently emerged from our RR&D-funded studies: only hindlimb CST axons
regenerate into grafts placed into sites of cervical SCI; forelimb CST axons rarely regenerate.
These findings raise the hypothesis that enhancing regeneration of forelimb CST axons will
significantly improve functional outcomes after SCI when combined with neural stem cell grafts.
In the renewal of this grant, we propose to elucidate mechanisms underlying the poor
regenerative capacity of the forelimb CST and to test experimental approaches for enhancing
forelimb CST regeneration that we hypothesize will further improve forelimb functional recovery
after SCI. Specific Aim 1: Use RNA Sequencing to identify molecular mechanisms associated
with differences in forelimb-CST and hindlimb-CST axonal regeneration in rats. Understanding
mechanisms why forelimb CST does not regenerate is important to help us designing
experiments to enhance forelimb CST regeneration. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether
transient blockade of forelimb CST synaptic activity enables forelimb CST regeneration. Our
recently study showed that forelimb CST axon is highly collateralized in the brain, but hindlimb
CST does not. We hypothesize that these extensive collaterals and their synaptic connections
of forelimb CST limit their regeneration. Recent studies support this hypothesis since deletion
or suppression of Cacna2d2 gene that involve in synaptic activity promotes axon regeneration.
Specific Aim 3: Explore whether PTEN/SOCS3 deletion or suppression will increase forelimb
CST regeneration and skilled forelimb function recovery. In the previous period of this RR&D
grant we found that PTEN/SOCS3 conditional deletion significantly increased overall CST
regeneration into a stem cell graft after SCI, but we did not separately label forelimb and
hindlimb CST axons. We will determine whether PTEN/SOCS3 genetic deletion or suppression
by antisense oligonucleotide therapy specifically enhances forelimb CST regeneration as an
alternative mechanism.
All studies proposed are supported by preliminary feasibility data and can be conducted by the
PI and his collaborators who have extensive experience in SCI research field. Positive findings
of this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of central nervous system regeneration
mechanisms, and identify paths forward to developing treatments for human SCI."

As we enter into an era of personalized (precision) medicine, it becomes increasingly important to define the
factors that confer disease risk and outcome. Since these determinants cannot be easily controlled in human
epidemiological studies, genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) strains and human induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) lines provide mechanistically-tractable platforms to define the factors underlying disease heterogeneity
and translate them to risk assessment tools and treatments. This challenge is nicely illustrated by
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a rare neurogenetic condition caused by a germline mutation in the NF1 gene.
Individuals with NF1 are prone to the development of a wide variety of neurological problems, including
cognitive and behavioral problems (60-70% of children) and low-grade brain tumors (~20% of children). While
establishing the diagnosis of NF1 in an infant is straightforward, it is currently not possible to predict which
child will develop future medical problems, determine whether there will be clinical progression requiring
treatment, or institute effective therapies that specifically target the subtype of clinical manifestation in that
individual. The pressing challenge for clinicians and researchers alike is to dissect the genetic, cellular,
molecular, and systems-level etiologies for these common neurologic problems with the ultimate goal
of developing prognostic and precision neurology approaches for children affected with NF1. In this
proposal, we plan to leverage human NF1-patient iPSCs, mice engineered with patient germline NF1 gene
mutations, bioinformatics and systems biology approaches, and novel modeling approaches to mechanistically
define the factors that underlie the heterogeneity that characterizes NF1. The overall mission of this project is
to establish the etiologic bases for NF1 clinical variability and to create a blueprint for future clinical application
necessary to transform the care of individuals with NF1 from a reactive to a more proactive approach."
10744254,"Project Summary
The prevailing doctrine that messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in higher organisms encode for a single protein has
undergone a dramatic revision in recent years. Ribosome and proteomic profiling have revealed a large number
of small translated open reading frames (ORF) within previously described “untranslated regions” (UTRs) and
long non-coding RNAs. Indeed, some of the peptides derived from small ORFs have been implicated in various
fundamental processes (e.g., development). Translation of small ORFs in the 5’UTR, known as upstream-ORFs
(uORFs), has been shown to have a profound regulatory effect on gene regulation, independent of the encoded
peptide. Further, translation of uORFs vary under pathologic conditions such as cancer, and mutations affecting
uORFs are associated with various human diseases. We and others have also indicated the existence of
translated small ORFs in the 3’UTR known as downstream open reading frames (dORFs) in human cells and
zebrafish embryos. However, contrary to uORFs, there has been no systematic study of dORF functions, and
their relationship to human health and disease remains untested. Further, given their location in the 3’UTR, the
molecular mechanism by which dORFs engage the translational machinery remain completely unknown.
Our long-term goal is to understand how post-transcriptional regulation (mRNA half-life and translation) shapes
gene expression in vertebrates, and its impact on human disease. The central hypothesis of this application is
that translation of dORFs regulates gene expression. Our preliminary data strongly indicate that, contrary to
uORFs, dORFs strongly enhance translation of the canonical ORF and emerge as an uncharacterized
and potent regulatory mechanism across vertebrates. The objectives are to: 1) Identify factors involved in
enhancing translation of the main ORF. 2) Dissect the regulatory information driving dORF translation, and 3)
Characterize the biological impacts of dORF-mediated regulation. The rationale for the proposed research is to
gain a mechanistic understanding of dORF-mediated regulation in order to assess the possible biological
importance of dORF dysregulation under stress or disease conditions. This proposal is conceptually innovative
as it is based on the exploration of a novel, yet widespread and potent translation regulatory mechanism
conserved across vertebrates. Technically, this proposal will combine genomic profiles (RNA-seq, Ribosome
profiling); reporter (cytometry); biochemistry tools: RNA pulldowns follow by proteomics, CRISPR-Cas-9 and -
12a (to edit) and our novel Cas13d tool (knock-down in embryos); combining human cell and zebrafish embryos.
The outcomes from this project will help understand how dORFs are translated, shape gene expression and
generate phenotypes. This novel function of the ribosome adds to the recently emerging regulatory effects of
translation on gene expression (e.g. uORF, codon optimality). Understanding dORF biology will provide an entry
point and perhaps even a diagnostic tool to associate mutations with human diseases. Identifying the molecular
machinery involved in this pathway might provide targets for therapeutic interventions."

 The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a homeostatic enzymatic cascade that tags defective or unwanted
cellular proteins with ubiquitin, resulting in their efficient proteasomal degradation. Protein quality control is critical
to cancer cell survival due to the heightened demands of cell proliferation and the damage sustained to the
cancer cell proteome from a host of stresses. Multiple myeloma is a classic example of a human cancer
exquisitely dependent on the proteasome due to massive overproduction of antibody proteins and is thus
susceptible to proteasome inhibition by bortezomib. FDA approval of bortezomib heralded the development of
multiple approaches to modulate the UPS for therapeutic benefit by targeting the E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin transfer
enzymes and deubiquitinases. UBE1 is the most apical enzyme of the ubiquitination cascade and is singularly
responsible for 99% of ubiquitin charging of E2 proteins. The small molecule TAK-243 was developed to target
the ATP binding pocket of UBE1 and forms a covalent adduct with the C-terminus of ubiquitin, resulting in arrest
of enzymatic activity. TAK-243 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in vitro, in mouse models, and in a small phase
1 trial, underscoring the potential of blocking UBE1 as an anti-cancer strategy. However, point mutagenesis at
the TAK-243 binding site can cause resistance, mandating alternative approaches to targeting UBE1 in cancer.
Examination of the structures of E1/E2 complexes revealed a surface groove on E1 bound by the N-terminal a-
1 helix of E2 (E2h1), suggesting that an a-helical mimic of E2h1 could be developed as a potential UBE1 inhibitor.
Natural motifs such as E2h1 often unfold when taken out of context of the native protein, resulting in loss of
bioactive shape and rapid proteolytic degradation. Peptide stapling reinforces the natural a-helical shape of
bioactive peptides and confers stabilized structure, protease resistance in vivo, enhanced target binding affinity,
and favorable pharmacology. Applying this technology to UBE1 targeting, the Walensky lab recently generated
a prototype inhibitor using the E2h1 sequence of UBE2A. The stapled peptide bound to the UBE1 surface groove
and blocked ubiquitin transfer to E2 proteins, resulting in suppression of protein ubiquitination in vitro. Here, I
propose to combine our stapled peptide approach to drug development and our recent discovery of a targetable
helix-in-groove interaction on UBE1 to advance a unique treatment strategy for human leukemias. Specifically,
I aim to (1) design, synthesize, and characterize novel stapled peptide inhibitors of E1 (SPIEs) that target a helix-
in-groove interface between E1 and E2 proteins; (2) define the conformational consequences of E1 targeting by
SPIEs and the structure of a lead SPIE/E1 complex; and (3) advance lead SPIEs to testing in UPS-dependent
leukemia cells to evaluate mechanism of action and anti-cancer efficacy. I am excited to pursue the proposed
training program for my chemical biology graduate studies in the laboratory of Dr. Loren Walensky at the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, and look forward to developing as a creative, independent,
and innovative physician-scientist at the forefront of cancer drug discovery and cancer care."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis driven by enhanced free fatty
acid (FFA) uptake and lipid synthesis with reduced lipid clearance through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and
lipoprotein export. Excessive hepatic lipid accumulation can cause lipotoxicity, which promotes local
inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis. This process leads to the development of nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), that can further progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma if left
unchecked. Current treatments for NAFLD/NASH seek to either reduce hepatic steatosis or diminish the fibrosis
response that drives NASH development. While these treatments have shown great promise in pre-clinical trials,
they have yet to provide a clear therapeutic benefit.
The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the largest family in the mammalian genome, interact with Eph
receptor-interacting (ephrin) ligands on adjacent cells to mediate cell adhesion/repulsion signaling during axonal
guidance, tissue patterning, leukocyte homing, and metastasis. Differential ligand-dependent and ligand-
independent phosphorylation events appear to mediate these often-inverse functions of EphA2 signaling. EphA2
interactions with ephrinA1 on an adjacent cell promote tyrosine autophosphorylation (Y588, Y772) and intrinsic
kinase activity, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and migration. In the absence of ligand, EphA2 can
become phosphorylated on S897, classically by Akt, resulting in enhanced proliferation and migration through
largely unknown mechanisms. Work from our lab demonstrated EphA2 expression in multiple cell types and
EphA2 deletion reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our preliminary data show that EphA2 knockout mice
show significantly reduced liver weight/body weight ratios following high fat diet feeding associated with
diminished hepatosteatosis and reduced inflammation. Furthermore, C57Bl/6J mice treated with a high fat diet
for 8 weeks show enhanced expression of the EphA2 ligand ephrinA1, along with enhanced markers of EphA2
ligand-dependent signaling. In contrast, both NASH patients and mouse models of NASH show decreased
ephrinA1 expression and enhanced markers of EphA2 ligand-independent signaling. Therefore, we
hypothesize that ligand-dependent EphA2 signaling serves as an initial protective mechanism in early
NAFLD that weakens as the disease progresses. Using a combination of cell culture and mouse models,
we will determine the role of EphA2/EphrinA1 expression and signaling in lipid homeostasis and metabolism
(Aim 1), and determine the role of EphA2/EphrinA1 expression and signaling in NAFLD/NASH progression (Aim
2). If successful, these studies will elucidate a novel role for EphA2 signaling in NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis and
may provide a novel therapeutic target to reduce liver damage in NAFLD/NASH."
10912491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet
they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and
recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority
population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among
underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach.
Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment
techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported
clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse
populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a
custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal
to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to
patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the
portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline
information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to
CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of
Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research
Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville,
Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants
representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs
associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for
dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research
Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to
quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase
I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center
Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and
(Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in
an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can
easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting
diverse participants to CCTs."
10895497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severely debilitating disease with no cure. Morphometric
studies revealed that the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with robust structural
remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries, characterized by thickening of the endothelial and smooth muscle
cell layers and formation of occlusive lesions. In addition to increased proliferation and migration of vascular
cells, failure of appropriate apoptosis (i.e., apoptotic resistance) contributes to remodeling via lack of cell
turnover. Our laboratory identified a new candidate as a regulator of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell
(PASMC) function: aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are a family of proteins that form transmembrane channels
which facilitate the transport of water into and out of cells. We have evidence that aquaporin 1 (AQP1), the first
family member identified, is expressed in PASMCs and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs),
upregulated in a rat model of PAH and modulates susceptibility to apoptosis. Our preliminary data also indicate
that increased AQP1 protein is associated with elevated β-catenin expression, a protein that regulates
migratory, proliferative and survival responses. The mechanism by which AQP1 regulates β-catenin levels is
currently unknown; we have generated exciting data indicating a critical role for a specific region of the AQP1
C-terminal tail. This region contains a previously unrecognized putative binding site for GSK3β, an endogenous
regulator of β-catenin abundance. Based on these data, we hypothesize that in PAH PASMCs and PMVECs,
increased AQP1 levels contribute to cell growth and survival by sequestering GSK3β and reducing its
activity/nuclear localization; as a consequence, β-catenin accumulates, promoting migration and proliferation
and preventing apoptosis. The Aims of this study are to: 1) determine whether AQP1 regulates β-catenin via
binding to GSK3β; 2) identify the mechanism by which AQP1 facilitates cell growth and survival; and 3)
evaluate whether cell-specific disruption of AQP1 prevents or reverses PAH."
10756987,"Multi-drug resistant bacteria present an increasing problem in US hospitals. To design new antibiotics that
are effective against these bacteria, it is important to understand drug-target interactions and the targets
themselves. We will study a major antibiotic target: the ribosome. Many ribosome antibiotics interfere with
the process of decoding by the ribosome (""tRNA selection""). The rate-limiting step of decoding is
accommodation, where the tRNA moves from a partially bound state (A/T state) to its fully bound position
(A/A state) inside the ribosome. Structural biology techniques have determined the structure of the
ribosome before and after accommodation. Kinetic experiments have determined accommodation rates. It
is difficult, however, to study the process of accommodation in atomic detail experimentally and the
detailed effects of antibiotics. While molecular dynamics simulations have been used to characterize
spontaneous transitions in smaller protein complexes, the large size and complexity of the ribosome have
made similar studies of the ribosome computationally prohibitive. In our preliminary data, we have
combined the high performance computing resources at Los Alamos National Laboratory with all-atom
reduced-model potentials to study accommodation of tRNA into the ribosome. Here, we will use large-
scale molecular simulation to study key features of accommodation and the effects of antibiotics. We will
closely integrate molecular dynamics with single molecule studies to form a more coherent picture of
ribosome decoding."
10760242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Goals: Peri-Centromeric Heterochromatin (PCH) is required for genome stability/DNA repair, chromosome
pairing, nuclear architecture, and transposon and gene silencing. Previous studies suggested that histone H3
lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me2/3), Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) binding, HP1-interacting protein
recruitment and chromatin compaction are sufficient to explain PCH formation and function. In 2017, my lab
and the Narlikar lab published complementary studies suggesting that 3D PCH domains form via liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS), generating membrane-less condensates with an immobile HP1a core surrounded by
a liquid. We proposed that novel properties associated with highly networked, phase separated systems (e.g.
liquidity) are critical to understand how PCH, and other chromatin domains, form and regulate essential nuclear
functions. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the organization, dynamics and
biophysical/material properties of PCH components and condensates in a cellular and organismal context. In
addition, we need to determine if and how biophysical properties regulate genome functions such as repair,
replication and transcription, a current major challenge for the whole field of condensate biology.
 Approach: This MIRA will interrogate how LLPS and biophysical properties impact the in vivo organization
and function of heterochromatin and other associated nuclear bodies. We will capitalize on our preliminary
results and knowledge of PCH biology, combined with advanced imaging, biochemical, and experimental and
theoretical biophysical approaches, to elucidate 1) the molecular interactions responsible for PCH domain
formation; 2) the architectural, biophysical and chemical properties of the domain; and 3) whether or not phase
separation and liquidity regulate PCH functions and interplay with other nuclear bodies.
 Innovation: Although LLPS and biological condensates have become a popular topic for study and
discussion in recent years, we know little about in vivo mechanisms and relevance to function in the complex
but important cellular and organismal contexts. This is an emerging field, with unique challenges, and an
interdisciplinary approach is required to address these key questions. Thus in this MIRA proposal we will
combine our decades of experience in PCH biology with the expertise of collaborators in experimental and
theoretical biophysics, and advanced bioimaging. Testing our hypothesis will elucidate important information
about the organization and function of heterochromatin in cells and animals, potentially providing a paradigm-
shifting foundation for understanding how chromatin domains in general form and function.
 Health Relatedness: Defective PCH causes genome instability and altered gene expression, contributing
to cancer, birth defects, and aging. Understanding how biophysical properties that underlie PCH formation and
function are altered in human diseases will likely result in novel approaches to diagnosis and treatment."

Loss of cardiomyocytes by apoptosis and/or necrosis is a hallmark of cardiac ischemic injury, pathological
remodeling, and end-stage heart failure. Although necrosis was traditionally regarded as a passive and
unregulated process, emerging evidence has shifted this paradigm and identified several forms of “programmed
necrosis”, including death receptor-mediated necrosis (termed “necroptosis”), mitochondria-mediated necrosis,
and other regulated necrotic processes. Despite recent progress, how necroptosis is regulated in the heart
remain largely unknown and preventing necroptotic cardiomyocyte death is still an important challenge. Our pilot
studies identified a new K63-linked polyubiquitination (K63-Ub) dependent necroptosis signaling network that
critically regulates cardiac ischemic injury and pathological remodeling. Intriguingly, the K63-deubiquitinase
CYLD (cylindromatosis) was markedly up-regulated, whereas the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF2 (TNF receptor
associated factor-2) was down-regulated, in the heart after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our preliminary results
further identified CYLD and TRAF2 as an activator and a suppressor of myocardial necroptosis, respectively.
Importantly, cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of CYLD attenuated ischemic injury and adverse remodeling by
inhibiting necroptosis. Acute deletion of TRAF2 in the adult heart caused dilated cardiomyopathy by promoting
necroptosis, whereas TRAF2 gene transfer elicited cardioprotection. Mechanistically, we propose a new K63-
Ub dependent necroptotic regulatory mechanism whereby CYLD deubiquitinates TRAF2 and TAK1, disrupts
TAK1-RIP1 interaction, and promotes the necroptotic complex. As an opposing mechanism, TRAF2 acts as an
E3 ligase for TAK1 to inhibit necroptosis signaling. Thus, the reversible K63-Ub (mainly non-proteolytic)
constitutes a new paradigm of necroptosis signaling with important biological implications. We hypothesize
that the deubiquitinase CYLD, in conjunction with the E3 ligase TRAF2, critically regulate myocardial necroptosis,
ischemic injury, and remodeling, thus representing promising therapeutic targets. Aim 1 will investigate the
opposing roles of K63-Ub modifying enzymes CYLD and TRAF2 in regulating myocardial necroptosis and
ischemic injury in vivo. Aim 2 will define a CYLD/TRAF2 mediated, K63-Ub dependent necroptosis signaling
network in cardiomyocytes. Using genetic and molecular strategies, we will investigate the opposing roles of
CYLD and TRAF2 in regulating myocardial necroptosis under basal conditions and in the setting of ischemic
injury. The proposed studies will provide new insights into the molecular regulation and functional significance
of necroptosis in the heart, which has important translational implications, especially given our preliminary results
revealing CYLD/TRAF2 as key necroptotic regulators and promising targets for ischemic heart disease."

The molecular mechanisms that explain the potent anti-diabetic effects of bariatric surgery remain elusive. The
rapid nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remission after surgery have led to the suggestion that unidentified
small molecules are responsible. For sleeve gastrectomy (SG), the most common bariatric operation performed
today, knockout mouse studies have shown that bile acid receptors are critical for surgery’s metabolic benefits.
The key ligand(s) that are changed post-SG to engage these bile acid receptors is unknown. Work from our
laboratory has identified a bile acid metabolite, cholic acid 7-sulfate (CA7S), that is induced in the intestine by
SG. We have found that CA7S is a potent TGR5 agonist that improves glucose handling in diabetic mice, and
the production of CA7S occurs in the liver by sulfation of cholic acid in response to the gut microbial product,
lithocholic acid (LCA), that signals via the hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR). Our long-term goal is to understand
and replicate less invasively the anti-diabetic mechanisms of bariatric surgery. The overall objective of this
application is to define the anti-diabetic properties of CA7S, the microbiome-dependent mechanisms of CA7S
production, and CA7S contribution to T2D remission following SG. Our central hypothesis is that CA7S is
produced in response to gut microbial metabolites and improves T2D following SG via intestinal TGR5 activation.
We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of long-term
CA7S administration on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and weight in diet induced obese (DIO) mice and
TGR5 deficient mice to understand the global metabolic effects of CA7S and sustained intestinal TGR5
activation. In Aim 2, we will determine how the microbiome induces CA7S production by (1) quantifying LCA-
producing Clostridia bacterial species and expression of LCA-producing enzymes post-SG in mice and humans,
and (2) generating DIO mice with and without intestinal LCA and assessing their metabolic phenotype and
response to SG. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of CA7S in T2D improvement post-SG. We will perform
SG in VDR deficient mice, which lack endogenous CA7S, or in mice with knockdown of SULT2A1, the key
enzyme responsible for CA7S production. We will reconstitute CA7S by exogenous replacement in CA7S
deficient animals to determine the contribution of CA7S to surgical improvements in glucose metabolism. This
work will characterize the effects of a natural, gut-restricted TGR5 agonist, CA7S, on T2D and lay the foundation
for its translation as a therapeutic. By characterizing specific metabolite-receptor interactions within the intestine,
portal vein, and liver, we will define a novel, microbiome-dependent, gut-liver signaling pathway that explains
improvement in glucose metabolism after SG. This work will significantly advance our molecular understanding
of the causal mechanisms of bariatric surgery and identify multiple novel targets for the treatment of T2D."
10747907,"The focus of the studies funded by this award over the past two decades has been on the response of
oligodendrocytes to inflammation. This work is of critical relevance to the immune-mediated demyelinating
disorder multiple sclerosis, which is characterized by CNS inflammation, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination
and axonal degeneration. Our studies have shown that oligodendrocytes respond to inflammation by activating
the integrated stress response (ISR), which is a highly conserved, cytoprotective response that initiates with the
phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). We have demonstrated using
genetic models that oligodendrocytes with a diminished capacity to phosphorylate eIF2α in response to stress
display increased susceptibility to inflammatory insults and that prolonging the phosphorylated state of eIF2α in
oligodendrocytes increases their resistance to inflammation, both in vitro and in mouse models of inflammatory
demyelination. This work has provided the foundation for an effort to protect oligodendrocytes from inflammation
by pharmacologically enhancing the ISR. In contrast, recent reports indicate that that the inhibition of the ISR
pathway provides protection in certain neurological disorders. Moreover, our unpublished work indicates that
oligodendrocytes experiencing ER stress activate a distinct cytoprotective response from oligodendrocytes
challenged by mediators of inflammation. The studies described in the current proposal are designed to uncover
the molecular origin of this dichotomy. In aim 1 we will carry out a detailed characterization of the oligodendroglial
stress response in Jimpy mutant mice, which represent a mouse model of the human leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-
Merzbacher disease. Jimpy oligodendrocytes experience severe ER stress, and our preliminary data indicates
that inhibiting ISR activation in these animals provides significant protection to oligodendrocytes. In aim 2 we will
directly compare the various aspects of the response of oligodendrocytes experiencing ER stress with
oligodendrocytes exposed to inflammation. Aims 3 and 4 will be devoted to an effort to determine if the activation
of non-canonical cytoprotective responses explain the differential response of oligodendrocytes to ER stress and
inflammation. In aim 3 will examine the contribution of NRF2, which is phosphorylated by the stress-sensing
kinase PERK, to these responses. In aim 4 we will examine a recently discovered ER stress response pathway
that is triggered by the cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 2 (TMEM2), which is of potential relevance to
myelinating and remyelinating oligodendrocytes. Together the work described in this proposal will significantly
advance our understanding of the response of oligodendrocytes to various cytotoxic insults, which will provide
important information critical to the development of neuroprotective therapies for oligodendrocytes and other
cells of the nervous system."
10758793,"Asthma remains a major public health issue worldwide, affecting all ages and ethnicities, with 50% of patients
experiencing inadequate control of the disease. Constricted airways from contraction of airway smooth muscle
is the major cause of airflow obstruction, and morbidity and mortality, in asthma. Despite this key point for
intervention, only one class of direct bronchodilators (-agonists) are available for treatment, and they are
suboptimal for many patients. We have discovered bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) on human airway smooth
muscle (HASM) cells which signal by a unique mechanism. When activated, TAS2Rs markedly relax HASM and
relieve airway obstruction that is otherwise resistant to -agonists. However, the known TAS2R agonists have
low affinity and evoke desensitization (tachyphylaxis) of the relaxation response over time via -arrestin
mechanisms. The overarching hypothesis is that TAS2R agonists with novel structures can be highly effective
in relaxing airways in an asthmatic milieu and yet not evoke tachyphylaxis. The broad long-term objectives are
to determine the 3D structures and binding sites of two TAS2Rs expressed on HASM (R5 and R14) and then
use these structures to perform virtual docking of an agnostic ultra-large compound library to identify potential
ligands. These hits will be examined in engineered model cells, but will be most intensely studied within the
context of the physiology of HASM cells, and human airways, under asthmatic conditions to delineate novel ways
to engage the receptor that are biased towards relaxation and away from desensitization. Aim 1 will
computationally determine the structures and binding sites for R5 and R14 using methods that include 13 trillion
combinations of the residues to determine favorable energy conformations of inactive and active states. The
structures will be used to dock compounds from a highly diverse library. These will be studied in Aim 2 to
determine potency and efficacy in genetically engineered model cells and in HASM cells from nonasthmatic and
asthmatic lungs. In Aim 3, the most favorable compounds will be studied to ascertain -arrestin engagement
and biasing away from desensitization in model cells, HASM cells, and human lungs under asthmatic conditions.
Results from Aims2/3 will be fed back into Aim1 to further refine a model of biased agonists for these HASM
TAS2Rs. Based on our preliminary data that support all three Aims, we will learn about the structural
requirements for biasing for these receptors. And, we anticipate that multiple highly effective agonists with
unexpected structures will be identified and that their bronchodilating properties in asthma will represent a new
class of powerful non-desensitizing agents for treating and preventing bronchospasm."

Human dopamine signaling pathway induces and facilitates dopamine neurotransmission through the
mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, which modifies reward-related behaviors and is associated with the
development of many diseases, including schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, cognitive disorders and
Parkinson’s disease. Mounting evidence suggests that this important signaling pathway is constructively
regulated by the dopamine receptors (DRs). Thus, making members of this membrane protein family highly
promising therapeutic targets as supported by both pre-clinical and clinical studies.
Although some agonists of receptors in the human DR (hDR) family members (e.g. for dopamine D1-like
receptors) are being intensively studied for therapeutic intervention, their success has been greatly hampered
due to poor adherence and efficacy, or due to associated side effects. Relatedly, the polypharmacology of
dopamine D1-like receptor and other hDRs have been discovered in recent studies. New knowledge based on
structures of D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R) will not only reveal their signaling mechanisms, but also provide
new understanding that can be exploited to facilitate rational drug design.
hDRs belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family which is notorious for difficulties in generating
diffraction-quality crystals that are essential for the determination of high-resolution structures by X-ray
crystallography. This R&D proposal aims to develop a comprehensive and robust platform for structural and
functional studies of dopamine D1-like receptors and complexes of hDRs with G proteins, for screening high-
affinity nanobodies, antibodies, and ligands targeting these receptors. This platform will involve multiple steps
that are closely interconnected and looped through a forward and backward feedback system. The PI has now
also established strong collaborations with other research groups with different expertise as alternative
approaches, including X-ray free electron laser, Microcrystal Electron Diffraction technique, etc.
Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Structure/function studies of human D1R (hD1R) in the inactive state, (2)
Using X-ray crystallography and computational biology approaches to study the putative active state of hD1R,
and (3) Establishing optimized approaches for determining the structure of complexes of hD1R with G protein
partners using EM imaging. The significance of this study is multi-fold on dopamine signaling pathway and
related drug discovery studies: 1) we will gain insights into dopamine D1-like receptor functionalities and
allosteric modulations, 2) we will be able to screen extensively to identify new high-affinity ligands for hDRs, 3)
characterize the mechanisms of DR signaling and ligand selection between different dopamine receptor
subfamilies, 4) stimulate hDR structure-based drug design, 5) examine hDRs/G protein complex signaling and
reveal the activation mechanism, and 6) pave the road for the application of cryoEM technology on difficult
membrane protein targets in the future."

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to
society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased
~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and
nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction
which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm,
recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led
to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with
cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great
unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that
could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The
premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can
predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory
molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral
Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that
gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
 R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort
of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls.
Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that
distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific
Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and
which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support
Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best
predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months.
Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision.
R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their
peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine
(SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have
mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.
 Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or
prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In
addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop
DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials."

Trauma is the most common cause of death in people under the age of 45 in the United States and
costs more than $400 billion annually for medical care and lost productivity. The demand for trauma
and surgical critical care workforce in the US has never been higher and a severe shortage of
surgeons in this field is looming. The need for academic trauma and critical care practitioners that
can not only treat patients, but have the necessary skills to conduct basic, translational, and clinical
research to advance our knowledge and develop new treatments is even greater. The fundamental
purpose of this training program is to provide surgical residents and pediatric critical care medicine
fellows with an intensive two-year research training experience that will prepare them for an academic
career in trauma and critical care. Our training program has evolved over the past 29 years into a
highly structured and collaborative program that involves participants from multiple clinical and basic
science disciplines. Our trainees benefit from a team-based mentorship philosophy, outstanding
institutional support, and a broad range of educational opportunities. The training program is
designed to teach surgical residents, pediatric critical care fellows, and conventional PhD
postdoctoral fellows to assess a trauma-related problem, identify the key questions, formulate
hypotheses, and then design and conduct the appropriate experiments to test the hypotheses and
answer the questions."
10744189,"Project Summary
Conserved Non-protein coding Elements (CNEs) are <1kb DNA elements deeply conserved across vertebrate
genomes from zebrafish to human. While their role is not fully understood, they are prime candidates for cis-
regulatory function and can act as enhancers. As some have been implicated in human biology and diseases,
we developed a method to identify CNEs harboring risk SNPs identified in GWAS. Our method focused on
CNE/SNPs regions deeply conserved across vertebrate genomes that also preserve gene synteny in their
neighborhood to pinpoint potential cis regulated genes. Based on GWAS replications, we selected 20 CNE/SNPs
pairs and their syntenic genes potentially contributing to 5 human traits (sleep/circadian activity, skin
pigmentation, cardiovascular system, eye biology, body size and morphology) that can be modeled in zebrafish.
Independent and in depth in vivo characterization of two CNEs (1 and 19) showed that (i) human CNE specific
transcriptional enhancer activity can be revealed in live zebrafish, (ii) the risk SNP abolishes this activity, (iii) the
genuine cis-regulated gene associated to the human trait can be discovered, and (iv) the underpinning human
biology can be identified and studied by modeling the genetic defect in zebrafish. Based on these successful
validations and the exciting promise of shedding light on the molecular and cellular biology underpinning human
biological traits, we propose to test the central hypothesis that deeply conserved non-coding SNPs are regulatory
genetic variants responsible for differences in gene expression and function that affect human health. This
hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the transcriptional activity of the
remaining 18 conserved human CNEs and associated risk SNPs in vivo, and establish the mRNA patterns of
the 34 syntenic neighbor genes. Among the latters, Aim 2 will identify the actual cis-regulated genes via
systematic CRISPR/Cas9 editing of CNEs and mRNA (dys)regulation analysis. Finally, Aim 3 will identify the
genetic and biological consequences of disrupting CNEs (deletion, introduction of risk SNP) and their cis-
regulated genes (indels). Aim 1 will use transgenesis in zebrafish to demonstrate that human CNEs are
enhancers whose functions are disrupted by the risk SNPs. Aim 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing
in zebrafish to delete all 18 CNEs (DCNE) or introduce risk SNPs in the zebrafish genome (CNE*) to identify the
syntenic neighbor genes that are cis-(dys)regulated. Aim 3 will compare the consequences of enhancer mutants
(DCNE, CNE*) with cis-regulated gene mutants to uncover the mechanisms underpinning the human biology
and traits. The approach of using high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in zebrafish to
uncover the functional relevance of human CNE/SNPs is innovative. The proposed research is expected to be
significant because it will establish the functional impact of non-coding genetic variants in human traits/diseases
and will shed light on the associated human biology with in vivo genetic modeling in zebrafish."

Candidate and Career Development: Dr. Taylor is a pediatric hepatologist and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics
at Northwestern University. She has maintained a strong interest in basic science and translational research
throughout her early career. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist
with a focus on the immunology of pediatric cholestatic liver disease. This K08 proposal will help achieve this
goal through the following specific objectives: 1) develop Dr. Taylor’s scientific and professional skills in
advanced immunology and bioinformatics, and 2) define the pathogenic macrophage (M) subsets in biliary
atresia (BA) to ultimately develop cell subset-specific treatment strategies. Dr. Taylor and her co-mentors, Dr.
Perlman and Dr. Green, have developed a detailed strategy to achieve these objectives through carefully
planned course work, didactics, laboratory techniques, and collaborations at Northwestern. The current proposal
will lay the foundation for future R01-level proposals on M-driven regulation of adaptive immunity in BA.
Research Plan: BA is a cholestatic liver disease of infancy that is the leading cause of pediatric liver
transplantation. BA is thought to arise from an aberrant immune response to an environmental trigger, however,
the exact mechanism of disease progression remains unknown. Evidence points to a central role for M in BA
pathogenesis, however, M are a heterogeneous and plastic cell population, and prior studies have not
distinguished between subsets. We are the first to demonstrate the M heterogeneity in pediatric cholestatic
liver disease through single-cell RNA sequencing and identified 3 distinct cholestatic liver M subsets: lipid
associated M, monocyte-like M, and adaptive M. Among these, adaptive M demonstrated increased
expression of genes involved in lymphocyte activation and greater disease-specific differences between BA and
a non-immune etiology of cholestasis. These findings suggest that adaptive M may be the pathogenic subset
in BA through stimulation of the T cell immune response known to play a role in BA. In the current proposal we
will build upon this Preliminary Data and investigate the hypothesis that adaptive M drive the pathogenicity of
BA through recruitment of inflammatory M and T cells. To evaluate this hypothesis we have formulated the
following two interrelated Specific Aims: 1) determine whether the novel lipid-associated, monocyte-like, and
adaptive M in human BA correlate with transplant-free survival, and 2) determine whether the adaptive M in
human BA are essential for the disease mechanism of murine BA. Through parallel studies in human and murine
BA, as well as comparison to an innovative non-immune murine model of neonatal bile duct ligation, we will
identify the BA-specific M subsets that drive immune injury. Results obtained upon completion of these aims
may identify new therapeutic targets for M immune modulation in BA to prolong transplant-free survival."
10754858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long-term memory impairment significantly impacts patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but no targeted
treatment exists. There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms that disrupt long-term information stor-
age in the epileptic brain. The long-term goal is to develop strategies to ameliorate and prevent cognitive impair-
ment in patients with epilepsy. The overall objectives are to i) elucidate how interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs)
affect hippocampal-cortical communication during memory consolidation, and ii) determine how closed-loop
modulation of this communication alters long-term memory in an animal model of TLE. The central hypothesis
is that IEDs disrupt the interaction of hippocampal ripples and cortical sleep spindles, altering neural activity
patterns and plasticity. Further, restoration of physiologic hippocampal-cortical coupling can normalize the long-
term memory deficits observed in TLE. The rationale for this project is that elucidating the spatiotemporally spe-
cific network mechanisms that underlie long-term memory disruption will enable prevention of pathologic com-
munication without impairment of physiologic communication, thereby facilitating memory consolidation. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims in a TLE animal model: i) evaluate the effect of
modulating hippocampal-cortical oscillatory coupling on neural spiking patterns; ii) determine the effect of mod-
ulating hippocampal-cortical coupling on long-term memory, iii) establish links between large-scale molecular
markers of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-cortical oscillatory coupling during impaired memory consolida-
tion. To accomplish these aims, in vivo electrophysiology and assays of immediate early gene expression will
be paired with closed-loop electrical stimulation in freely behaving rats performing long-term memory tasks. The
research proposed is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on modulating neuronal commu-
nication between brain regions during the interictal period to enhance memory consolidation. These contributions
will be significant because they are expected to provide the mechanistic groundwork for development of novel
approaches to treat, and potentially prevent, memory impairment in patients with epilepsy."

Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, primarily due to M. avium complex (MAC), is an increasing
clinical problem nationwide and now overtakes domestic TB in terms of morbidity and mortality. It is also
harder to treat and results in poorer outcomes despite longer drug regimens. In this context NIH issued a
notice AI-17-016 to request applications for NTM diseases. Here we present a proposal from the University of
Virginia, with collaborators at the Virginia Department of Health and Virginia Tech, that addresses many of the
needs that were cited. First, we will perform whole genome sequencing of MAC isolates from all of our state's
MAC lung disease patients to discern relapse versus reinfection and the environmental sources of acquisition.
Second we will utilize a state-wide cohort of new MAC lung disease patients to correlate clinical outcomes with
MAC species, drug susceptibility, serum drug levels, and biofilm bioassay. Innovation includes the use of a
state-wide epidemiological cohort, exquisite resolution with extensive preliminary data of whole genome
sequencing to discern species and mixed infections, a comprehensive state-wide serum drug monitoring
program (as we have done already for TB), and expertise in molecular diagnostics and genotypic-phenotypic
correlations. In sum, for this most vexing clinical problem of MAC lung disease we bring to bear extensive
preliminary data, unique expertise, innovative technology, cohesive collaborations, and synergistic aims."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disorder that afflicts 29% of Americans in their lifetime1,2,
is disabling2 and increases mortality3. New drug targets and neurobiological insight for AUD are needed.
Compulsive drinking putatively involves a transition to dorsal (vs. ventral) striatal control over drinking and a
relative underactivity of indirect pathway MSNs (iMSNs) that enable adaptive behavioral selection in contrast to
overactive direct pathway MSNs (dMSNs) that drive drinking behaviors. Compulsive drinking also involves a
shift to dorsal (caudate-putamen) from ventromedial (nucleus accumbens) striatal control of ethanol-related
behavior. Guided by novel preliminary data, this multidisciplinary project tests the overarching hypothesis that
decreasing dorsal striatal phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) type 2 activity in indirect medium spiny neurons
(MSN) reduces compulsive drinking. In 4 Specific Aims, we seek to fill molecular, circuitry, pharmacological,
behavioral and human genetic gaps in our understanding of the role of PDE10A isoforms in activation of
distinct striatal MSN pathways and compulsive drinking. Aim 1 seeks to identify translatable PDE10A
inhibitors that reduce compulsive-like ethanol self-administration, with consideration of enzyme off-rate,
lipophilic efficiency and neuroactivational effects on distinct MSN circuits. Aim 2 will intersect Adora2a-Cre
rats with expression of a floxed, validiated PDE10A shRNA to knockdown dorsal iMSN PDE10A in order to
determine this the role of caudate-putamen PDE10A in iMSNs in escalated and aversion-resistant self-
administration. Aim 3 seeks to determine the causal role of the striatal-restricted, membrane-associated
PDE10A2 isoform in compulsive-like ethanol intake. Finally, Aim 4 seeks PDE10A gene variants that
associate with problematic alcohol use as well as their functional, expression, and psychiatric genetic
correlates. The collective work of our assembled, multidisciplinary collaborative team will shed light on the
neurobiological and genetic role of PDE10A isoforms in distinct striatal circuits and compulsive drinking
behaviors as well as the potential impact of novel translatable PDE10A inhibitors to treat AUD."
10763794,"Abstract: In order for the brain to develop with proper size and structure, neural stem cells (NSCs) at early
ages must make proliferative divisions and maintain their stemness to expand the stem cell pool, but then
switch to undergo neurogenic divisions at the correct time to create neurons. However, the mechanism of
this fate choice from remaining an NSC early on, to later choosing to exit the cell cycle and become a
neuron, is still poorly understood. The last step of cell division is abscission, which severs the daughter from
the mother cell. Abscission occurs during the time when the fate decision is made, and at the apical
membrane, where many fate signals are located. We developed methods and tools to quantitatively analyze
abscission in cortical NSCs, in vivo and in vitro. We found that abscission is not simply necessary to cut cells
apart and keep them alive. Rather, we made the surprising discovery that both abscission duration and
remnants of abscission (midbody remnants) are developmentally regulated, changing as development
proceeds. Furthermore, we found that a small-brained mouse mutant with altered abscission duration has a
reduced proportion of proliferative NSC divisions. These data led to our central hypothesis that changes in
abscission duration and midbody remnant persistence can shift NSC daughter cells fate choices as
development proceeds. We will test this hypothesis through the use of innovative genetic and cell biological
approaches, on single NSC divisions and whole tissue analyses. We will utilize two mouse mutants that
perturb abscission specifically, affecting duration and midbody remnants differentially. We will carry out three
Specific Aims: 1) test whether abscission duration is correlated with daughter cell fate outcomes in vitro, 2)
dissect the primary and secondary effects of dysregulated abscission on cortical NSC daughter cell fates,
morphologies and lineage progression in vivo, and 3) investigate a candidate signaling mechanism at the
apical membrane that could link abscission regulation to stem cell maintenance. The contributions of the
proposed research will be to increase understanding of the fundamental question of how stem cells in
developing tissues maintain high proliferative capacity early and then reduce it later in favor of differentiated
daughter cell types. It will also elucidate how regulation of NSC divisions affect daughter cell fates,
structures, and subsequent divisions. These contributions will be significant because they will reveal novel
mechanisms and gene pathways that regulate how brain size and structure are controlled, and will elucidate
how specific alterations in NSC division mechanisms during development can lead to brain malformations, or
other neurodevelopment phenotypes."
10866550,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rearrangement of NUP98 gene (NUP98-r) is recurrent in leukemias such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Patients with NUP98-r show poor prognosis and therapy failure. Most NUP98-r partners (>30 identified from
patients) are a DNA-binding domain of transcription factor (TF; e.g. HOXA9) or a histone-binding motif such as
Plant Homeodomain (PHD), suggesting chromatin deregulation as an oncogenic mechanism. NUP98-r fusions
invariably retain Phenylalanine-Glycine (FG) repeats, termed intrinsically disordered region (IDR), from NUP98.
How unstructured IDR contributes to oncogenesis remains elusive. Our studies of NUP98-HOXA9, an AML
NUP98-TF chimera, unveil an essential requirement of NUP98’s IDR for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).
We also show that IDR and LLPS are critical for the much-enhanced genome binding by NUP98-HOXA9 and
for long-distance chromatin looping between oncogene promoters and enhancers, leading to development of
aggressive AML in mice. Our unpublished preliminary studies of other recurrent leukemic fusions (namely,
NUP98-PHD fusions and MSI2-HOXA9, a leukemia-related chimera formed by fusing a less-studied IDR of an
RNA-binding protein with HOXA9’s DNA-binding domain) all point to involvements of IDR and LLPS for
oncogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that, due to aberrant genic fusions, a number of leukemia-related onco-
TFs and chromatin factors acquire a phase-separation-inducing IDR to establish LLPS, which confers chimera
a much more enhanced ability in genomic targeting; consequently, an oncogenic gene-expression program is
over-activated while aberrant chromatin loops are formed between oncogene promoters and enhancers, which
drives formation of aggressive leukemias. Dissection of the mechanisms underlying the IDR- and phase-
separation-mediated aberrant genome organization and oncogene activation in cancer cells shall provide new
and paradigm-shifting views as for how aggressive cancer develops, implicative of potentially new treatments
in future. Towards this goal, we will further characterize the role for the un-studied IDR (that of MSI2) in
establishing LLPS in vitro and in cells (Aim 1A) and will use primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells (HSPCs) and derived cells to define roles of IDR and LLPS in regulating genomic targeting (1B), the
target gene expression (1C), and leukemic transformation in vitro/vivo (1D) by various fusions (NUP98-PHD
and MSI2/NUP98-HOXA9). LLPS-indued chromatin looping is CTCF-independent and represents a previously
unstudied mechanism underlying 3D chromatin organization. We will further define the 3D chromatin structure
alterations caused by various NUP98-r and MSI2-HOXA9 fusions in disease-relevant cells (Aim 2A), define the
molecular mechanisms driving formation/maintenance of LLPS-dependent loops (2B), and determine the
impact of LLPS DNA loops on the sustained activation of oncogenes by using a novel CRISPR/dCas9-IDR
fusion strategy (2C). As phase-separation-competent molecules are frequently implicated in a wide range of
human cancers and diseases, both the significance and overall impact of the project are potentially high."
11134978,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Back pain (BP), including low back and neck pain, is one of the most prevalent and disabling
pain disorders. Most cases remain poorly managed and known socio-ecological factors that pose barriers to equitable care
have been especially under-addressed resulting in critical disparities in BP management. This is evidenced by Black and
Hispanic Americans, and individuals with less education and income, consistently experiencing poorer outcomes.
Importantly, BP, like other chronic conditions, requires ongoing self-management. Unfortunately, most care offered
through health systems fails to support sufferers’ self-care, and instead focuses on costly and provider-dependent therapies
with little supporting research evidence. The persistent use of these practices contradicts evidence-based BP guideline
recommendations for less invasive complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches which can support self-care.
Importantly, our team has demonstrated CIH approaches can be safely and effectively delivered in non-clinical settings in
both in person and video-conferencing formats which can overcome barriers contributing to disparities.
The long-term objective is to bolster the widespread implementation of evidence-based CIH approaches that support
whole person oriented, self-care for individuals with back pain and who are from populations that experience health
disparities (BP-PEHD). We will use a two-phase project that applies established models and frameworks for facilitating
long term sustainability to develop, feasibility test, and evaluate the effectiveness of a community supported CIH self-
management program, Partners4Pain compared to an active control, Keys to Wellbeing. This project builds upon our
team’s extensive background in BP and CIH self-management research and established partnerships with community and
health organizations with broad and diverse reach including the YMCA, YWCA, and others.
Phase I (R61) will involve planning and preparations leading to a randomized feasibility study (n=40) including co-
development and assessment of Partners4Pain, a self-management program comprised of evidence based CIH approaches
(e.g. pain education, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral/pain coping strategies, exercise).
Phase II (R33) includes a full-scale multi-level randomized hybrid effectiveness implementation trial (n=376) of the
community supported self-management program, Partners4Pain compared to the active control, Keys to Wellbeing, both
of which will have been optimized and feasibility tested in Phase I.
By co-developing scalable evidence based CIH interventions with community stakeholders that can be delivered in an
accessible manner by community partner organizations with extensive reach, we will remove an important barrier that
currently exists within the costly and burdensome health care systems. This approach has the potential for larger scale
implementation across a range of community-based organizations and settings, improving equitable access to resources
that will support BP sufferers’ ability to gain greater agency in their own pain care, leading to better health and wellbeing."
10675480,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Limb malformations are the second most common congenital abnormality, occurring in 1 in every 500
live births. Mounting evidence implicates rare noncoding mutations to underlie non-syndromic (isolated) limb
malformations. Many of these variants map to transcriptional enhancers, regions of regulatory DNA that tune
gene expression. However, a fundamental gap remains in our understanding of the mechanisms by which these
variants alter enhancer activity and their role in causing limb defects. The most frequently affected noncoding
loci is the limb-specific enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). With over 30 independent rare variants linked to limb
malformations, the Shh limb enhancer is particularly susceptible to so-called Gain-Of-Function (GOF) variants.
GOF variants cause enhancer overactivity that leads to ectopic expression of their target genes. However, why
GOF variants only cause ectopic gene expression in specific cell types and why only a small subset of
enhancers are susceptible to GOF variants are both unknown.
 GOF variants are among the least understood enhancer mutations that cause human disease. Much of
our lack of understanding of how GOF variants contribute to disease is owed to a lack of suitable model systems.
In vitro cell culture and organoid-based systems fail to recapitulate ectopic expression from GOF variants nor
model their phenotypic consequences. Thus, it is essential to use in vivo systems to determine the functional
and clinical significance of GOF variants. To address this major need, our group recently developed a novel
mouse enhancer reporter assay that enables highly-reproducible detection of ectopic gene expression in the
cells of the anterior limb domain where Shh is normally not expressed. The overall goal of this proposal is to
determine the genetic factors mediating the unique susceptibility of anterior limb bud cells and the Shh limb
enhancer to GOF variants.
I will test the hypothesis that susceptibility to GOF variants is dictated by the regulatory landscape of
anterior limb bud cells and a unique, stable higher-order chromatin structure of the Shh locus. To identify the
genetic factors that mediate ectopic Shh expression, I will characterize the regulatory landscapes and local
chromatin architecture of anterior limb bud cells in which Shh is ectopically active at single-cell resolution. To
determine genetic factors that predispose specific enhancers to pathogenesis, I will test the requirement of
higher-order chromatin structure for limb malformations resulting from GOF variants. By identifying targetable
genetic factors mediating ectopic gene expression, these studies will provide mechanistic insights into how GOF
variants in the limb-specific Shh enhancer contribute to limb malformations. Findings resulting from this proposal
can also be applied to predict the clinical significance of noncoding variants from patient sequencing data and
will have implications for other developmental disorders linked to GOF variants."

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune neuroinflammation disease inflicting millions of
people worldwide. It is caused by dysregulated adaptive and innate immunity. CD4 T cells critically contribute
to MS development in humans and EAE development in mice. Particularly, Th17 cells are central to
autoimmune neuroinflammation. To understand the etiology of and develop treatment for MS, one of the main
goals of MS research is to understand how T cell and Th17 cell function are controlled. Transforming growth
factor–β (TGF-β) is instrumental in Th17 cell differentiation and function. Yet it is unclear whether and how
TGF-β superfamily member other than TGF-β controls Th17 cell differentiation in MS/EAE.
 Our recent findings revealed novel TGF-β superfamily and related signaling to regulate Th17 cell
function and the development of autoimmune neuroinflammation: (1) SKI protein, a TGF-β signaling
suppressor that is degraded upon TGF-β stimulation, suppresses Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo,
(2) SKI expression in T cells completely protected mice from EAE, (3) Activin-A, a TGF-β superfamily member
that is closely related to TGF-β, was upregulated during EAE and in activated T cells in inflamed tissues and in
the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, and (4) Activin-A+IL6 induced SKI degradation and the
differentiation of Th17 cells that phenotypically resemble pathogenic- rather than non-pathogenic-Th17 cells to
promote EAE. We therefore hypothesize that TGF-β superfamily member Activin-A is a novel factor distinct
from TGF-β to promote pathogenic Th17 function and autoimmune neuroinflammation through SKI. In this
study, we proposed to reach the following three Aims. AIM 1: Address whether Activin-A is required for Th17
cell function and EAE. AIM 2: Reveal the molecular program of Activin-A induced Th17 cell generation and
function; AIM 3: Investigate the mechanisms underlying SKI controlled Th17 cell function and EAE.
 There is a great and yet unmet need in the understanding of how Th17 cell function during autoimmune
neuroinflammation. This study aims to reveal previous unappreciated cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying TGF-β superfamily signaling in controlling Th17 cell differentiation and function for autoimmunity.
The success of this study will gain critical mechanistic insights into T cell mediated autoimmune
neuroinflammation and shed new light on how to mitigate related disease by targeting TGF-β superfamily
signaling pathways."
10704554,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The transition to parenthood is a period of profound transformation and often vulnerability in new
parents. Though most of the research on this transition has focused on mothers, new fathers must also adapt
to parenthood. Many parents experience sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality, which may increase mental
health risks of new parents and reduce the quality of caregiving behavior. Prior work in non-parent samples
suggests that sleep quality may be linked to the structural connectivity of the brain, as measured within white
matter microstructure (WMM). Less efficient connectivity of WMM has also been associated with mental health
problems. This project will examine postpartum sleep quality in first-time fathers and test associations with their
postpartum mental health and WMM. The project also examines postpartum WMM as a mediator between
sleep quality and mental health symptoms during the transition to parenthood. This project draws from an
existing longitudinal study of first-time parents followed from the prenatal to postpartum periods that
incorporated neuroimaging.
 Study aims are to: (1) Examine how postpartum sleep quality, controlling for prenatal sleep quality,
affects psychological adjustment to parenthood in new fathers; (2) Investigate whether sleep quality is
associated with postpartum white matter microstructure (WMM) among first-time fathers; (3) Examine the
mediating role of postpartum WMM on the relationship between postpartum sleep quality and fathers’
adjustment to parenthood. Study findings can provide insight into the role of sleep on the paternal brain and
mental health and inform interventions facilitating the adjustment to parenthood. The proposed project will
support the applicant’s training in biobehavioral research methods to become an interdisciplinary health and
family studies researcher."
10752618,"Background: The MISSION Act of 2018 further expanded the opportunity for Veterans to receive care in
the community. While this may have led to improved access to care, it may also have resulted in decreases in
the quality of care that Veterans receive.
 Significance: This study will be the first to improve existing risk adjustment methods used by VA with an
application for VA/Community Care (CC) quality comparisons. As increasing numbers of Veteran enrollees use
CC, there is an urgent need to know if the quality of care delivered in the community that is purchased by VA is
at least equivalent to the quality of care delivered in VA. We will also examine whether adding social
determinants of health (SDOH) to the risk adjustment methods impacts assessments of quality and health
disparities.
 Innovation and Impact: A better understanding of which new data sources and SDOH variables improve
risk adjustment methods is needed to enable fairer and more accurate comparisons of VA/CC quality at both
the national and local area levels. We will obtain a much richer picture of the conditions and other individual-
and community-level factors that affect the risk or disease burden of Veterans by also including data from
multi-system use (Medicare and All-Payer Claims Databases).
 Specific Aims: For federal fiscal years 2020-2022, our specific aims are to: 1) Examine whether adding
readily available VA, CC, and pharmacy data and individual- and community-level SDOH variables improve the
discrimination and calibration of Gagne (an easily modifiable comorbidity measure); 2) Examine whether
adding non-VA system use improves the discrimination and calibration of Gagne; and 3) Compare overall
VA/CC quality at the national and local area levels using “Gagne1” (which includes additional VA and SDOH
data), “Gagne2” (which includes non-VA system use datasets), and the Nosos risk score (an “off-the-shelf” VA
risk adjustment method). We selected two Veteran subgroups to study: Veterans with serious mental illness
(SMI) and Veterans undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). Both of these subgroups are in
high-cost, high-volume categories of outsourced CC. Quality of care is defined by 4 health outcomes:
emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions for Veterans with SMI, and complications and
readmissions after THA/TKA.
 Methodology: For Aim 1, we will examine the extent to which the coefficients on the Gagne comorbidities
change when additional data sources (CC and pharmacy data) are added to VA utilization data and then when
SDOH variables are added to predict outcomes. We will also compare discrimination and calibration between
Gagne, Gagne1, and Nosos. For Aim 2, we will examine the effect of adding non-VA system use data to
Gagne1 and evaluate their effect on model discrimination and calibration of Gagne2. For Aim 3, we will
compare overall VA/CC quality at the national and local levels using Gagne1, Gagne2, and Nosos.
 Next Steps/Implementation: Through collaboration with key operational partners (the Office of Community
Care [OCC], Analytics and Performance Integration [API], Office of Health Equity [OHE], Access Office, and
Serious Mental Illness Research and Evaluation Center [SMITREC]), we will provide VA leaders and
policymakers with equitable comparisons of quality that can be integrated into ongoing development of tools
and initiatives that are being implemented nationwide or used to help facilitate practice (which risk adjuster to
use) and policy (decisions related to whether to allocate additional resources to VA-provided care or expand
use of VA-purchased care). Our findings will also enable more informed staff, clinician, and Veteran shared
decision-making about where to receive care."
10747844,"Summary:
Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) immunogenicity is a growing concern due to the increased interest in immune-
stimulating drug delivery technology. A recent study by Novartis demonstrated that 14 out of 14 patients dosed
with an experimental immune-stimulatory ADC developed a measurable anti-drug antibody (ADA) response.
ADA negatively affects treatment by neutralizing drugs, increasing drug clearance, and causing severe allergic
reactions. There is an urgent need for an effective method of conjugating payload to antibodies while
minimizing the development and the effects of ADAs. We have developed an ADC bioconjugation technology
that employs the conserved Q295 residue (continued funding provided by NIH 1RO1GM140026-O1A1) that we
believe will mitigate many of these ADA concerns. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that this
technology reduces Fc-gamma uptake in antigen presenting cells (APCs) and masks the drugs from binding to
ADAs by hiding them in a sterically occluded hydrophobic pocket on the Fc domain. This goal will be achieved
through the two aims. Aim #1 focuses on developing NMR and fluorescence-based tools to demonstrate that
ADC payloads at the Q295 site are constrained within the sterically occluded IgG1 hydrophobic pocket. To this
end we propose conjugating model payloads to the Q295 site using various linkers (such as short alkyl,
peptide, and PEG) and determining their proximity to the hydrophobic pocket using two experimental methods:
1) a proximity induced fluorescent quenching assay using Oregon Green 488, due to its ability to self-quench
and 2) F-19 protein NMR using a trifluoromethyl probe, due to its high sensitivity and low background level in
biological samples. Aim #2 focuses on demonstrating that payloads attached to the sterically occluded Q295
position have reduced ADA binding and reduced potential for eliciting immunogenicity caused by Fc-gamma
mediated uptake of ADCs. Achievement of the aims outlined herein will result in an antibody conjugation
technology that exhibits a reduced risk of ADA and may be useful for the design of immune-stimulating
antibody conjugates."
10782967,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The microbiome is the community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live in and on a host. Over the past few
decades, advances in sequencing technology have allowed us to better understand the composition of the
mammalian microbiome and the ways it affects host development. Recent evidence shows that Caesarean-
section delivery, though a medical necessity for some births, may disrupt the vertical transfer of microbiota
from mother to child. This can cause different microbial communities during critical periods of development.
The brain may be particularly sensitive to microbiome changes because neurogenesis in many brain regions
and myelination continue through childhood. This may be one explanation for the increased prevalence of
neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that are
associated with Caesarean delivery. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether microbial communities, and
specifically those caused by differential birth mode, can cause neuroanatomical changes. To advance our
understanding of Caesarean delivery’s effect on neurodevelopment, we will use a mouse model of Caesarean
delivery that will allow us to separately quantify the effect of birth mode on both the offsprings’ microbial
communities (Aim 1) and neurodevelopment (Aim 2). We hypothesize that perturbation of the infant
microbiome by Caesarean delivery will disrupt the normal pattern of neurodevelopment in pre-weaning mice (≤
postnatal day 21). To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will study microbial communities through next
generation sequencing, community structure analysis, and predicted bacterial gene content . Additionally, the
direct and local effects of the microbial community will be quantified by mRNA transcriptomic analysis of
gastrointestinal tissues. In Aim 2, we will study brain development through histology and transcriptomics of the
cerebellum and hippocampus. Both regions exhibit neurodevelopment in the early postnatal period and are
implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases. Gene expression will be quantified in each
brain region through mRNA transcriptomics. The results of this proposed study may inform targeted
microbiome-based interventions that restore microbial composition and function and facilitate proper
neurogenesis. This research will be completed between two labs at Rutgers university that have expertise in
microbiome analysis and neurodevelopment. The fellow will receive training to achieve his goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist. This will entail field-specific training in microbial ecology and neuroscience, as
well as the generalizable skills necessary to become an independent investigator, including: experimental
design, scientific writing and communication, and presentation skills."
10739317,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this NIH F31- Diversity application is to obtain support for the PI, Kristina Tymes-Wilbekin, for
mentored research and career development activities within her MD/PhD training that will enhance her potential
to become a successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in infectious disease
epidemiology and reproductive health that will allow the PI to study behavioral and socio-cultural factors that
influence women’s experiences and decisions related to sexual health outcomes using mixed method study
applications. The primary objective of the research proposal is to investigate potential relationships between
vaginal hygiene, sexual behaviors and uptake of ring-based multipurpose prevention technologies among
women at increased risk of unintended pregnancy and acquisition/transmission of sexually transmitted infections
or HIV infection. Currently new vaginal rings are being developed and tested as multipurpose prevention
technologies that act as a hormonal contraceptive and can prevent/treat sexually transmitted infections or HIV
infection. This project is specifically focused on understanding these factors in the context of intravaginal ring
delivery, due to a demonstration that a continuous contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) regimen has potential
noncontraceptive and pharmacological benefits that can increase women’s adherence. This project seeks to
quantitatively characterize perception of menstrual suppression among Kenyan women pre- and post-CVR use
(Aim 1), and then utilize the findings for development and application of a tool to assess similar perceptions in
African-American women in the Southeastern U.S. (Aims 2A and 2B). The long-term objective of our research
is to better understand women’s experience with CVRs in order to inform multipurpose prevention technology
development and improve sexual health options among high-risk populations.
 The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her project co-mentors, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo and
Dr. Sadeep Shrestha. Included within the training plan are objectives to help develop the PI in three major areas:
(1) rigorous research in the STI/HIV, contraception, and multipurpose prevention technology fields, including
familiarity with the existing literature, critically evaluating published studies, principles of scientific integrity and
responsible conduct of research, and methods or rigor and reproducibility; and (2) infectious disease
epidemiology, including methodology, study design, and biostatistical analysis; and (3) career and professional
development, inclusive of communication through presentations, journal article review, learning skills in grant
writing, and translation of research findings for clinical applications. The overall goal of this training plan is to
give the PI a foundation for a successful progression as a physician scientist and furthering the PI’s ultimate
career goal of working with a collaborative team that bridges the gap between epidemiological research and
improvement in women’s reproductive and sexual health outcomes."
10754267,"This is a proposal to combine our three NINDS funded R01 projects into one larger R35 award, enabling us the time and flexibility to explore important biological questions relevant to human neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past eight years, my laboratory has used a combination of yeast and human genetics to define novel mechanisms of ALS, FTD, and Parkinson's disease. These experiments have led to the discovery of ataxin 2 intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions as a major genetic risk factor for ALS, the discovery of RNA lariat debranching enzyme as a powerful therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathies, a new cellular pathway to explain how C9orf72 mutations could cause neurodegeneration and unexpected connections between seemingly distinct Parkinson's disease genes. In preliminary studies, we have found that genetic reduction of ataxin 2 in mouse profoundly extends survival of TDP-43 transgenic mice (>80% increase in lifespan). We propose studies to explore how ataxin 2 protects against TDP-43 proteinopathy, test ataxin 2 in other mouse models (e.g., C9orf72 and FUS/TLS), and to pursue antisense oligonucleotides targeting ataxin 2 in human cell models. While our previous work has stemmed from yeast models and genetic modifier screens, we now propose an ambitious advance – performing genomewide modifier screens in human cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene activation and inactivation libraries. We have already performed three pilot screens with C9orf72 models and have identified several potent modifiers, which we will validate in primary neurons and mouse models. I plan to take my lab into this new direction by performing CRISPR screens in human cells with TDP-43, FUS, alpha-synuclein, ataxin 2, and further C9orf72 models (e.g., RNA vs. DPRs). We are also interested in the process of RAN (repeat-associated non-ATG) translation, which has emerged as a powerful facet of several nucleotide-repeat diseases (including c9ALS/FTD). We propose experiments to discover the molecular mechanisms of RAN translation in order to design specific inhibitors and we have already identified at least two genes that seem to be required for RAN translation. Together, we present an ambitious research program aimed at defining novel mechanisms of human neurodegenerative diseases and then intensely working to translate those mechanisms to novel therapies to help treat these devastating conditions."
10538889,"Background: Advanced liver disease (AdvLD) is a serious illness that disproportionately affects Veterans. As
many as half of AdvLD patients die within 2 years of developing liver complications, and nearly all suffer
increasing symptoms and hospitalizations. Although many patients hope for curative liver transplantation, few
receive it while experiencing an increasingly severe illness. We found Veterans with AdvLD report many unmet
curative and supportive care needs. They also prefer to align care with their outcome goals earlier in the
AdvLD course than is now common. A Whole Health program in AdvLD focused on what matters most to
Veterans, shared goals, and goal-aligned treatments could improve both curative and supportive care.
Objectives: Our overall goal is to develop and test a sustainable Whole Health, Integrated-Veteran-centered
Care in Advanced Liver Disease (I-VCALD). We propose a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study
utilizing formative implementation assessment prior to an effectiveness trial and assessment of implementation
outcomes following the trial. Our specific aims are: 1) conduct a formative assessment of I-VCALD
implementation for Veterans with AdvLD; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of I-VCALD in a randomized controlled
study at 4 VA centers; and 3) conduct a summative assessment of implementation outcomes of I-VCALD.
Methods: For Aim 1, we will conduct a formative evaluation of implementation using stakeholder interviews
with patients, leadership, clinicians, and staff partners at the four study sites structured by i-PARiHS
framework. The assessment will identify barriers and promoters of I-VCALD implementation within VA,
strategies to overcome barriers and build on strengths, and modify existing tools to embed them into clinical
structures and workflows. Expected outcomes include recruitment of clinical champions and refinements to
study procedures to facilitate implementation in routine care; care counselor training program; informational
materials; EHR note templates; and menu of communication processes. For Aim 2, we will conduct a
randomized clinical trial to determine if I-VCALD improves timely decisions about transplantation and goals of
care planning. Secondary outcomes include goal concordant care, health related quality of life, shared
decision making, satisfaction with treatment experience, and quality of supportive AdvLD care. Participants will
be identified by population screening at participating sites for AdvLD and new onset complications and
confirmed by manual chart review. Consented patients will be randomized to usual care or referral to I-VCALD
nurse care manager who will conduct 4-5 visits over six months. The care counselor will facilitate serious
illness conversations to assess and cultivate patients’ understanding of their illness, identify patient priorities,
and work with patients’ clinicians to help tailor curative and supportive care such that it aligns with patients’
understanding of their prognosis and priorities. For Aim 3, we will conduct a summative evaluation of
implementation using the Proctor framework domains of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility,
fidelity, penetration, and cost to guide interpretation of study findings. Assessments include chart review,
qualitative interviews with patients, clinicians, and interventional staff, and structured implementation surveys.
Findings will inform adaptations and further efforts to implement and disseminate the I-VCALD approach.
Significance: Our proposed project has the potential to significantly improve care for AdvLD and could be a
model for redesigning care for other seriously ill Veteran populations. Together, these aims will provide
evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the I-VCALD approach and barriers and promotors of its
implementation across other VA sites. We have assembled an advisory panel including leadership from the
national VA whole health, gastroenterology and hepatology, and palliative care programs who will inform
adaptations and subsequent dissemination of integrated, whole health for AdvLD care."
10756461,"Project summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy resulting from demyelination and
axon degeneration. Many cases of axon degeneration are caused by mutations in Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), which is
one of two dynamin-like proteins on the surface of mitochondria. Mitofusins primarily mediate mitochondrial
outer membrane fusion, but Mfn2 can also promote association between ER and mitochondria in mitochondria
associated membranes (the MAM). It is observed in spots that colocalize with the mitochondrial fission
dynamin Drp1 and it was proposed to affect axonal transport of mitochondria, raising the possibility that CMT is
caused by defects in one of these other functions of Mfn2. Preliminary data show that Mfn2 promotes
constriction of mitochondria in Drp1–/– cells and fission in Drp1-Mfn1 DKO cells when treated with the fungal
toxin PXA that causes the release of calcium from the mitochondrial matrix. Calcium release and the ability to
constrict mitochondria was linked to Mfn2-mediated regulation of NCLX (a Ca/Na exchanger in the
mitochondrial inner membrane). It is hypothesized that PXA activates NCLX and that Mfn2 is required for this
activity. It is also hypothesized that NCLX-mediated calcium release causes mitochondrial constriction and that
the effects of Mfn2 on mitochondrial fission are linked to axonal transport, a process that could be disrupted in
CMT patients. These hypotheses will be tested by investigating three aims. Aim 1. Investigate connections
between PXA, NCLX, and Mfn2. These studies will include comprehensive tests whether PXA triggers
calcium release from mitochondria by activating NCLX and investigates of the control of NCLX by Mfn2. Aim 2.
Investigate connections between Mfn2 and mitochondrial fission. Effects of Mfn2 and NCLX on
mitochondrial fission will be tested with knockout cell lines and transfections of fission and fusion protein
constructs followed by analyses with a range of imaging techniques. Aim 3. Investigate the physiological
consequences of Mfn2 and NCLX contributions to fission. Effects on mitochondrial transport proteins will
be examined with kymographs of axonal processes in cultured neurons and zebrafish. Alternative functions,
such effects on metabolism and a role in mitophagy, will also be considered. Together, these experiments will
help establish NCLX as the target of PXA, assess the newly proposed role of Mfn2 in mitochondrial fission, and
test possible downstream effects on transport or mitophagy. These experiments may therefore reveal a novel
function for Mfn2 and shed new light on the underlying causes of CMT. Possible downstream effects of fission
on axonal transport will change the understanding of the underlying causes of CMT and may suggest novel
treatment strategies."
10752629,"BACKGROUND. Screening lies at the heart of preventive care. However, COVID-19 has dramatically disrupted
routine screening efforts, resulting in excess veteran mortality not directly attributable to COVID-19. Screening
rates at VA during COVID have varied markedly by facility and clinical condition. This is illustrated in cancer
and mental health screening; cross-facility variability exists for each, suggesting susceptibilities in the capacity
and workflow of the screening and referral process. To better understand these susceptibilities and identify
new practices to mitigate interrupted care, we propose a qualitative study comparing facilities that exhibited
high, low, and highly variable performance (respectively) in screening rates before and during the pandemic.
SIGNIFICANCE. Disruptions to preventive screening lead to excess veteran mortality. Therefore, caring for
veterans’ regular primary care (PC) needs while fulfilling our Fourth Mission (emergency preparedness)
requires top-notch coordination and nimble teamwork from all clinical personnel. Our study will identify the
systematic strategies and coordination patterns between primary and specialty care that differentiate
successful facilities from struggling ones. Our findings will help design new or adapt existing workflows and
interventions for coordination, shaping how screening and preventive care is delivered during and beyond
COVID-19. Our study directly addresses: a) this solicitation’s goals; b) HSR&D’s clinical priorities; c) VA’s
strategic plan goals for highly reliable care; and d) ORD real-world research impact priorities.
SPECIFIC AIMS. Using cancer and mental health screening rates as exemplars, we propose to (1) Compare
how PACTs from VHA facilities of varying screening performance patterns (high, low, improving, plummeting,
variable) during the COVID-19 pandemic coordinated (a) as a team to conduct screening services, and (b) with
specialty care teams at their facility to conduct screening services; and (2) Compare team, facility, and system-
based barriers, facilitators, and strategies for continuing screening services during the COVID-19 pandemic
amongst PACTs from VHA facilities of varying screening performance patterns during that period.
METHOD. Design and Participants. This multi-method study consists of qualitative analysis of interviews and
focus groups with primary care personnel, leadership, and patients at 10 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs).
Site Selection. We will select study sites using a purposive stratified approach based on site rurality, COVID-19
caseload at the beginning of the pandemic, and performance on five outpatient clinical performance indicators
of cancer and mental health screening. Sites will be categorized into one of five screening performance
groups: high performers, low performers, improvers, plummeters, and highly variable.
Procedure. Using data from prior research by the PI, we will create process maps for each performance
measure to create a baseline for comparison to the process used since the pandemic began. We will interview
the ACOS for primary care at each site to update the map to reflect the currently used process. We will
conduct focus groups with PC and relevant specialty care clinicians to elicit themes regarding clinician
coordination patterns (e.g., handoffs), strategies, and barriers/facilitators to screening during COVID (Aims 1-
3). We will also conduct patient interviews to examine their screening experience during this period, for
context.
Data Analysis: All interview and focus groups will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and enhanced by field notes.
We will analyze clinician focus group transcripts and field notes using iterative, rapid analysis. Patient semi-
structured interviews will be analyzed using inductive/deductive content analysis.
NEXT STEPS/IMPLEMENTATION. We will share our findings, including site-specific recommendations, locally
with key stakeholders at participating sites, and nationally through the Office of Primary Care-Mental Health
Integration program and the VA National Women Veterans Oncology System of Excellence."

 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), due to the increased morbidity and mortality among individuals who are infected
with this pathogen.1 As a common healthcare- and community-associated pathogen, MRSA has a high burden
of disease with over 300,000 cases and roughly 11,000 deaths in 2017.1 Though the overall rates of MRSA
infection have been decreasing nationwide, this has not translated in communities of color, as the rates of
healthcare-associated (HA), healthcare-associated community onset (HACO), and community-acquired (CA)
MRSA is much higher among blacks compared to white individuals. 2–6In addition, we understand that jails have
a disproportionately high prevalence rate of MRSA (19%) and a high proportion of people of color.7,8 Detainees
have high rates of recidivism with about 76.6% of prisoners are rearrested within five years. 8 Once released,
detainees interact with the community they came from prior entering the jail, resulting in potential transmission
events. What is not well-understood is if jails themselves are an amplifier of MRSA community transmission.
 In this proposal, we will investigate the relationship between jail transmission of MRSA and the potential
of transmission spillover into the wider community by utilizing genomic-based regression approaches and
individual-based modelling. The results will elucidate how can jails amplify community transmission, especially
among communities of color, and may perpetuate high rates of MRSA infections and/or colonization.
Understanding this phenomenon will allow us to improve MRSA surveillance in these communities and design
and increase targeted interventions in communities of color and within jails that potentially feed into their
communities."

An increasing number of undergraduates (~30% in the UC System) enter research universities
after 2+ years in community colleges. Transfer students are more likely to be underrepresented
minorities (URMs) or first-generation college students, and they seldom continue on to the PhD.
Although many of them express interest in research, they have little to no access to such
experiences at community colleges. Soon after matriculating at universities, they tend to opt out
of scientific research careers, particularly the idea of continuing to graduate school. In response
to this need and in the interest of increasing diversity in our population of neuroscience trainees,
here we propose a program to provide transfer students with the skills, mentorship, and
research experience to improve their chances of success in a research career. Our proposal
builds on the START program, which for three years brought cohorts of URMs and first-
generation transfer students to campus in the summer before they matriculated at UCSD. The
START program, and others like it, have resulted in improved outcomes for these students. Via
a partnership with local community colleges in collaboration with Academic Enrichment
Programs (AEP), the STARTneuro program will begin by identifying interested students before
they apply to UCSD. Accepted participants will then engage in a 10-week summer bridge
program, with intensive and immersive full-day lab training in neuroscience techniques, from
physiology to gene expression and function. Each student will also design and implement an
independent research project based on the summer modules. During the academic year,
students will meet regularly with faculty, be shepherded into lab internships, and be mentored in
applying for a summer research scholarship the following summer. A core group of faculty who
have demonstrated success mentoring undergraduates will provide the research experience
and stewardship necessary to ensure that participants can succeed in scientific research
beyond college."
10749012,"Project Summary
The main goal of this grant application is to identify microRNA (miRNA) targets that protect the alveolar
epithelium from excessive inflammation during acute lung injury (ALI). ALI is characterized by acute respiratory
failure in the setting of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
in humans. The current application is focused on identifying miRNAs that could be targeted to dampen alveolar
epithelial inflammation.
 To identify miRNA targets that dampen alveolar inflammation, we exposed mice to ventilator-induced lung
injury (VILI) and isolated alveolar epithelial cells. A microarray analysis identified miR-147 as a leading candidate.
Confirmatory studies demonstrated that miR-147 is induced during ALI by mechanical ventilation in vivo or
through in vitro exposure of alveolar epithelia to cyclic mechanical stretch. In vivo elevations of miR-147 levels
during ALI persisted despite depletion of neutrophils or macrophages. In addition, we identified a role for
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A for miR-147 induction. miR-147-/- mice experience more severe lung
injury during VILI. A search for miR-147 targets identified toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2) as pro-
inflammatory target. In line with a link of miR-147 with TICAM2 expression, we found that alveolar epithelia
isolated from miR-147loxp/loxp SPC Cre+ mice showed elevated Ticam2 levels. Similarly, increased
pulmonary edema during VILI of miR-147loxp/loxp SPC Cre+ mice was resuscitated by concomitant genetic
deletion of Ticam2. miR-147 overexpression via miR-147-containing nano-particles was protective during ALI.
Finally, proof-of-principle studies in ARDS patients showed elevated miR-147 levels in their BAL fluid. Therefore,
we hypothesize that HIF-dependent induction of miR-147 represents an endogenous pathway to dampen lung
inflammation. We designed 3 specific aims, where we will first study the expression of miR-147 utilizing in vitro
modeling systems (Aim 1). Aim 2 is focused on in vivo studies of ALI, where we will utilize tissue-specific
approaches of miR-147 deletion and examine mice with a mutation of the miR-147 binding site in the TICAM2 3'
untranslated region (genetic targeting for these mice was successful). Finally, we will target miR-147 for the
treatment of ARDS in Aim 3."
10916247,"The mission of our proposed Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) is to examine if dysregulation of sleep is
central to the development and exacerbation of symptoms in ASD. Animal data demonstrate that sleep is
essential for the maturation of fundamental brain structures, neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.
Sleep dysregulation is one of the most burdensome symptoms in individuals with ASD. Late sleep onset,
frequent nighttime awakening, sleep fragmentation and abnormal sleep quantity hallmark sleep in ASD. Sleep
EEG studies indicate less REM sleep and increased Non-REM Sleep. Despite its central role in brain
development and function, sleep impairments are frequently considered as secondary. The main goal of our
Center for Sleep in ASD is to determine if sleep disturbances reflect convergent pathways that can act as
causal for, and/or co-aggravating factors of, core, behavioral and cognitive symptoms in ASD. We propose a
multi-modal, human subjects and animal models program which encompasses four synergistic projects aimed
at characterizing the role of sleep fragmentation and physiology on the core symptoms of ASD. We will
examine Sleep EEG, daytime awake, resting EEG, and actigraphy in 150 individuals with ASD, 4 to 17 years,
compared to 75 age- and sex-matched Typical Developing (TD) controls and determine the impact of these
sleep parameters on core symptoms (Project 1). Using a target engagement approach, we will determine if
normalization of sleep is associated with improvements in the core symptoms (Project 2). We will examine if
these findings are recapitulated in genetic animal models of ASD (Mice: Project 3; & Zebrafish: Project 4). The
evolutionary conservation of Sleep EEG signatures and behavior makes this a powerful translational approach
as the same physiological parameters, biological endpoints and behavioral phenotypes can be compared
across species, revealing if there is a convergence of the impact of sleep phenotypes across different genetic
models of ASD, or alternatively differential pathways from sleep phenotypes to core symptoms.
Specific Aim 1: To leverage comparative biology across humans with ASD and controls and complementary
genetic animal models of ASD and wild type to examine if multisystem sleep measurements across species a)
converge on a common phenotype of sleep fragmentation and architecture in ASD; or b) capture different sub-
phenotypes of sleep dysregulation and sleep architecture across species. Specific Aim 2: Examine if a) the
sleep phenotypes identified are differentially associated with the core, behavioral and cognitive symptoms of
ASD across humans with ASD and complementary genetic animal models of ASD; b) if sleep normalization in
humans with ASD and in complementary genetic animal models of ASD, alleviate the core, behavioral and
cognitive symptoms of ASD; and c) if these effects are moderated by age and/or sex. Specific Aim 3: Provide
research and collaborative opportunities to junior and established researchers new to the field of autism, or
established in the field of autism but new to the research emphases of the ACE Center."
10748312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have excited patients and clinicians and have brought optimism
back into the oncology community. However, these therapies are often effective for only a percentage of patients,
and some patients may even be at risk for serious and sometimes fatal toxicities related to the therapy. Unlike
the toxicities induced by standard therapies, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are just becoming appreci-
ated, and side effect profiles for new immunotherapies are often poorly understood. Further contributing to this
issue is the increasing use of therapies that combine immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) with other checkpoint inhibitors or targeted thera-
pies. The unique toxicities of such combination therapies remain largely unknown and need to be tracked, so
that their immune-related safety profiles can be characterized and adequately managed. Researchers at The Uni-
versity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center propose to use patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to capture
symptomatic irAEs of combination therapies that include checkpoint inhibitors, taking advantage of the large
number of early-phase trials of these therapies already in place in the institution's Department of Investigational
Therapeutics, coupled with the expertise in longitudinal symptom assessment in the Department of Symptom
Research. The Specific Aims of the study are: (1) to identify, track, and evaluate emerging symptomatic toxic-
ities and symptom burden during early-phase clinical trials of treatments that include immune checkpoint in-
hibitors in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies; and (2) to investigate relation-
ships between longitudinal patient-reported symptoms and clinical outcomes (eg, development of moderate-to-
severe irAEs, time to treatment discontinuation, time to deterioration) in early-phase trials of combination treat-
ments that include checkpoint inhibitors, and to investigate whether moderate to severe irAEs are predicted by
increases in relevant symptoms prior to the event.
 The study's clinical impact will be early detection of irAEs associated with combination therapies that
include checkpoint inhibitors, to facilitate proactive intervention. Worsening symptoms may presage the emer-
gence of their clinical manifestations and allow for appropriate supportive care or for other treatment decisions
to be made. PROs are an essential component of cancer drug development, without which clinicians and regu-
lators have an incomplete picture of how patients are affected by a new agent. PROs will provide invaluable pa-
tient perspectives on the symptomatic effects of combination treatments that include immune checkpoint in-
hibitors to multiple stakeholders in early drug development (eg, patients, sponsors, regulators, and payers).
 This project addresses Recommendation F in the Cancer Moon Shot Blue Ribbon Panel 2016 report,
which calls for accelerated research to monitor and manage patient-reported symptoms, not only for improving
quality of life, but also for ensuring patient adherence to treatments that will improve therapeutic response.

Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ
biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic-
ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will
establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to
physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every
year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for
patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are
diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current
treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven
biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and
a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time-
dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure
control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early
longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep
learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics;
and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain
injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of
modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers
to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a
neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon
Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an
accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional
mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will
be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive
biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials
enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By
leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled
innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be
ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as
spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients."
10749940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Communication between neurons and their targets depends on proper synaptic growth and activity. The
microtubule cytoskeleton plays a central role in synaptic terminal development, and microtubule dysfunction is
associated with many neurological disorders. Neurons contain stable and dynamic microtubules, and these two
populations must be properly balanced for synapses to grow and form stable connections. In this proposal, we
use a synergistic combination of in vivo genetic analyses and cell-free in vitro biophysical approaches to
elucidate the mechanisms by which microtubule dynamics and stability are balanced. We leverage a novel α-
tubulin mutant that alters the normal microtubule balance and perturbs synaptic growth. This tubulin mutation
disrupts a highly conserved, essential α-tubulin site that is acetylated. Post-translational modifications (PTMs),
such as acetylation, have the potential to directly and specifically regulate microtubule stability and dynamics to
shape synaptic morphogenesis, yet relatively few microtubule PTMs have been studied. Our preliminary data
implicate this previously uncharacterized α-tubulin site in regulating the addition of tubulin dimers to growing
microtubule ends, which suggests a novel acetylation-based mechanism to control microtubule dynamics.
Based on our preliminary findings, we will test the hypothesis that microtubule dynamics and stability are
balanced by α-tubulin acetylation and other known regulators to shape synaptic terminal morphogenesis (Aim
1). We will use the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model and investigate the effects of manipulating
microtubule dynamics and stability on two different motor neuron types, called type Ib and type Is, whose
synaptic terminals have distinct morphologies and transmission properties. Our preliminary data indicate that
altering the microtubule cytoskeleton has strikingly different effects on the growth of type Ib and Is synaptic
terminals. We will test the hypothesis that stable and dynamic microtubules are uniquely balanced in different
neuron types to establish distinct neuron-specific synaptic structures and activities (Aim 2). Combined, our
studies will reveal novel mechanisms that regulate synaptic microtubule networks and provide fundamental
new insight into the central role that microtubules play in creating diverse synaptic morphologies and functions."
10766737,"The objectives of this proposal continue to focus on investigating the physiology/pathophysiology and cell biology of the absorption processes of vitamin B1 in the intestinal tract. Vitamin B1 (in its biologically active form, TPP) is essential for normal physiology and health of all cells due to its critical roles in oxidative energy metabolism, ATP production, and reduction of cellular oxidative stress. Deficiency of vitamin B1 occurs in a variety of conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases, sepsis and chronic alcoholism. 
 Humans/mammals cannot synthesize vitamin B1 endogenously, and thus, must obtain the vitamin from exogenous sources via intestinal absorption. Two sources of the vitamin are available to the host: dietary and microbiota-generated. We have previously characterized different aspects of the uptake process of free thiamin along the intestinal tract, and showed involvement of two transport systems: thiamin transporter-1 & -2 (SLC19A2 and SLC19A3, respectively). As to the microbiota-generated vitamin B1, a considerable amount of this source is provided in the form of TPP, and we have identified a high-affinity and specific carrier-mediated process for its uptake by colonocytes. We have also cloned a specific TPP transporter from the colon (the cTPPT; product SLC44A4 gene), showed its expression along the GI tract to be restricted to the large intestine, and demonstrated its exclusive localization at the apical membrane domain of epithelia. Our objectives in this proposal are to determine the contribution of cTPPT toward total carrier-mediated uptake of TPP in native colonic tissue, its role in colon physiology/health, whether it has interactor(s) that influence its physiology/cell biology, and molecular determinant(s) that dictates its apical targeting. We also aim to investigate the effects of conditions/factors that the intestinal tract is exposed to under certain disease states [namely, hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flagellin] on TPP uptake. In new preliminary studies, we have generated homozygous Slc44a4 loxP+/+ mice [a critical step towards generating a large intestine-specific Slc44a4 knockout (KO) mice], identified putative interactors with cTPPT, and found a critical role for its cytoplasmic tail in apical targeting. We also found that exposure of colonic epithelia to hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS and flagellin to lead to inhibition in vitamin B1 uptake. Based on these new (and previous) findings, our working hypotheses in this proposal are that the cTPPT (SLC44A4) is the predominant system involved in carrier-mediated TPP uptake in native colon, it is important for colon physiology/health, it has interacting partner(s), and that its apical targeting is dictated by specific structural motif(s) in its structure. We also hypothesize that exposure of colonic epithelia to hypoxia, pro- inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial products to lead to inhibition in TPP uptake. We will test these hypotheses by accomplishing two specific aims and will utilize state-of the-art physiological/molecular approaches. Results of these studies should provide new information regarding intestinal vitamin B1 absorption in health and disease, which should assist in the designing effective strategies to optimize its homeostasis/nutrition, and thus, improve health."
10756997,"Project Summary/Abstract
The current opioid epidemic is a major health crisis that has contributed to decreased life expectancy in the U.S.
A main cause of morbidly and mortality is opioid reuse and relapse in chronic cases. Understanding the
neurocognitive mechanisms and factors underlying reuse vulnerability is thus a pressing need. Leveraging a
novel combination of neurocognitive tools and a multi-session longitudinal design, our recent work in opioid use
disorder (OUD) has begun to delineate a precise decision making mechanism for opioid reuse by showing that
treatment-engaged patients are at higher risk for reuse when they exhibit increased tolerance of unknown
probabilistic outcomes (ambiguity tolerance) in a financial choice task (Konova et al., 2019 JAMA Psychiatry).
But why patients become more tolerant of ambiguous uncertainty in periods preceding reuse remains unknown.
One potential explanation consistent with decision theory is that, in these periods, they become overoptimistic
about ambiguous outcomes, which leads them to overestimate the probability of good outcomes (or
underestimate bad outcomes) when faced with a decision to reuse, and therefore more likely to do so. Here, we
propose a multi-level, convergent test of this framework by using well-defined, quantitative measures of this
presumed “optimism bias”, alongside quantitative measures of uncertainty tolerance, which we propose to collect
with concurrent high-resolution fMRI recordings, and yoked to longitudinal clinical assessments. In Aim 1, we
aim to establish the relationship between uncertainty tolerance and optimism bias in patients with OUD and
matched controls by studying these behaviors across a set of choice and estimation tasks (the latter designed
to capture optimism about simple financial and more complex outcomes, tapping into drug-choice-relevant
domains such as health outcomes). We also examine for potential moderation by various psychopathological
dimensions in a large, unselected population of online (MTurk) subjects. In Aim 2, we collect fMRI data during
the same choice and estimation tasks to delineate the mechanism by which optimistic neural representations of
uncertainty might drive behavioral tolerance of this uncertainty, and reuse, in OUD. In Aim 3, we use a multi-
session longitudinal design to understand the interaction between optimism bias and uncertainty tolerance as
they relate to opioid reuse, session-to-session, allowing us to elucidate the specific timescale and nature of this
interaction. With this project we aim to provide an answer to why patients become more uncertainty tolerant in
periods preceding reuse and, in doing so, hope to uncover an upstream mechanism (centered on optimism bias)
of this vulnerability, including its neural implementation. In addition to this conceptual advance, this work will
provide a novel set of cognitive tools to precisely and objectively measure these processes with potential to
predict poor outcomes such as reuse, in a way that can be easily implemented in clinical settings. Finally, the
findings from this work will inform novel therapeutic interventions by providing precise neurocognitive targets, as
well as their ideal timing, with the goal of mitigating reuse risk and improving long-term patient outcome."

Brain tumors are the most common solid tumor and the leading cause of cancer-related death in children.
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Dissemination (metastasis) of MB
results in seeding the leptomeningeal membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The unique pattern of
dissemination leads to a relatively non-empirically supported model in which medulloblastoma was assumed to
spread through passive shedding of cells into the cerebrospinal fluid, followed by distal implantation on the
surface of the nervous system. We have now demonstrated experimentally, that medulloblastoma in fact
disseminates through the blood circulation just like every other known type of human cancer, with
hematogenously disseminated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) re-homing to the leptomeningeal compartment of
the nervous system. CTCs reseed the leptomeninges almost exclusively, only rarely seeding organs outside the
central nervous system. Hematogenous dissemination of medulloblastoma is an exciting development that offers
the chance for novel approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of metastatic medulloblastoma.
The vast majority of medulloblastoma patients experience a `metastasis free' interval by imaging before their
metastatic recurrence, which may offer a window to prevent metastatic recurrence. In patients with established
metastatic disease, identifying the genes enabling CTCs to drive metastases could prevent or ameliorate disease
progression, offering novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for medulloblastoma patients. Therefore we
will:
Aim 1). Isolate and analyze circulating tumor cells from humans and mice with MB to determine the utility of
 CCL2 and CCR2 as biomarkers for the development of metastases within distinct MB subgroups.
Aim 2). Manipulate CCL2/CCR2 expression using genetic/cell biology techniques to determine the contribution
 of each to MB metastasis in human xenograft and genetically modified mouse models that recapitulate distinct
 MB subgroups.
Aim 3). Use established FDA approved drugs and antibodies, as well as emerging drugs and tool compounds,
 to block CCL2/CCR2, individually, together, and in combination with chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation
 in mouse models, to determine if we can prevent, and/or treat the dissemination of MB preclinically.
There are no drugs or therapies for medulloblastoma metastases, despite the fact that metastases are the
overwhelming cause of death, and the major source of long-term morbidity. We present a series of experiments
that clarify how brain tumors can spread hematogenously, identify markers to improve diagnosis, and develop
therapies applicable in near term to the treatment of metastatic MB in children."
10739301,"ABSTRACT
Osteoblasts are critical components of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche that regulate hematopoiesis.
More recently, they have emerged as critical regulators of the development of hematological myeloid
malignancies. We showed that a single activating mutation in -catenin signaling in osteoblasts is
sufficient to lead to the development of MDS, eventuall progressing to AML in mice. The disease is
transplantable and characterized by clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. Activated -catenin signaling is
present in osteoblasts of 38% of MDS patients suggesting that this pathway may sustain dysplastic
hematopoiesis and progression to MDS and AML in humans. Our initial observations support this indication
and further suggest a novel means for treating this particular population of patients. In search of a potential
FDA-approved compound with the ability to inhibit -catenin signaling we came across all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA). ATRA is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia where its mechanism of action relies
on its ability to dissociate the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allow DNA transcription and
differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes. However, reports from in vitro
studies indicate that ATRA has another function: it inhibits -catenin functions. We have found that inhibition of
-catenin signaling in 14 MDS/ patients with active -catenin in their osteoblasts with ATRA improved their
hematologic phenotype, stabilized disease status and inhibited -catenin activity. It also treated MDS and
prevented disease transformation in MDS mice expressing constitutive active -catenin in osteoblasts. Based
on these observations, we hypothesize that interrupting -catenin signaling in osteoblasts of MDS mouse
models and MDS patients with active -catenin in their osteoblasts by pharmacological means will
improve disease outcome. This may be achieved with ATRA, which may find a new use specifically in the
treatment of the portion of MDS patients with activated -catenin in their osteoblasts. To test this hypothesis
we will examine whether ATRA inhibits -catenin-induced MDS in mouse models of activated -catenin in
osteoblasts; and whether this inhibition is independent of actions on HSCs. We will also dissect the molecular
mechanism of -catenin inhibition by ATRA; and, verify the significance and specificity of ATRA inhibition in
cytogenetically different types of human MDS with activated -catenin in osteoblasts in vitro and in xenograft
models we developed to examine interactions between human MDS and stromal cells."
10756493,"Despite the importance of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) for epithelial maintenance in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
and the clinical significance of inflammatory intestinal disorders and immune-mediated GI damage, the
potential of the immune system to directly engage with the ISC compartment remains poorly understood. GI
graft vs. host disease (GVHD) is one of the greatest challenges for allogeneic hematopoietic/bone marrow
transplantation (allo-BMT), causing severe toxicity, necessitating deeply immunosuppressive interventions, and
limiting the wider usage of allo-BMT for potentially curable conditions. We have found that acute GVHD leads
to substantial reduction of Lgr5+ ISCs and the Paneth cells providing their epithelial niche. While there is limited
understanding of the precise mechanisms by which immune responses induce ISC compartment damage and
regeneration, it is not possible to fully understand BMT-related complications in the GI tract or how immune
cells may impact specific epithelial components without examining the three-dimensional (3-D) tissue
environment of the intestines and the proximity of immune responses to the ISC compartment. We seek to
understand the fundamental interactions occurring between the immune system and the ISC compartment,
how these interactions are engaged in the context of hematopoietic transplantation, and how the underlying
biology may be manipulated therapeutically for clinical intervention. To address these goals, we have
developed a research proposal emphasizing 3-D imaging of immune effectors within GI tract, mechanistic ex
vivo modeling of murine and human immune cell recruitment to the ISC compartment, and in vivo validation in
experimental transplant models. We have also assembled a multi-disciplinary team of collaborators at the
forefront of basic and translational immunology, ISC biology, and advanced microscopic imaging. Our
preliminary findings indicate that the ISC compartment is the first site of allogeneic T cell invasion within the
intestinal mucosa after BMT and thus the initial target of GVHD. Furthermore, we have found that co-cultures
of immune cells and intestinal organoids can be used to model and mechanistically dissect these processes.
Using 3-D confocal and 2-photon intravital imaging, we have developed the capacity to accurately quantify loss
of ISCs, specific invasion of the ISC compartment, and localization of T cell homing ligands during
homeostasis and during active immunity. We have also developed strategies for analysis of in vivo lineage-
specific gene expression within the ISC compartment. This study will thus test the hypothesis that lymphocyte
recruitment to and regulation of the ISC compartment are central features of GI damage post-transplant,
impacting both physiologic and pathologic mucosal responses, and we will evaluate approaches to modulate
lymphocyte homing and promote recovery of injured epithelium. This project will lead to a mechanistic
understanding of fundamental interactions between the ISC compartment and the immune system, opening a
new direction for treatment of GVHD and other GI disorders by protecting ISCs and augmenting regeneration."

The ability to heal is essential for human health. The remarkable wound healing capacity of humans (and
indeed of all animals) is a complicated process. Genomic studies suggest that more than 5000 mRNA
transcripts change expression patterns during wound healing, and more than a dozen cell types participate.
Despite the large number of cells and molecules that are involved, many aspects of the complexity of wound
healing are not well understood. Systems approaches have established the breadth of genes involved in
healing, and have compared gene profiles in different types of wounds. Yet many questions about the
networks and interactions within wounds are still unanswered. The research proposed here couples novel
quantitative approaches with basic biologic research to examine several questions related to the complexity
and diversity of the events that compose tissue repair. The research plan addresses three separate but
complementary questions. Question 1 asks - What are the regulatory pathways that underlie the differential,
site specific healing that is seen in skin versus oral mucosa? Studies by us and others have shown that
wounds in the oral mucosa exhibit faster re-epithelialization, reduced inflammation, a better-developed
angiogenic response, and less scar formation as compared to skin. Oral mucosal and skin wounds also have
distinctive transcriptomes. The central concept underlying Question 1 is that key transcription factors are
responsible for the differential healing seen in these two tissues. The research approach uses state-of-the-art
algorithms and in vivo experiments to discover and validate the transcription factors (and their networks) that
distinguish oral mucosal and skin healing. Question 2 asks - What is the level of redundancy in healing
wounds? This question explores the robustness of healing by assessing molecular redundancy. Redundancy
has been posited to exist in wounds as a “fail-safe” mechanism, insuring that wound healing proceeds even if
some key elements are functionally inactivated. The underlying concept for Question 2 is that significant gene
compensation occurs in wounds when specific genes are deleted. The approach uses genetically deficient
(“knockout”) mice to examine the extent of redundancy in healing wounds. Question 3 asks- Can quantitative
models be used to predict wound healing outcomes? Our ongoing collaboration utilizes a novel computational
modeling framework called the dynamic cellular finite-element model (DyCelFEM) to develop a model of
epithelial repair that is predictive of healing responses. The research plan extends the model to include
additional features of wound healing, such as angiogenesis. When completed, the model can be used to test
the effect of perturbations of single or multiple factors on healing outcomes. This advanced model will be a
powerful tool that can contribute to our understanding of both the pathophysiology of chronic wounds and the
development of therapeutics. Taken together, the three elements of the research plan address how wound
healing is governed at a network level, and will uncover critical features that regulate the ability to heal."

Difficulties with pragmatic (i.e., social) language are a highly clinically significant feature of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) that can impose a significant burden on autistic individuals throughout the lifespan. Strong
evidence suggests that pragmatic language can also be subtly impacted among clinically unaffected first-degree
relatives, constituting a principal feature of the broad autism phenotype (BAP) believed to reflect ASD-related
genetic influence. Understanding the causes of pragmatic difficulties in ASD is therefore critically important for
improving clinical care (e.g., by tailoring interventions to target underlying mechanistic factors), and for informing
gene-brain-behavior connections. Importantly, research on pragmatic language in ASD has primarily focused on
English speakers, and no studies have examined the pragmatic language features of the BAP cross-linguistically.
Because pragmatic language is fundamentally cultural, understanding how pragmatic profiles, and their
mechanistic underpinnings, might differ across languages and cultures is critical, especially in increasingly
multilingual societies (including the US). In this proposal, our multidisciplinary international team of investigators
will employ an armamentarium of cutting-edge analytic platforms and innovative deep behavioral and targeted
neural phenotyping methods to delineate similarities and differences in pragmatic language profiles in ASD and
the BAP, across speakers of Cantonese and English. By examining how pragmatic profiles may differentially
express in these two typologically distinct languages (including how pitch processing and related pragmatic
language mechanisms differ across speakers of tone and non-tone languages), analyses will provide insights
into the complex biological and environmental influences on ASD pragmatic profiles. Our prior work and new
preliminary data strongly indicate that neuro-auditory, speech rhythmic, and articulatory contributors to pragmatic
language are robustly impacted in both Cantonese- and English-speaking ASD groups, supporting our
hypothesis that core pragmatic features are subserved by fundamental and biologically deep mechanistic
processes with strong genetic etiology. Using a family-study design, this project will not only comprehensively
characterize pragmatic language profiles across speakers of Cantonese and English, but importantly, also examine
the mechanistic underpinnings of these pragmatic language profiles that may be common across languages, or
language-specific. Further, complementary light phenotyping is applied in tandem with machine-learning data-
driven analyses, including natural language processing, in a larger verification sample. Findings will highlight both
those pragmatic features under strong biological influence, as well as those that are potentially more malleable to
environmental influences, such as linguistic structure and cultural features."
10734068,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disorder characterized by articular cartilage damage and alterations to
the structure of subchondral bone, is the most common joint disease worldwide1. Numerous genetic loci2 and
environmental factors such as biomechanical stress3–8 have been associated with joint health and may modulate
the regulation of gene expression on the road to mediate disease. However, how these factors interact to initiate
OA pathogenesis is still unclear. To evaluate the effects of gene-by-environment interactions on gene regulation
in the context of human OA development, the work proposed here will study inter-individual variation in gene
expression responses to biomechanical stress in chondrocytes, the primary cells of cartilage. Specifically, in Aim
1, I will characterize gene expression in stressed and control chondrocytes using an iPSC-derived
biomechanical strain model of OA. I have optimized a cyclic tensile strain treatment regimen model of OA9–12
for use on iPSC-derived chondrocytes13. I have further applied these methods to three individuals from a panel
of 58 Yoruba (abbreviation: YRI) human iPSC lines14. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data from this
experiment, I have identified patterns of differential gene expression between biomechanical strain conditions.
In the continuation of this work, I will differentiate all 58 YRI iPSC lines into chondrocytes and characterize bulk
and single-cell transcription in strained and control chondrocytes. In Aim 2, I will identify biomechanical strain
dynamic expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in differentiated chondrocytes. I have used data from
a small-scale pilot study to establish the viability of this strain model of OA for mapping eQTLs. I will use RNA-
seq data collected in Aim 1 to identify dynamic eQTLs that vary in effect between treatment conditions while
assessing and accounting for disparities in differentiation efficiency and heterogeneity in the response to cyclic
tensile strain. In Aim 3, I will integrate mapped dynamic eQTLs with genome-wide association study (GWAS)
and epigenetic data to better understand the functional consequences of variation at genetic loci
associated with OA. I will test for enrichment and colocalization of my dynamic eQTLs among published
significant OA GWAS loci15 to determine if OA genetic associations could influence OA risk through context-
specific gene regulation. I will also evaluate the tissue-specificity of my dynamic eQTLs using data from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression Project16. Finally, I will collect DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility data
from my in vitro system to assess how these molecular phenotypes change in response to biomechanical stress
and potentially mediate transcriptional changes. Overall, my work will elucidate the genetic basis of how
biomechanical stress impacts human joint health. More broadly, my project will deepen our understanding of
how genetic associations with complex diseases may be mediated through gene-by-environment interactions.
At the same time, this work will provide me abundant opportunities to grow my wet lab and computational
research skills while benefitting from the support of a wide group of collaborators and mentors."

 Insulin-mediated pseudoacromegaly (IMPA) is a rare insulin resistance syndrome that is distinct from other
insulin resistance syndromes, as it leads to overgrowth and tall stature. Despite the handful of reported cases in
the literature, there is no molecular or genetic explanation for this disease. Exome sequencing on an adolescent
female with IMPA and her sibling and parents revealed that she carries two rare, potentially deleterious, variants
in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) and 𝛽𝛽-Klotho (KLB), which form the receptor complex for
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21). We hypothesize that these mutations explain the extreme insulin
resistance, tall stature, and lipodystrophy-like phenotype seen in IMPA. To test the function of these FGFR1 and
KLB variants in vivo, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to create a transgenic knock-in mouse line with
these variants and corrected the FGFR1 and KLB mutations in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line
isolated from our proband with IMPA. In this study, we are proposing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will determine whether the metabolic and physical phenotype of IMPA mice (with mutations in Fgfr1/Klb) is a
consequence of impaired FGF21 signaling. In Aim 2, we will determine if the insulin resistance seen in IMPA is
due to impaired adipocyte function. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism of fatty liver disease in IMPA
mutant mice.
 In addition to forming a functional genetic approach toward defining a novel insulin resistance syndrome, this
four-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's career development in
academic pediatric endocrinology. This strategy logically builds on the principal investigator's previous research
experience and clinical training. After obtaining his MD, the principal investigator completed his residency training
in general pediatrics, and fellowship in pediatric endocrinology. This proposal now focuses on expanding his
scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in studying a transgenic
mouse model of a rare human insulin resistance syndrome. The career development goals will be achieved
through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. David Ornitz (fibroblast growth factors and
transgenic mouse models) and Dr. Fumihiko Urano (metabolic testing in mice), hands-on laboratory experience,
scientific investigation, and training in genetics/genomics, biostatistics, scientific communication, and research
ethics. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of complementary experiences at
Washington University and St. Louis Children's Hospital. Successful completion of this career development
award will result in the principal investigator's transition to an independent physician-scientist. Additionally, this
work will contribute to a better understanding of the role that FGF21 plays in human insulin resistance, which will
provide the foundation for the principal investigator to apply for future R01-level funding."
10744218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutation of the TP53 gene is frequent in human cancer with wild-type p53 clearly being implicated as a tumor
suppressor. A growing body of evidence now supports the notion that tumor-associated mutant p53 has not only
lost tumor suppressing activity, but has also gained oncogenic roles. Thus, a central and significant challenge is
to elucidate the molecular bases both for the tumor suppressing functions of wild-type p53 and the oncogenic
activities of mutant p53 as well as deconvoluting the molecular relationship between these two. It is reasonable
to expect that relevant detailed insights into wild-type-mediated tumor suppression will inform understanding of
mutant-driven oncogenesis and vice versa. It is further hypothesized that by studying wild-type and mutant p53
in parallel, insights will be gained that would have been otherwise elusive. Further confounding this complex
question, studies using mouse models in vivo indicate that p53-driven cell fate outcomes, be they tumor
suppressing or oncogenic, can be tissue-specific. Although p53 has been shown to have cytoplasmic functions,
its role in controlling gene expression is certainly central to both its wild-type tumor suppressing role and its
mutant oncogenic function. The goal of the planned studies is to address this significant issue which carries
important translational potential. Specific aims are proposed to explore the tissue-specific transcriptional activity
of either wild-type or mutant p53 in vivo and to identify lineage-specific determinants for p53-driven fate outcomes
in a subset of tissues, namely, liver, thymus, and spleen. The first aim is focused on wild-type p53 in vivo and
involves elucidating the molecular basis for cell lineage as a determinant for the wild-type p53-dependent
response to DNA damage. The second aim deals with tumor-associated mutant p53 and is to explore the
molecular basis for the tissue-specific oncogenic activity of mutant p53. Given the essential role of transcriptional
regulation in the activity of p53, it is postulated that downstream control of specific target genes are key
determinants of cellular outcomes. Elucidating the molecular basis for the tumor suppressor activity of wild-type
p53 is essential to be able to exploit such findings as a means to restore this function in tumor cells as a
therapeutic approach. Likewise, the existence of gained oncogenic activity by tumor-associated mutant p53
provides the unexpected possibility for a targeted therapy involving a tumor suppressor. As a key difference
between normal and tumor cells is their p53 status, it is anticipated that such approaches are likely to have a
high therapeutic index. Given the tissue-specificity of responses to p53, it is essential that studies of p53-driven
fate outcomes be addressed in a cell lineage-dependent manner, providing a central tenet for the proposed
research."
10753544,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
The PI's research program in population genetics focuses on the coalescent-based inference of population his-
tories from whole genomes, and the determination of genetic basis of adaptation and disease at multiple biolog-
ical scales—from mutations to genes to gene subnetworks. In the genomic era, computational and statistical
methods are essential for identifying candidate adaptive and disease-associated mutations in humans, in whom
mapping via linkage studies is challenging and costly. State-of-the-art approaches that scan genome-wide for
signatures of selection or association with phenotype state are routinely applied to samples from one homoge-
neous ancestry, rely on arbitrary thresholds for interpreting results, and produce results at genomic scales that
can be difficult to connect to biological mechanism (for example, analyzing linkage blocks or sliding genomic
windows). Thus, despite the enormous investments made by the NIH and biobanks around the world to generate
large-scale genomic datasets from diverse individuals, methods for analyzing such datasets are lagging behind.
This application describes a series of projects motivated by answering three fundamental questions in human
population genetics: (1) what role has balancing selection played in human adaptation? (2) to what extent has
adaptive evolution versus non-adaptive processes shaped human genomes? (3) to what extent do the genetic
architectures of human traits vary by ancestry? The overall strategy for future research plans draws on the PI's
expertise in coalescent theory, Bayesian inference, population genetics, and statistical genetics to produce new
frameworks for analyzing patterns in and evolutionary processes underlying multiethnic genomic datasets. The
outcomes of the research described in this MIRA application will give new insight into the interaction between
selection and dynamic population histories in generating human genetic diversity, while determining the different
modes of selection shaping human phenotypes and diseases."

Aging is the most powerful risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and it contributes to the odds of type-2
diabetes mellitus (T2D) as well. Aging is also associated with a decline in the brain’s use of glucose, its most
important fuel. Astrocytes play a key role in shuttling glucose from the bloodstream to where it is needed by
the neuronal units of activity deeper in the brain tissue. We find evidence of a defect in a key glucose transport
molecule of astrocytes in AD and in a mouse line genetically modified to reproduce some aspects of AD. This
mouse line, overproducing the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), exhibits dysregulation of circulating glucose, as well as
a decline in brain glucose use. These effects are correlated with poor performance in a test of spatial memory.
Further mimicking human AD, the mice show these problems in the absence of obesity, hyperglycemia,
disruption of appetite, changes in physical activity, pancreatic abnormality, or insulin resistance. Together,
these findings inspire the hypothesis that Aβ, the levels of which begin to rise in the aging brain even without
frank AD, perturbs the ability of astrocytes to bring peripheral glucose to neurons, where it is needed for the
increased neurological activity associated with memory and other functions. This idea will be tested through
studies of the status and function of glucose transport proteins in aging mouse and human brains, along with
comparisons between normal aging, AD, and T2D. Through genetic modification of mice, we will modulate the
levels of the most important astrocytic glucose transporter to determine if it is i) sufficient to bring about
interrupted glucose delivery and memory deficits, and ii) necessary for the presentation of these problems in
an AD model. These studies thus explore a novel hypothesis about a specific element of energy utilization in
the aging brain and its connection to age-related cognitive impairment. As such, the project may provide
innovative strategies for therapeutic intervention."
10755667,"ABSTRACT
This revised application requests 5 years of support to continue a translational research program that has made
numerous important contributions to our understanding of opioid use disorder (OUD). More than 2 million
Americans have OUD and the number of deaths due to opioid overdose continues to rise, in part because of the
increased availability of fentanyl and its analogs that are potent, inexpensive, and easy to manufacture. This
public health crisis continues despite the availability of medications that substitute for or block the abuse-
related and toxic effects of opioids. New and better treatments are needed to address this crisis; ideally, an
effective medication for OUD would be nonopioid with little or no abuse or dependence liability and few other
adverse effects. Research proposed in this application explores the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a
constituent of cannabis that is available increasingly due to legalization of “medical” and “recreational” cannabis
by states as well as Federal approval of the CBD-containing medication Epidiolex®. Data from our pilot studies,
from other preclinical laboratories, and from a recent study in humans69 suggest that CBD, while itself having no
abuse liability, shows promise for treating various dimensions of OUD. Moreover, some studies suggest that
mixtures of CBD and Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; Marinol®) might be more effective than CBD alone for
treating OUD. The proposed research also responds to the NIH initiative to repurpose drugs already approved
for use in humans by exploring the therapeutic potential of CBD, given alone and with THC, for treating different
dimensions of OUD, including drug taking, relapse, and withdrawal. CBD/THC mixtures also simulate
cannabis use, which will identify any detrimental effects of cannabis use by patients taking CBD for OUD. These
experiments will use well-established procedures that are ongoing in our laboratory and that are highly
translatable to humans. Aim 1 will tackle drug taking and relapse by determining the effects of CBD, alone or
with THC, on fentanyl self-administration in a food versus drug choice procedure and on reinstatement of
responding previously reinforced by fentanyl. Aim 2 will evaluate the ability of CBD, alone or with THC, to
attenuate withdrawal in morphine-dependent monkeys, and Aim 3 will investigate changes in opioid toxicity by
characterizing the effects of CBD on the ventilatory-depressant, antinociceptive, and cognitive effects of opioids
as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of CBD alone and in combination with opioids. The persistence of the
opioid crisis underscores the need to explore potential new treatments including nonopioid medications to
increase options for treating OUD. In the period of just a few years, CBD has become widely available, promoted
for a broad range of indications, and used extensively despite very little rigorous research that either supports or
refutes its therapeutic potential. CBD is safe, has no abuse liability, and is approved by the FDA; if the proposed
studies provide proof-of-principle in nonhuman primates for using CBD to treat one or more dimensions of OUD,
then clinical trials in patients could begin very soon and have an immediate impact on the opioid crisis."

This second competitive renewal seeks to continue our innovative and productive research program which
seeks to understand the etiology of drug use disorders (DUD) utilizing data available on the entire population of
Sweden of unparalleled completeness and depth. We have eight specific aims: i) to use a newly developed
genetic risk score for DUD for the entire Swedish population to explore boundaries of the DUD phenotype,
model gene x environment interactions and clarify origins of DUD-related comorbidities; ii) to understand the
impact of social roles/relationships (e.g., marriage, divorce, parenthood) on risk and resilience for DUD; iii) to
explore the etiology of opiate use disorder (OUD) by comparing the social, familial and genetic risk factors
OUD and non-opiate DUD, by clarifying the etiologic role of opiate prescriptions in OUD development and to
identify clinically meaningful subtypes of OUD, especially an iatrogenic form; iv) to investigate the impact of
institutional settings on subsequent DUD, focusing on military service and incarceration; v) to evaluate the
impact of synthetically constructed populations compared to actual Swedish populations in the evaluation of
DUD and OUD utilizing FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) developed by our
collaborators at the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory (PHDL) at University of Pittsburgh; vi) to improve our
contagion models for the transmission of DUD by taking advantage of new data available in Swedish registries
on high school attendance, college attendance and workplace, improved Geographic Information Systems and
FRED; vii) to explore the association between stressful and traumatic events including COVID-19 exposure
severity and stress-related disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) with DUD onset and
recurrence and examine moderators of impact of both exposures and stress-related disorders on DUD and viii)
using a calibrated, detailed version of the Swedish population in FRED, to evaluate the predicted impact of a
range of mitigation strategies, based on the relationships defined by our earlier work and new findings from the
above aims. We will, for many of these aims, attempt to clarify the causal nature of the observed associations
using statistical and natural experimental methods. We will use comprehensive data from multiple nationwide
data sources in Sweden on 11.8 million men and women to accomplish these goals. Applying the deep
expertise of our research groups at Virginia Commonwealth, PHDL and Lund University in drug abuse
research, social and genetic epidemiology, causal inference and epidemiological model development to a
uniquely powerful sample, we expect this study to have important implications for DUD research, prevention
and policy."
10753524,"ABSTRACT
Metabolic reprogramming is an important hallmark of cancer. Of the altered metabolic pathways associated
with malignancy, one-carbon (C1) metabolism is particularly notable. The 3-carbon of serine is the major C1
donor for de novo synthesis of purines and thymidylate in the cytosol, and the primary catabolic pathway for
serine and synthesis of glycine occurs in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial C1 pathway also generates
reducing equivalents and is an important source of ATP. The first enzyme of the mitochondrial C1 pathway,
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 2, is an oncodriver which is upregulated in a substantial number of
cancers. Growing evidence suggests that SHMT2 could be an independent prognostic factor and an important
therapeutic target for cancer. We discovered novel 5-substituted pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine compounds AGF291,
AGF347, and AGF359. Following their internalization by the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), these
compounds inhibit mitochondrial C1 metabolism at SHMT2, with direct secondary inhibitions of cytosolic
targets in de novo purine (DNP) biosynthesis (at 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase) and SHMT1. Our compounds inhibit
proliferation of epithelial ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer
(PaC) cells, suggesting their potential as broad-spectrum anti-tumor agents. AGF347 exhibited significant in
vivo antitumor efficacy with potential for complete responses against both early and upstage PaC xenograft
models. We posit that our novel compounds offer an entirely new approach for treating cancer. Our objective
is to optimize our lead structures for tumor targeting via PCFT and inhibition of mitochondrial and cytosolic
C1 metabolism at modest doses with minimal toxicity. We will use PaC as a disease prototype for further
development of our novel multi-targeted inhibitors. In Aim 1, we will synthesize up to 100 compounds based
on lead compounds to optimize uptake by tumors, and inhibition of SHMT2 and cytosolic pathways including
DNP biosynthesis. In Aim 2, we will test analogs from Aim 1 for antitumor potencies toward clinically relevant
PaC cell lines, tumor selectivity and plasma membrane and mitochondrial drug transport, drug metabolism, and
inhibition of SHMT2 and cytosolic pathways including DNP biosynthesis. We will measure downstream impacts
on mTOR signaling, mitochondrial respiration, glutathione pools, and reactive oxygen species. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and in vivo antitumor activities of compounds from Aims 1 and 2 by
toxicity/efficacy trials with human PaC cell line xenograft and PDX models, and with the KPC mouse PaC model.
Our lead analogs are “first-in-class” and our proposed studies will afford optimized compounds with the best
balance of selective tumor targeting and anti-tumor efficacy, resulting from inhibition of SHMT2 and
downstream anabolic pathways. We anticipate developing SHMT2/DNP-targeted compounds for IND
submission and clinical trials based on our studies."
10747888,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core A: Administrative Core
This Administrative Core (Core A) will have two major functions. First, it will provide administrative support
and intellectual enrichment for the investigators in this Program. Due to the fact that the Program includes
five senior investigators from three institutions (UCSD, Salk, U Colorado), each in a different department,
Core A will be essential to integrate the disparate administrative hierarchies. Additionally three different
vertebrate species will be used for this work (human, mouse, frog), with the need to move animals between
institutions. Because of this, and because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the Program, a central
Administrative Core is essential. The Core will work closely with the administration of the three partner
institutions, as well as administrators, business managers, and scientists in each department involved. The
Administrative Core will: 1] Provide and encourage intellectual collaboration between members of the
Program Project, Internal and External Advisory Panels, university faculty who are not members of the
Project, and outside consultants. 2] Assist individual PIs in budgeting as well as coordinating travel,
purchasing, meetings, and seminars. The Core will achieve these objectives in several ways: 1] We will
support a Slack instant messaging/video portal for routine programmatic issues. 2] We will have monthly
two-hour seminars for all Program members in this program via video conference. 3] We will have
semiannual review by the Internal Advisory Group, and biennial Retreats by the External Advisory Group,
with presentation by each PI. We will also have the Directors of Core B and C present new data, analytical
techniques, and technological innovations, especially in the rapidly moving fields of genomics,
epigenomics, and bioinformatics. Seminars will average 10-12 per year, with each Project or Core
presenting 2-3 times per year. Internal and External Advisors are selected to advise each project
specifically and will work directly with his/her PI regarding their progress, to suggest possible new directions
for both the individual Projects, and potentially the overall Program. In addition, we propose to have two
whole day symposia during Year 2 and Year 4, overlapping with the External Advisory Group meetings, in
which will invite scientists whose work is on the same aspect of the research of each project. During these
symposia, each of the PI’s will present their progress over the preceding two years in the outside experts
will be asked to critically evaluate progress of each Project."
10747892,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core B: Epigenomics
The epigenetic modifications found in chromatin (DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of
histones) are involved in gene regulation during development and differentiation. Core B will generate
epigenomics data from massive parallel, multi-omic sequencing from human and mouse and xenopus
developing neural tube. The Core will identify gene regulatory elements and epigenomic variants having the
potential to cause or influence phenotypes. The Program PI and Director of Core B have worked together
extensively in the past with great success producing significant mouse neural tube epigenomic data. Dr. Ecker
has worked broadly in the area of genomics and epigenomics and in the development methodologies employing
multi-modal ‘multi-omics’ techniques for generation multiple types of NGS datasets from single cells. The data
generated from Core B, as well as imported from Project I, II and III, will be delivered to Core C for extraction of
results which will be delivered to each of the Projects for further validation. These goals will be accomplished by
developing the key pipelines of Core B that involve data production, and analysis: 1] Bulk whole genome
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) Pipeline. The Ecker lab published the first human methylome and thus has
significant expertise in the workflow for data production. Our data workflow was established, and standard
operating procedures developed and adopted, by the ENCODE project and will take advantage of the same
features of our WGBS workflow that has made it successful for that effort. 2] Single cell methylome
sequencing (snmC-seq) pipeline. The methods for production and analysis of single cell methylome data
snmC-seq2 and more recently snmC-seq3, were established and standard operating procedures develop for the
NIH BRAIN initiative. 3] Multi-omics analysis combining two different NGS datasets measured from single
cells. These include snMethyl-3C-seq, snPaired-seq and snMethyl-HiC. The Epigenomics Core and the
Bioinformatics Core will work together to perform analysis of all epigenomic data produced by Core B, will work
with existing pipelines or create new pipelines as need demands, and will share data the Projects I, II and III. We
anticipate that 25,000 single cell methylomes/yr will be generated, along with detailed analyses. Data processing
quantification of genome wide unmethylated and methylated cytosine base calls are generated using an
algorithm that we previously developed called Methylpy. Clustering of snmC-seq2 data for cell type classification
will utilize both mCG and mCH patterns to effectively classify both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the
developing neural tube. These analyses will result in a prioritized list of candidate marker features (genes and
predicted regulatory elements) that will be provided to the project PIs for further examination and validation."
10742932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mammalian inner, middle and outer ears have different embryonic origins, yet the development of
each component of the auditory apparatus must be precisely synchronized in space and time. Understanding
the mechanisms that regulate and co-ordinate the development of these structures is of central importance in
understanding the basis of the many birth defects that affect hearing. We have identified a Forkhead
transcription factor, Foxi3, that is expressed at very early stages in the embryonic head. Foxi3 mouse
mutants made in our lab lack all components of the inner, middle and external ears. Our work suggests
that one of the first steps in ear induction– the formation of the otic placode – does not occur in Foxi3 mutants.
Moreover, the mesenchyme of the first and second branchial arches that generate the middle ear ossicles and
the external ear begins to form in Foxi3 mutants, but rapidly succumbs to massive cell death. Moreover, we
have recently identified human patients with Foxi3 variants that have a variety of defects in their hearing
apparatus
 To our knowledge, Foxi3 is the only mammalian gene that causes a complete developmental failure of the
entire inner, middle and outer ears when mutated by itself. We are therefore extremely interested to
understand how Foxi3 orchestrates development of the auditory apparatus at both the cellular and molecular
levels. Our data suggests that Foxi3 may act as a “pioneer” transcription factor – its main function in addition to
initiating transcription is to epigenetically organize genomic loci containing ear-specific genes in a
transcriptionally competent state. Our first two aims will determine the function and mechanism of Foxi3 during
development of the inner ear using knockout mice, chick embryo manipulations and state-of-the-art ES cell
models, deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Our final aim focuses on the function the Foxi3 gene in
the development of the middle and external ear – here we will both study the effects of loss of Foxi3 in mice,
but also create mouse mutants that recapitulate the genetic variants seen in some of our human patients."
10747864,"The Undergraduate Research Education Program (Undergirding Potential Program: UP Program) in
Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) is a collaboration among the University of Michigan (Michigan),
Hampton University (Hampton), and Fisk University (Fisk) with the goal of increasing diversity in the EHS
research workforce and accelerating improvements in environmental quality and public health. Faculty from
Michigan's EHS Department (School of Public Health) with robust research programs on NIEHS priority areas
will mentor four undergraduate students per summer. Hampton and Fisk Universities are historically black
colleges and universities (HBCUs) with developing research interests in EHS among both faculty and students.
Students will be co-selected by Fisk, Hampton and Michigan UP Program leaders (Drs O'Neill, Charles,
Heyliger and Martin) and matched with faculty mentors. These faculty will also explore future research and
training collaborations in EHS across the institutions. Selected students must have completed two years in an
EHS-relevant baccalaureate degree program, in biology, chemistry, environmental sciences, physics,
engineering, or mathematics. Trainees will have summer research experiences at Michigan with continued
communications throughout the year. Topics for research projects include epigenetic and genomic impacts of
exposures, and human health aspects of environmental exposures (including cancer and other outcomes
associated with pesticides, heavy metals, components of plastics, air pollutants, and climate-related
exposures). The partnership between Michigan and the HBCUs will increase the HBCU student's interest in
EHS as a career and achieve the long-term goal of diversifying the EHS workforce by providing `early pipeline'
opportunities to underrepresented students in EHS. Students will receive both hands-on research experiences,
education, and skills needed to pursue graduate school and careers in EHS. Participants will receive up to two
summers of training and education, including a full-time summer mentored research experience in EHS at
Michigan, training in responsible conduct of research, educational activities, lectures, and group collaboration.
They will benefit from coordination with several existing undergraduate internship programs at Michigan, and
the EHS Environmental Toxicology and Epidemiology Program (ETEP) T32 training grant for pre- and post-
doctoral students, now in its 33rd year of NIEHS support. Trainees will have access to graduate students,
including those from under-represented backgrounds, with first-hand knowledge of the process and career
options. The Michigan-Hampton-Fisk UP Program R25 is structured to specifically meet the goals of: (1)
diversifying the EHS workforce and (2) advancing the NIEHS mission, and (3) enriching EHS scholarship and
training at all three universities."
10747868,"Exposure to chemicals present in the environment can induce epigenetic changes in paternal
sperm and affect risk of disease in offspring. This molecular memory of past exposures can be
transmitted between generations via sperm non-coding RNAs such miRNAs. Our long-term goals
to understand how parental environmental exposures can predispose children to diseases such
as diabetes and cancer aligns with aims in the NIEHS’ strategic planning. The pesticide
DDT(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is an environmental toxicant with endocrine disruptor
(EDC) activity. While banned from Western countries for over 30 years, DDT is a persistent
environmental pollutant that is still is detected in the American population, particularly in minorities
and recent immigrants. Currently, the major of source of this pesticide in the U.S. is food imported
from regions where DDT is used. Our preliminary data, generated in a mouse model, show that
pre-conception exposure to DDT alters miRNAs in paternal sperm. More importantly, paternal
DDT leads to low birth weight, a phenotype associated with reduced placenta and fetal size.
Offspring of DDT fathers show metabolic dysfunction and accelerated cancer growth. We
hypothesize that programming of offspring’s disease by pre-conception paternal DDT exposure
occurs via sperm miRNA which alters placenta development and fetal growth. We also
hypothesize that DDT exposure signals are relayed to sperm via extracellular vesicles secreted
by epididymal cells. Our hypothesis will be tested in a mouse model and in cell cultures by
focusing on the following aims: 1) To examine the mechanisms by which environmentally relevant
doses of DDT and its metabolite, DDE, alter the miRNA (and other small RNAs) content in
paternal sperm; 2) To characterize the mechanisms underlying alterations in placenta
development and function resulting from paternal DDT exposure; 3) To evaluate whether miRNAs
(and possibly other small RNAs) in sperm of DDT exposed males are mechanistically linked to
alterations in placenta and fetal development. While the evidence showing that paternal
exposures programs disease in offspring is robust, our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms is still lacking. Defining the mechanisms by which paternal exposure to DDT and
other EDCs can promote changes in fetal and placenta development is critical to identifying
preventive tools for disease such as diabetes and cancer. This study will also contribute the
general understanding of environmentally-induced non-genetic inheritance and could lead to
public health recommendations to men of reproductive age. Finally, our findings could lead to
potential placental biomarkers of parental exposure."
10734766,"Summary
A major gap in the “bench to bedside” paradigm is the ability to harness the glycome for the development of
novel therapeutics. Although decades of research in glycobiology have established glycomic changes associated
with disease, almost nothing is known about how those changes arise, the functions they play in disease initiation
or progression, or how the glycome is actually regulated. Based on provocative new data, we propose a
transformative new model for glycomic compositional regulation of soluble secreted glycoproteins that provides
a clear path for the development of the first generation of glycan-modulating therapies for a wide range of
diseases. The model is based on the notion that the glycans of glycoproteins can be remodeled after release
from the originating cell, and if correct, our findings will refute the glycobiology dogma in which glycomic changes
are dependent upon the slow process of protein turnover and de novo synthesis to one that is highly dynamic,
rapid, and specific to the immunologic environment. The proposal centers on the molecular action, regulation
and necessary microenvironment for ST6Gal1 to add α2,6-linked sialic acids onto glycans with available terminal
galactose residues. Our proposal also focuses upon the B cell-secreted glycoprotein/antibody IgG. This is a
critical pathway to understand because ST6Gal1 is the sole enzyme that determines whether anti-inflammatory
α2,6-sialyl-IgG or pro-inflammatory asialyl-IgG is produced at any given time, thereby making it a key
immunomodulatory factor. In Aim 1, we will dissect the enzymatic action of ST6Gal1 from hematopoietic cells
other than B cells during IgG production. In Aim 2, we will extend our studies to the microenvironment necessary
to support ST6Gal1 activity in modifying IgG sialylation. Even if our model for glycoprotein glycan remodeling is
limited to sialylation, such a pathway could influence immune pathways such as leukocyte trafficking, the
distinction between self and non-self by siglecs, synthesis of the ABO blood groups, transplantation, IgG
functionality and many others. Our findings could redefine the nature of the glycome as one under dynamic
regulation that could be therapeutically harnessed via the creation of an entirely new class of glycosylation-
altering drugs for the treatment of diseases ranging from inflammatory disorders and autoimmunity to cancer."
10755253,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an increasingly prevalent disease that currently
affects ~1.3% of adults in the US. IBD is characterized by chronic inflammatory immune responses directed
against the gut microbiota, and severely impedes the health of its sufferers. Current therapeutic approaches
involve neutralization of pathogenic inflammatory pathways. However, many patients are non-responsive or
become refractory to treatment, and the requirement for sustained administration of these agents can enhance
susceptibility to infection. A major unmet clinical need entails development of improved therapeutic regimens
that quell ongoing inflammation while sparing protective immunity. Strategies that seek to restore host immune-
gut microbiota homeostasis through introduction of health-promoting immunomodulatory microbes (probiotics),
represent an attractive alternative to blockade of immune function. To date, these approaches have demon-
strated limited efficacy. Our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms through which microbes induce anti-
inflammatory responses, and how transplanted microbes survive the hostile environment of the inflamed intes-
tine to establish a niche have severely hampered these efforts. An approach where the optimal features from
different microbes are combined, so-called designer probiotics, represents an improved treatment strategy.
Knowledge gap: The identity of the bacterial pathways that actively promote intestinal anti-inflammatory im-
mune responses and allow probiotic strains to colonize the inflamed intestine have remained enigmatic due to
microbiota complexity and difficulties associated with the genetic manipulation of gut microbes. Hypothesis:
Strain-specific differences impact the probiotic potential of gut bacterial species. Preliminary studies: Through
the study of distinct strains of the genetically tractable gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we have (i)
identified extensive strain-level variation in the ability of B. thetaiotaomicron strains to induce accumulation of
colonic Tregs in monocolonized gnotobiotic mice, (ii) revealed significant strain-level variation in the biofilm-
forming capacity of different strains of B. thetaiotaomicron, and (iii) uncovered the existence of a novel, B. the-
taiotaomicron-derived, immunomodulatory factor that promotes production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-
10. Our systems provide an opportunity to leverage the relatedness of strains within a species that impart dif-
ferential phenotypes to provide insight into pathways related to the optimal function of probiotics. Project ob-
jective: To leverage the strain-level variation and genetic tractability of B. thetaiotaomicron to define the bacte-
rial genes and molecules that most potently confer anti-inflammatory capacity to gut microbes. Impact: Results
of these studies will advance efforts to develop designer probiotic therapeutics that provide durable remission
from disease for IBD patients. Aim 1: Define the molecular basis for strain-level variation in bacterial driven
colonic Treg induction. Aim 2: Define the B. thetaiotaomicron-derived immunomodulatory factor(s) that limit
colitis. Aim 3: Define the genetic determinants mediating bacterial strain-level fitness in the inflamed intestine."
10752709,"Project Summary
More than half a million patients, including children, have benefitted from the remarkable technological
breakthrough that are cochlear implants (CI). An increasing number of patients have some level of residual
hearing at the time of implantation and can benefit from bimodal electro-acoustic devices. Surviving hair cell
activity and as a result a functioning organ of Corti and neural substrate has recently been linked to speech
perception outcomes. However, trauma during implantation leads to inflammation and oxidative stress that can
exacerbate residual hearing loss. Successful translation of therapeutic interventions to limit pathophysiology of
the injury have yet to be achieved. The present work will design and implement applications of localized,
therapeutic hypothermia for protection of hair cells and neural substrate following CI. The specific aims are
motivated by preliminary and published data showing that localized, mild hypothermia delivered to the cochlea
is highly effective and safe, protecting hair cells and synaptic components, protecting the integrity of the
cochlear blood-labyrinth barrier and preserving residual hearing long-term after implantation. Specific aim 1 will
test safety and efficacy of cooling when applied to the cochlea and develop an optimal protocol for improved
long-term functional and physiological outcomes. In specific aim 2 using molecular biology and
immunohistochemistry techniques we will define the neuroprotective mechanisms underlying hypothermia.
Combining the preclinical results with human cadaver temporal bone studies in specific aim 3, we will develop
a device and system for human application. The system will enable delivery of optimized hypothermia therapy
for residual structure and functional protection post-implant. Ensuring the survival of sensitive hair cells and
neural structures in the cochlea are likely to lead to improved speech perception outcomes and will enable

extended to other inner ear-related trauma such as ototoxicity, or noise- and blast-induced trauma."

With the advent of exome sequencing, a growing number of children are being identified with de novo loss of
function mutations in the large GTPase essential for mitochondrial fission - Dynamin Related Protein 1 (DRP1);
these mutations result in severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as developmental delay, optic atrophy,
and epileptic encephalopathies. Though it is established that mitochondrial fission is an essential precursor to
the rapidly changing metabolic needs of the developing cortex, it is not understood how identified mutations in
different domains of DRP1 uniquely disrupt this process. F-actin and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form a
complex to prime the mitochondria for fission by pre-constricting the mitochondrial membrane prior to formation
of DRP1 oligomers. The effect of DRP1 mutations on protein interactions with F-actin and the ER has never
been studied in cell types of the developing cortex. This proposal focuses on testing the mechanism of DRP1
dysfunction both on protein interactions at sites of fission as well as downstream effects on cortical neuron
differentiation and maturation. We aim to approach these gaps by leveraging the power of induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) harboring DRP1 mutations in either the GTPase or stalk domains to model cell-fate changes
associated with early cortical development. We will functionally assess the capacity for these iPSCs with mutant
DRP1 to adopt a neural progenitor fate and progress to active cortical neurons using quantitative analysis of
neurite outgrowth and branching, calcium transient recording, and synchronous synaptic firing. To understand
how mutant forms of DRP1 interact with F-actin and the ER during fission, we will use live super-resolution
Airyscan microscopy paired with in-cell immunoprecipitation to capture changes in the assembly and
disassembly of this fission machinery. Successful completion of these aims will improve our understanding of
the role of mitochondrial fission during cortical development and at which stages of this process perturbations
become highly pathogenic. Furthermore, these results could help shed light on variable patient symptoms and
outcomes based on specific DRP1 mutations, possibly leading to individualized therapeutics for mitochondrial
disease."
10773070,"The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of
cancer biology combined with new personalized therapies, the digital revolution, nanotechnology, big data
science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful information and
knowledge that could be extracted from imaging data, but is currently not fully accessible by clinicians and
hence cannot be optimally utilized for patient care, procedures or surgery. Medical care providers are
constantly inundated with increasing amounts of patient data (both relevant and not) which are increasing
in complexity. Cancer care exemplifies the current clinical challenges which include early detection,
accurate distinction of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, determining infiltrative tumor margins during
surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution and potential acquired resistance to treatments over
time, and prediction of tumor aggressiveness, metastasis pattern, and recurrence. Major strides have
been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy but the availability of
specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full
potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during medical/surgical
interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of imaging cancer to investigate the
microstructure and inherent heterogeneity, image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and
knowledge transfer are critical to inform and enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available,
especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to propose this revised P41
biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT or AT-NCIGT with 3 TRDs,
10 CP’s & 10 SPs. The 3 components, which we will investigate and develop new technology for are:
Imaging Cancer heterogenity, Deep Learning and Intraoperative devices for image guided therapy.
The BTRC will be organized with senior level experienced team led by the PI, assisted by TRD PI’s and
others. They will support all research activities, ensure CP/SP support and review and mentor junior
investigators and trainees. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop, and disseminate
novel advanced technologies such as new MR sequences for tissue characterization-Imaging Cancer
Heterogeneity (TR&D 1); analyze them and make them available through state-of-the- art algorithmic and
data curation approaches (Deep Learning TR&D 2); and development of a set of comprehensive
intraoperative planning, guidance and monitoring technologies and devices ( Intraoperative devices for
image guided therapy TR&D 3). We will disseminate all innovations and specific deliverables to the CPs
and SPs through the established mechanisms of the National Center for Image Guided Therapy
(NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the investigation of the technical needs of IGT."
10773073,"Project Summary
TRD 1: Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity
Precision medicine is a paradigm shift whereby personalized treatment approaches are based on knowledge of
an individual’s genotype and phenotype. While it is important to match the therapeutic agents to the genetic
makeup of a tumor, new strategies are needed to detect and optimally characterize the imaging phenotype of
tumors and definitively determine the tumor/no tumor borders to optimize patient-specific treatments. As such,
the role of imaging in assessing tumor heterogeneity and accurately characterizing those who will require
definitive therapy is critical. Using image guidance for precise mapping of tumor cell composition and accurate
3D mapping of brain, prostate, and gynecological tumor burden is the best approach to characterizing tumors
and guiding clinical management at diagnosis.
The goal of the Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity TRD is to develop and validate molecular, micro- and
macroscale imaging technologies to characterize the macroscopic and microscopic environment of tumors,
tumor heterogeneity and tumor volume, and improve risk assessment to guide the precise treatment of cancer.
While the initial studies will focus on brain, prostate, and gynecological neoplasms, we envision the technology
and findings derived from this TRD will be broadly applicable to a variety of cancers. Hence, the aims are
designed to provide novel and detailed mapping of tumor heterogeneity and define tumor borders using mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) correlated with histopathology and multiparametric MRI technologies."
10773078,"The goals of the Deep Learning TRD of the Advanced Technologies for the National Center for
Image-Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) are to investigate revolutionary advances in deep learning (DL) in
the context of image-guided therapy (IGT) of brain, prostate, and lung cancer, and to develop tools that
can be used by the broader IGT research community. The general theme of our research addresses
difficulties associated with creation of training data, which is a significant impediment to the application of
DL to medical images. While DL has had many successes in image-based classification or segmentation
tasks, the methods used are fully supervised, i.e., very large amounts of accurately annotated training
data are needed to achieve best performance. Currently, expert annotation is expensive and laborious in
the case of medical images because accurate segmentation of 3D structures requires manual or
semi-automatic labeling of thousands of voxels per image. Concurrently, large unlabeled or
weakly-labeled data sets are becoming available. For example, the PACS system of a large hospital
might contain tens of millions of scans, but determining accurate disease labels is difficult. There are
currently two promising DL approaches that can be used to address this problem, weakly-supervised
learning (where some labels are absent or otherwise imperfect) and transfer learning (which leverages
labeled data sets that are in some ways similar). The current situation is further exacerbated by a lack of
machine readable metadata, and of methods and tools to support curation of the imaging (e.g., Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI)) and clinical data, alongside annotations and analysis results within a single
data model. The latter leads to fragmentation of data, and non-standard and heterogeneous metadata.
We address these problems by 1) Developing new information theoretic technology for
weakly-supervised deep learning, 2) developing novel training strategies for deep learning for cancer
characterization for transperineal in-bore MRI-guided prostate biopsy, and 3) developing an infrastructure
for curating imaging data for deep learning. The results of this TRD will be DL algorithms, the resulting
models, and tools for annotation and organizing machine-readable metadata that are designed to enable
IGT cancer research for the prostate, the lung, and the brain applications."

 Recent advances in personalized medicine have been accompanied by increasing recognition
of image-guided interventions. Two critical needs have to be addressed before image-guided
intervention plays a key role in precision medicine – the successful application of imaging as a
predictive biomarker of therapeutic efficacy and the development of devices to identify, sample, and
monitor target tissues. The goal is to develop a set of intraoperative devices through synergistic
interactions of technical and biomedical expertise and deliver prototypic software tools/devices
enabled by 3D Slicer. Aim 1 Intraoperative needle guidance for prostate biopsy and ablation
We will
create, test, and validate image-guidance software to address needle deflection and provide an
optimal insertion path for in-bore MRI-guided biopsy and ablation of prostate cancer. This aim will
deliver a complete set of tools namely-a transperineal template with fine grid pattern and guidance
software that takes into account needle deflection. Aim 2. Development of an intraoperative
visualization and navigation for lung surgery. We will develop an augmented reality (AR)-guided
navigation system for laparoscopic lung surgery to be integrated with novel computer vision and
machine learning algorithms to compensate for lung deformation. We will also develop machine-
learning based feature descriptors to accurately track anatomical features from stereo laparoscopic
images. Aim 3: Technical development of an implantable microdevice with integrated retrieval
mechanism. We will develop new implantable microdevice (IMD) prototypes that have integrated
retrievability for difficult to access tissues such as the brain-within a focal tumor -each IMD contains
up to 20 individual wells for installation of drugs. We will use image guidance for optimal placement -
in the tumor, to allow focal and controlled release of these drugs and then image guided device
retrieval (removal). Once the image guided retrieval the IMD is removed with a “cuff” or rim of tissue,
this will undergo pathological analysis to discover if an adequate amount of tissue is present and then
analyzes of local tissue/tumor response. Collaborating projects will be benefitted by incorporating
novel and clinically tested devices and associated software made possible in the TRD 3."

Cannabis is the most commonly used substance among individuals who consume alcohol, but there is conflicting
evidence regarding the effects of cannabis on alcohol use and specific health outcomes. Furthermore,
physiological responses to long-term and regular use of these substances differ substantially. The present study
aims to investigate physiological and psychological differences across individuals with different patterns of
alcohol and cannabis use (individuals who exclusively and regularly use cannabis-only, alcohol-only, and
individuals who regularly use both alcohol and cannabis). The specific aims are to (1) investigate the effects of
regular cannabis and alcohol consumption on the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability in the three groups,
(2) examine baseline circulating levels of endocannabinoids and differences in relation to substance use
patterns, and (3) explore trait depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnoses among the three groups with
validated indices such as Beck’s depression and anxiety inventories. These aims will be tested through collection
of fecal and blood samples, as well as administration of several psychological assessments and substance use
questionnaires to individuals between the ages of 21-40 who regularly use alcohol or cannabis or a combination
of both. The current proposal is innovative in its multi-faceted approach to examining the effects of alcohol and
cannabis, and novel in its consideration of an endocannabinoid-microbiota-gut-brain axis. Structural equation
modeling will be used to investigate the aims, with data from an advanced biostatistics pipeline for microbiome
analysis. This proposal is designed to advance the candidate’s long-term goal of becoming an independent
scientist with advanced methodological and statistical knowledge that can be applied to clinical treatment of
substance use and mental health disorders. The training objectives are to (a) develop skills and knowledge to
bridge physiological processes and human psychopathology/behavior (alcohol and substance use, depression
and anxiety), (b) develop proficiency and applied expertise in human gut microbiome research and analysis, and
(c) develop competency and applied expertise in cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system research
(methodology and analysis). Foundational knowledge generated from this proposal will inform the candidate’s
future research directions and grant applications. The training will enable the candidate to become an innovative,

10731059,"Background. Over 70% of Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), seeking services at the Veterans’
Health Administration, suffer from comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These Veterans commonly
experience concomitant executive dysfunction in goal setting, concentration, and attention that impairs their
performance in complex daily tasks. Others and we have studied Goal Management Training (GMT) to
address this problem. Collectively, the data have shown that GMT improved some aspects of executive
function in mTBI/PTSD but did not restore cognition to normal during complex tasks. Goal management for
performing complex tasks requires cognitive processes such as attention, and direct-attention training may be
beneficial in improving cognition. GMT with attention training have been used in other studies, but those did not
involve Veterans with either mTBI or mTBI/PTSD. We recently conducted a pilot study combining GMT and
direct-attention training (GMT+ATT) in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD. We discovered a large treatment effect
(Cohen d=2.23) in the NIH EXAMINER Executive Composite score and a significant treatment response in the
NIH EXAMINER Cognitive Control subdomain and the Unstructured Task.
 GMT or ATT is typically administered in-person. In-person treatment can impose problems such as limited
treatment access, poor cost-effectiveness, and unexpected situations (like the COVID-19 pandemic). As an
alternative method, telehealth has been used increasingly to meet the need for care in Veterans living in rural
areas and during the pandemic. Telehealth delivery of cognitive interventions in Veterans with mTBI or with
PTSD has shown effectiveness that is comparable to that of in-person treatment. However, GMT+ATT has not
been studied in these Veterans. Therefore, we have recently developed the format for telehealth delivery of
GMT+ATT in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD. Our preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of this delivery
platform and similar treatment outcomes as compared to in-person therapy.
Objective & Hypotheses. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine and compare the
effect of in-person and telehealth delivery of GMT+ATT in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD.
Hypothesis 1a. In-person GMT+ATT will improve cognition vs. control group (Brain Health Workshop (BHW).
Hypothesis 1b. Telehealth GMT+ATT will improve cognition vs. BHW control group
Hypothesis 2. Telehealth delivery of GMT+ATT will produce response comparable to in-person treatment.
Primary measure. The NIH EXAMINER executive composite score will assess overall executive function with
subdomains such as complex task performance requiring goal management, as well as tests underlying
cognitive control such as attention and working memory. Secondary functional measures. 1) Unstructured Task
and 2) Test of Grocery Shopping Skills (ToGSS), which captures naturalistic real-world function. Exploratory
Objective. To study the capability of the Attention Network Task to predict treatment response to GMT+ATT.
Methods. 63 Veterans will be randomized to 10 weeks of in-person or telehealth delivery of GMT+ATT or
BHW control. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-, post-, 6 month-post and 1-year post-treatment. GMT and
ATT will each be provided in ten, weekly, 2-hour sessions (4hrs/week as combined).
Significance. This study uses a novel combinational treatment of GMT+ATT to restore the executive and
attentional processes required for complex daily tasks in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD. This work meets a key VA
RR&D priority of providing quality care to Veterans. Positive study results may help shape clinical practice of
cognitive rehabilitation in terms of treatment strategy, delivery platform, access to care, and means to predict
treatment response. Such impacts will translate to significant cost-savings for the VA healthcare system and
improvement in quality of life in Veterans."

 Late-life depression (LLD) increases risk for numerous poor health outcomes in aging, including medical
multi-morbidities, disability, and mortality. Importantly, LLD also doubles the risk for dementia relative to the
general aging population. Impairment in select cognitive domains (i.e., executive function) persists even after
remission of depressive symptoms in LLD. Lifestyle modification is currently the most promising non-
pharmacological approach for attenuating cognitive decline in aging and preventing dementia, yet has not been
used to target cognitive impairment in remitted LLD (rLLD). Aerobic exercise (AE) is a lifestyle factor that
enhances cognitive functioning, with pronounced benefits for executive functioning. AE also influences
neuroimaging markers of brain health in regions and networks critical for executive and memory function (i.e.,
prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, default-mode network). Critically, AE targets cognitive domains and brain
regions and networks showing the greatest and most persistent abnormalities in LLD.
 The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a methodologically rigorous AE trial using comprehensive
neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to assess the potential of AE training to 1) target systemic
brain abnormalities and 2) cognitive deficits; and 3) to explore the extent to which AE effects on neuroimaging
markers of brain health relate to its cognitive benefits in those with rLLD. In accordance with the NIMH
Experimental Therapeutics approach, this project proposes a 6-month randomized controlled trial comparing
moderate-intensity AE to a social engagement (SE) comparison condition, to examine the extent to which AE
training influences structural and functional systemic brain abnormalities observed in those with rLLD. The
secondary study aim is to examine the direct effect of AE training on cognitive function in those with rLLD. I will
also explore the relationship between AE-related brain changes and cognitive improvements to probe neural
mechanisms of AE effects on cognition in those with rLLD. The training provided through this award will include
1) building expertise in conducting laboratory- and home-based explanatory exercise interventions in geriatric
psychiatric populations; and learning 2) advanced 7T neuroimaging data analytic methods and 3) longitudinal
statistical analytic methods.
 In summary, this K23 study is the first step toward exploring biological mechanisms of the cognitive
remediating effects of AE in those with rLLD using an experimental therapeutics approach. The results of this
study will provide the necessary preliminary data to support the PI in her efforts to become an independent
clinical translational investigator in geriatric behavioral health."

 The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) occur in men and women ≥60 years of age. Changes
in the demographics of aging in the U.S. predict progressive increases in CVD without effective intervention.
Vascular dysfunction, including endothelial dysfunction as assessed by reduced endothelium-dependent
dilation (EDD) and stiffening of the large elastic arteries (i.e., aortic and carotid artery stiffening), is a major
mechanism of increased risk of CVD in older adults. Excess production of reactive oxygen species by
mitochondria (mtROS) has emerged as a central feature of vascular oxidative stress with aging and driver of
age-related vascular dysfunction. As such, identifying novel strategies to decrease mtROS and improve
vascular function, to ultimately reduce the risk of age-related CVD, is an important biomedical objective.
 MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that accumulates at the inner mitochondrial membrane where
it is optimally positioned to reduce mtROS. Preclinical findings from our laboratory showed that 4 weeks of
oral MitoQ supplementation completely restored EDD in old mice, ameliorated mtROS-associated
suppression of EDD, and was associated with reduced arterial mtROS, oxidative stress and improved
mitochondrial health. MitoQ therapy also reduced aortic stiffness in old mice. We recently took the first step
in translating these findings in a small pilot study of older adults (n=20). We found that supplementation with
MitoQ was well-tolerated, improved endothelial function and reduced plasma levels of oxidized low-density
lipoprotein, a circulating biomarker of oxidative stress. Consistent with our preclinical findings, preliminary
mechanistic assessments in subsets of our subjects suggest that improved endothelial function with MitoQ is
mediated by reduced endothelial cell mtROS production, associated reductions in tonic mtROS-related
suppression of EDD, and improved mitochondrial health, linked in part to changes in circulating factors in
the serum induced by chronic MitoQ supplementation. Lastly, MitoQ reduced aortic stiffness in older adults
who exhibited age-related aortic stiffening at baseline.
 Here we propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (PA-19-055) to establish
oral MitoQ (20 mg/day; MitoQ, Ltd.) for 6 months vs. placebo (n=56/group) for improving endothelial function in
older men and women (≥60 years), and determine the mechanisms by which MitoQ improves endothelial
function. We also propose to assess the effect of MitoQ on arterial stiffness.
Hypothesis 1: Oral MitoQ supplementation will improve vascular endothelial function in healthy older adults.
Hypothesis 2: Improvements in endothelial function with oral MitoQ supplementation in older adults will be
mediated by reduced mtROS-related suppression of EDD and associated with reduced endothelial cell ROS
production, vascular and systemic oxidative stress, and improved endothelial markers of mitochondrial health.
Hypothesis 3: Oral MitoQ supplementation will reduce arterial stiffness in older adults."
10751031,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a retinal neurodegenerative disease that is a major cause of vision loss
among the elderly worldwide. Although anti-VEGF treatments can be effective in the treatment of the neovascular
(“wet”) form of the disease, there are no proven and approved treatments for the more common atrophic (“dry”) form
of the disease. Greater understanding of the genetics and disease mechanisms underlying AMD has the potential to aid
in the development of more effective treatment strategies. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified a
large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with increased risk of AMD. Although these
GWAS studies have led to increased interest in the role of the complement system in AMD, the molecular mechanisms by
which AMD risk alleles lead to increased risk for the disease are poorly understood. Understanding AMD risk SNPs is
particularly challenging because most of them occur in non-coding regions of the genome. As one approach to this
problem, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) studies can identify SNPs that are likely to modulate downstream gene
expression. However, eQTLs do not provide information on SNP-binding proteins. Determining intersecting GWAS
SNPs with transcription factor (TF) binding sites by chromosomal immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is another
useful approach to identify functional SNPs and their interacting TFs, but this approach requires a priori knowledge of the
relevant TFs. In this application, using an approach that has not, to our knowledge, been previously applied to AMD
research, we propose to implement a Proteome-Wide Analysis of disease-associated SNPs (PWAS) study of non-protein
coding region SNPs to identify allele-specific protein-DNA interactions and alteration of regulatory activity in AMD. The
rationale for this approach is our hypothesis that functional AMD-related DNA SNPs likely execute their function via
allele-specific interactions with specific proteins. We will survey the entire human TF and RNA-binding protein
repertoires with SNP-carrying DNA probes using a protein array-based approach in which greater than 1,700 human
transcription factors (TFs)/DNA binding proteins can be simultaneously surveyed for each probe. Identified allele-specific
protein-DNA interactions will be prioritized using a series of bioinformatics analyses and validated using human retinal
pigment epithelial (RPE) and photoreceptor (PR) cells differentiated from human stem cells. In Aim 1 we will identify
TFs that show differential binding to allele-specific AMD-associated SNPs. Aim 2 will biochemically characterize and
prioritize the TFs identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will functionally characterize the identified AMD-SNP allele-specific protein
interactions in AMD-relevant cell types, and explore how they affect cell behavior and response to AMD-related stressors.
Taken together, we hope that these studies will provide new therapeutically relevant insights in the mechanisms
underlying the development and progression of AMD."
11138120,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Chronic musculoskeletal pain (pain > 3 months) is prevalent, costly, challenging to treat and a national priority area. Older
adults have the highest rates of chronic pain, and these are expected to increase given the growth of the older adult population
over the next three decades. Older adults from underserved communities (low SES, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants)
are at the highest risk for negative pain related health consequences such as lower physical and emotional function and
morbidity and mortality. We lack evidence based non-pharmacological treatments to address chronic pain within community
health clinics that serve this older adult patient population. GetActive is an evidence-based mind-body activity program that
directly targets improvement in pain outcomes by combining cognitive behavioral and mindfulness skills with gradual
increase in walking (preferred and safe activity for older adults) linked to valued activities. In direct response to RFA-NS-
22-002 we have partnered with the MGH-Revere HealthCare Center which serves >5,000 disadvantaged older adults, to
optimize GetActive to bypass socioecological barriers and effectively engage this population into non-pharmacological pain
management strategies. In the R61 phase, we will: 1) develop GetActive+ (optimized GetActive), 2) evaluate its feasibility
and acceptability; and 3) refine and finalize training, program manual, measures, and procedures. In the R33 phase, we will
conduct a randomized, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial (N=200) to evaluate effectiveness and
implementation of GetActive+ versus treatment as usual on the following outcomes: 1) self-reported physical function
(primary), 2) performance based (6MWT) and objective (step count) physical function, emotional function, pain, social
support, loneliness (secondary); and 3) feasibility, acceptability, fidelity and adoption at patient, provider and organization
levels (implementation). Through this project we aim to solve the problem of lack of evidence based nonpharmacological
treatments for older adults in underserved communities. GetActive+ delivered by clinic staff can be routinely incorporated
into group visits (already available at MGH-Revere HealthCare Center and other similar community centers) which are
billable, thus providing a sustained model of care for older adults with chronic pain from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Because GetActive incorporates mind-body skills with activity (e.g., walking), there is potential for improvement in other
outcomes (e.g., decreased risk for morbidity and mortality) over and above pain."
10802106,"Coronary artery is the leading cause of death in the US. While lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive drugs have
helped decrease CAD-related mortality by approximately 50% since the 1980s, these therapies only modify
CAD risk factors. To date, no approved drug acts at the vascular wall directly against atherosclerosis, the
underlying cause of CAD. One opportunity to develop novel therapies is through genetics: CAD is partially
heritable, and recent genome-wide association studies identified over 200 loci associated with elevated risk for
CAD. While 40% of these CAD loci having established associations with known risk factors, the molecular and
cellular mechanisms of the remaining 60% of the CAD loci are unknown. The majority of these unknown loci
are predicted to function by regulating gene expression in the vascular wall where the disease develops.
Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which make up the medial layer of arteries, play a critical role in the
progression of atherosclerosis, the precursor to coronary artery disease. During initiation and progression of
atherosclerosis, SMCs transdifferentiate from a quiescent (healthy) phenotype to a proliferative (pathological)
phenotype representative of myogenic, osteochondrogenic, and macrophage-like phenotypes that contribute to
plaque build-up. Identifying the molecular mechanisms driving SMC phenotypic plasticity will open up new
avenues of treatment for CAD. Preservation analysis of co-expression networks from RNAseq data generated
from the ascending aortas of 151 multi-ethnic smooth muscle cell donors cultured in quiescent and proliferative
conditions, respectively, revealed phenotype-specific network architecture enriched for nitrogen metabolic
processes. Previous studies have shown that metabolic pathways are not only involved in phenotypic changes
of other cell types in the vascular wall, but also have the capability to drive them. Therefore, the goal of this
proposal is to characterize the role nitrogen metabolism plays in SMC phenotypic plasticity and identify the key
regulatory genes driving dysregulation. The project will address this problem through 2 aims. In aim 1, I will
characterize the role nitrogen metabolism plays in SMCs during the progression of atherosclerosis using a
combined approach of metabolomics, cell type marker identification, and cellular phenotyping assays in
response to activation or silencing of the nitrogen metabolism pathway. In aim 2, I will create Bayesian
networks (BNs) of genes involved in nitrogen metabolic processes using gene expression data and
transcription factor-gene expression relationships generated from time-series experiments linking differentially
expressed ATACseq peaks and differentially expressed RNAseq peaks in response to pro-atherogenic
stimulus. I will then identify the key driver genes (KDs) of nitrogen metabolic pathways whose expression
regulates the changes across the gene expression networks. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments
for KDs in SMCs using lentiviral particles will be completed with cellular phenotyping assays to quantify the
impact on SMC proliferation, migration, and de-differentiation."

surveillance, and continuous hormone monitoring. Beyond enzymatic glucose sensors, electrochemical
aptamer based (EAB) sensors comprise the only other biosensing modality that has been broadly validated in
vivo. Despite demonstration of continuous sensing for over a dozen different analytes in animal models, no
EAB sensor has seen validation in human subjects due to lack of integration into deployable devices.
Therefore, a major need exists to bridge the gap between biosensor research and the type of devices needed
for real patient impact. We postulate that initial impact is particularly well-aligned with immediate needs for
high-frequency monitoring of drug and hormone concentrations in obstetric and pediatric populations, as
clinical trial data are often sparse with regard to these patients despite various physiological variations that can
lead to drastic interpatient variability in analyte concentrations.
Our central hypothesis is that through both device-oriented and novel signal-transduction innovations, EAB
sensors can achieve the performance needed to translate them from the research bench to a format that is
clinically deployable for point-of-care and/or continuous biosensing. Specifically, we postulate that
advancements in shelf storage, off-the-shelf stability, sensor interrogation, and sensor protection will allow EAB
sensors to be characterized and validated in integrated devices suitable for human subject testing.
We plan to pursue validation of our central hypothesis by (1) in vitro validating EAB sensors operating in an at-
home test strip format, (2) demonstrating the continuous operation of EAB sensors in a wearable device for >1
week and (3) validating these integrated devices in human subjects for model EAB sensors targeting the
narrow therapeutic index antibiotic vancomycin. This proposal will usher in the long-awaited validation of EAB
sensors for the on-demand monitoring of analytes in human subjects, serving as a foundation for further
clinical adoption of this sensing modality as the technology developed here is expanded to other analytes and
applications in personalized medicine."
10752609,"Background: Severe mental illnesses are consistently ranked as some of the most debilitating health conditions
worldwide due to their early age of onset, chronicity, and impact on functioning. Fortunately, a number of
antipsychotic medications have been found to be effective for managing the symptoms of severe mental illness
(SMI) and for preventing relapse and rehospitalization. Despite their efficacy, treatment non-compliance for
individuals on these medications is high due to a number of factors including poor insight into illness, negative
attitudes about medication, and medication related side effects. Further complicating care and outcomes for this
clinical population, providers must maintain close oversight of patients on antipsychotics due to the impact of
these medications on metabolic and cardiac functioning which confer an increased risk of obesity, diabetes,
heart problems, and other chronic illnesses. This oversight includes regular monitoring of weight, blood pressure,
fasting blood glucose, and lipid levels. Additionally, clozapine, indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia,
requires weekly-to-monthly monitoring of absolute neutrophil counts to prevent potentially fatal clozapine-
induced agranulocytosis. Significance: The proposed project has significant and immediate relevance to
Veterans and the VHA in that it seeks to better understand if and to what extent COVID-19 related care
disruptions impacted care and outcomes for Veterans with SMI prescribed antipsychotic medications. Given pre-
existing challenges in the treatment of this Veteran population, this is an important area of inquiry as well as one
for which little is known. Added strengths of the proposed study include the use of a mixed methods approach
that includes national level data from multiple sources. Aside from addressing a critical knowledge gap, the
proposed study targets what is unarguably one of the most vulnerable patient populations within the VA and
other healthcare systems—patients with SMI prescribed antipsychotic medications. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To
assess the impact of COVID-19 related care disruptions on healthcare use and outcomes for Veterans on
antipsychotic medications using robust statistical methods and national level data; Aim 2: To assess whether the
impact of COVID-19 related care disruptions differ by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and rural/urban status using
national level data; Aim 3: To conduct thematic interviews with provider and patient stakeholder groups at the
national level to better understand COVID-19 related care disruptions. Provider stakeholders (e.g., psychiatrists,
advanced nurse practitioners) will be interviewed to better understand COVID-19 related changes in practice
behaviors, the perceived impact of these changes on care continuity and outcomes, and to solicit suggestions
to mitigate the impact of interrupted care in the future; Veterans prescribed antipsychotic medication
prescriptions in the pre COVID-19 window will be interviewed to better understand the impact of COVID-19
related care disruptions on treatment seeking behaviors, obstacles encountered with regard to access, and to
explore other factors potentially impacting outcomes in this patient group. Methodology: The proposed study
will employ a mixed-methods (quantitative/qualitative) approach. For Aims 1 & 2 we will employ retrospective,
observational analyses using a national cohort of Veterans (N>250,000) with an ICD-CM-10 diagnostic code for
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder prescribed a first-generation or second-generation antipsychotic [1/19-12/21].
Veterans of all ages, genders, racial groups, military eras will be included in the cohort. Aim 3 will involve
individual thematic interviews with provider (n=35-45) and patient stakeholders (n=50-60). Next
Steps/Implementation: Findings from this 2-year project will be of immediate relevance and impact for local,
regional, and national level administrators and mental health providers as well as the VA Office of Mental Health
and Suicide Prevention and VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services. Collectively, data from this project
will serve to identify potential strategies to further mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the care and outcomes of
Veterans with SMI as well as prepare for future public health and/or other national emergencies."
11009267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic pain (CP) is one of the most common and debilitating medical conditions resulting in substantial
morbidity, lower quality of life and tremendous health care costs. With ongoing and tragic consequences,
opioids were overprescribed creating a surge in opioid use disorders and overdose deaths. Although non-
pharmacologic interventions have a strong evidence base, these interventions are rarely available and
expensive. The common co-morbidities of psychiatric and substance use disorders trigger further stigma and
lower quality care.
 Subjective reports of pain symptoms and the cultural meanings ascribed to them create a situation ripe for
health care disparities driven by multilevel biases on individual, provider, and systemic levels. These biases
are manifested in stigmatizing language and the denial of interventions to reduce pain and alleviate suffering.
Multiple studies have shown that racial and ethnic minorities with CP are especially mistreated. It is essential to
accelerate the creation of hybrid CP management programs that improve access to treatments while
simultaneously addressing the stigma, bias, and mistrust that further harm and isolate patients with CP.
 The INSPIRE CP intervention creates a hybrid blend of tailored cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical
therapy, mindfulness, and pain education delivered via a trilingual mobile app and supported by a telehealth
pain coach providing essential care coordination with PCPs within the EHR. PROs for pain, depression,
anxiety, substance use, and a range of social risks and needs will be regularly collected, summarized in the
coaching dashboard, and shared with PCPs. The intervention builds on an existing, in person pain program for
marginalized patients but significantly improves reach, expands cultural and linguistic adaptations, and directly
addresses multilevel bias and stigma through intensive community engagement, individual and group support,
and the provision of “tech tutoring” to improve digital health literacy.
 The two year R61 development phase includes 3 specific aims with matched milestones: 1) creation of the
digital tool and coaching protocol using intensive community engagement, 2) iterative development of
educational and implementation strategies for health care staff and providers, and 3) a 3 month pilot test to
further assess acceptability and feasibility. The three year R33 validation phase includes 3 additional specific
aims 1) perform a pragmatic RCT with n=586 patients comparing INSPIRE to enhanced usual care, 2) analyze
secondary outcomes and the treatment effects model, and 3) a mixed method evaluation of implementation
outcomes using Normalization Process Theory to better design strategies for future scale."
10831949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescence is a “vulnerable” period because certain experiences in this period lead to detrimental lasting
effects. A critical example is teenage drinking which may predispose them to life-long adverse consequences
including impulsivity and impaired response inhibition. In this exploratory R21 application, we propose to
exploit a rodent behavioral model to begin to understand the neuronal basis of the long-term consequences of
voluntary adolescent drinking on response inhibition. Using a novel behavioral task, we find that moderate
voluntary intake of alcohol during adolescence causes a robust reduction in response inhibition in both male
and female adult rats. Guided by basic and clinical literature suggesting that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
dorsal striatum (DS) are critical for action-guided learning and impulsivity, we propose two exploratory aims to
begin to understand the computational and circuit-based involvement of these two regions in mediating or
modulating impaired response inhibition in adults with a history of adolescent alcohol drinking. In Aim 1, we will
record from multiple units and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously in lateral OFC and medial DS during
task performance to determine if neural encoding of relevant task events and OFC-DS coordinated activity is
affected in correlation with behavioral changes. In Aim 2, we will use a chemogenetic approach to manipulate
OFC-DS connections to determine the potential causative role of this pathway on the sustained impact of
adolescent alcohol use on adult impulsivity. Regardless of the outcome, completion of this exploratory work will
provide technical and mechanistic knowledge to support future more comprehensive studies on the neuronal
basis of the lasting impact of adolescent alcohol use."

Precision medicine aims to accurately classify patients to improve diagnosis, intervention
selection, and prognosis. The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) collects a diverse array of
data types from participants, including surveys, electronic health records (EHRs), physical
measurements, wearable devices, and biosamples, offering valuable insights into health
trajectories. However, certain aspects of a patient’s life remain unrepresented in the collected
data, which can limit the accuracy of research and care. To address this gap, we propose the
creation of the All of Us Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD) to supplement
existing data sources using passive data streams and deploy integration strategies to ""put the
patient back together again."" This team brings together collective experience leading large
initiatives involving data acquisition, linkage, harmonization, quality assurance, pipelines and
platforms, governance, and security.
We will design and implement a data collection, linkage, and integration strategy that lays a
foundation for a variety of AoURP data linkages for identified, and de-identified data
integration, including person-level linkages such as with mortality, residential history, and
administrative claims, and geocoded data pipelines to enable linkages with the Environmental
Justice Index. The CLAD will acquire and process new data linkages and geocoded data in a
cloud-based Data Linkage Platform (DLP), guided by our experience formulating
researcher-ready datasets with scientific utility. Our CLAD team will perform data quality
assurance, repair, and standardization checks to ensure accuracy and robustness of data-driven
research. This endeavor will align data with interoperability standards and clinical terminologies,
extend them where necessary, and create a data quality dashboard for every data change and data
health check Data Quality reports for each of the sources and sites. We will also explore new
methods of clinical data acquisition from HINs to mitigate data missingness with a focus on
underrepresented populations by comparing AoURP participant-linked ambulatory EHR data
from OCHIN, which includes Medicaid and uninsured patients, with EHR data from health
systems served by Datavant. Diverse CLAD sources and novel analytical methods, such as
probabilistic models, will be used to reveal patterns of care and potential interventions for
communities underrepresented in biomedical research."
10757655,"SUMMARY
The dysregulation of mitochondrial networks responsible for maintaining normal metabolism is an
established hallmark of cancer and an early event in tumorigenesis. The disruption of cell metabolism
leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers maladaptive signaling that
disrupts metabolic balance, which can establish a tumorigenic and/or therapy resistant phenotype.
In this regard, a subgroup of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast malignancies, which exhibit
increased ROS levels and a high risk of recurrence due to endocrine therapy, has been identified.
We recently found a novel mitochondrial signaling axis centered on manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD), which when the acetylation (Ac) status of lysine 68 (K68-Ac) is altered, disrupts
cell metabolism, leading to aberrant ROS levels (Zhu, Nature Commun., 2019). In addition, breast
cancer cells expressing a MnSOD-K68-Ac mimic mutant (MnSODK68Q) exhibited increased HIF2α
(known to promote stemness-like properties), increased SOX2 and Oct4 (two established stem cell
biomarkers), leading to oncogenicity and pan resistance phenotype (PanR) to agents commonly
used in luminal B breast malignancies-implying that disruption of cell metabolism reprograms tumors
to exhibit a lineage plasticity phenotype. Based on our new data, our recent publication (Zhu et al,
Nature Commun. 2019), and work by others, it is hypothesized that dysregulated MnSOD biology,
due to aberrant/increased MnSOD-K68-Ac levels, disrupts normal cellular and mitochondrial
metabolism. This initiates metabolic reprogramming, via increased levels of HIF2α, leading to a cell
stemness-mediated tumor-permissive and/or PanR phenotype. Thus, we seek to further explore how
MnSOD-K68-Ac disrupts cell metabolism and promotes a stemness-like phenotype, leading to
oncogenicity and/or PanR. Finally, will GC4419 exposure, a chemical SOD detoxification mimic,
reverse the oncogenic and/or PanR phenotypes?"
10767814,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common psychiatric service-connected
condition among women Veterans, yet many women Veterans do not receive evidence-based psychotherapies
for PTSD. PTSD and insomnia disorder are highly comorbid in women Veterans and research suggests that
insomnia is a risk factor for PTSD development and severity, while healthy sleep is associated with improved
mood, daytime functioning, enhanced learning, and increased emotion regulation. Addressing insomnia
symptoms in women Veterans may offer an early point of intervention to reduce insomnia and some PTSD
symptoms, while also providing a novel approach to improve patient engagement in PTSD treatments.
Significance/Impact: Women's health and mental health (specifically PTSD) are research priority areas for
VA. Women Veterans experience multiple barriers to PTSD treatments including: perceived stigma, severity of
symptoms/emotion dysregulation, and scheduling/time constraints. Providers report delaying PTSD treatments
due to perceptions of patients' “unreadiness” to begin PTSD treatments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
Insomnia (CBT-I; first-line treatment for insomnia) is perceived as highly acceptable to women Veterans,
improves sleep in individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions, offers a brief intervention alternative to
psychotherapy protocols for PTSD, and is widely disseminated within VA.
Innovation: No previous studies have examined the impact of trauma-informed CBT-I on sleep and psychiatric
symptoms among women Veterans with comorbid insomnia disorder and PTSD. The project will utilize a mixed
methods approach, gathering novel information from women Veterans to identify facilitators of and barriers to
PTSD and insomnia treatments among women Veterans. While there are indications that CBT-I may serve as
a preparatory treatment to other evidence-based psychotherapies, this would be the first study to utilize a
trauma-informed CBT-I protocol and examine mental health treatment engagement as a primary outcome.
Specific Aims: The specific aims are to: 1) Iteratively refine the structure and materials of trauma-informed
CBT-I in preparation for a pilot trial, 2) Pilot test the effects of trauma-informed CBT-I on PTSD treatment
readiness and engagement in a sample of women Veterans, and 3) Examine potential mechanisms
underlying variations in PTSD treatment readiness and engagement over time among women Veterans.
Methodology: The proposed project will be carried out within VAGLAHS. In Aim 1, women Veterans will
sequentially receive the trauma-informed CBT-I protocol. We will obtain qualitative feedback from each
participant, and make needed refinements before administering the protocol to the next participant (anticipated
n=5). In Aim 2, women Veterans with comorbid insomnia disorder and PTSD will be recruited to participate in
a behavioral intervention study and eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either trauma-informed
CBT-I (n=25) or PTSD psychoeducation modeled after usual care (n=25). Participants will complete measures
of sleep, mental health symptoms, and PTSD treatment readiness at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month
follow-up. All participants will be offered a referral to PTSD treatment and treatment engagement will be
assessed at 6-month follow-up. In Aim 3, as part of the pilot trial, we will assess known barriers to PTSD
treatment engagement at each time point. We will conduct qualitative interviews with pilot trial completers and
non-completers (anticipated n=20) to better understand the processes underlying PTSD treatment readiness
and engagement among women Veterans with comorbid insomnia and PTSD.
Next Steps/Implementation: Findings will directly inform patient care by increasing treatment choices for
women Veterans who are not yet ready to begin PTSD treatment. Findings will also generate preliminary data
to inform future VA Merit Award applications involving an effectiveness trial of trauma-informed CBT-I and
mixed methods to examine treatment preferences among women Veterans with insomnia and PTSD."
10832967,"Among youth, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) represent two of the top ten causes
of disability and confer heightened risk of suicide. Since BD often initially presents as a MDD episode, youth with
BD are frequently misdiagnosed and thus receive ineffective treatment. Family history of mood disorders is a
robust predictor of early-onset MDD and BD as well as other psychiatric disorders. Prior studies have identified
neurobiological differences between healthy youth at high familial risk for BD or MDD relative to low familial risk,
and one study has identified neural circuit differences between youth at high familial risk for BD versus MDD.
Relatedly, there is preliminary evidence for neural markers that predict later onset of psychopathology among
youth at high familial risk for BD and MDD. These studies suggest that there are markers of vulnerability that
can be detected in the brain, prior to symptom onset, which may further increase risk for poor mental health
outcomes among these susceptible youth. However, extant research has been limited by small sample sizes
and a lack of multiple longitudinal symptom measurements over time, which have hindered the identification of
robust biomarkers that distinguish risk profiles among youth with a family history of BD versus MDD. The
identification of brain-based signatures of BD and MDD risk in youth would advance understanding of distinct
mechanisms underlying heightened vulnerability, which may ultimately inform approaches for earlier and more
accurate identification of these disorders. The present study aims to uncover unique neurobiological profiles of
high familial risk for BD and MDD among healthy youth, and to investigate whether these biomarkers predict the
subsequent onset and longitudinal course of psychopathology across adolescence. This study will include
healthy youth at low (LR, n=3,915) or high familial risk for MDD (HR-MDD, n=1,564) or BD (HR-BD, n=407) with
longitudinal data up to 3 years, derived from the landmark Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
Study. Aim 1 will examine dissociable patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in emotion- and
reward-related networks at baseline between healthy HR-BD, HR-MDD, and LR youth, using a whole-brain seed-
to-voxel approach with the amygdala, ventral striatum, and dorsal striatum as seed regions of interest. Aim 2
will ascertain longitudinal trajectories of dimensional psychiatric symptoms across adolescence over 3 years in
high familial risk youth using group-based trajectory modeling. Aim 3 will investigate whether alterations in
baseline FC within emotion- and reward-related networks predicts the presence of a clinical diagnosis in later
adolescence and/or a more severe longitudinal course of dimensional symptoms across adolescence. This
research will reveal critical insight into the mechanisms that contribute to risk versus resilience in vulnerable
youth, potentially serving as key biological targets for interventions. This knowledge may also potentially inform
early detection and intervention programs, which will help to alleviate the immense burden of BD and MDD."
10819126,"Project Summary
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Lung tumors driven by mutant KRAS
are among the most aggressive and refractory to treatment, due in part by KRAS-driven metabolic
reprogramming. Efforts to better understand the pathways regulating metabolic adaptations in oncogenic KRAS-
driven tumors will provide insight into lung cancer progression and identify vulnerabilities that could be
therapeutically targeted to improve patient survival. The Shaw lab recently showed the requirement of AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote the growth of oncogenic KRAS-driven non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). AMPK is a master regulator of cellular and organismal metabolism that acts as a sensor of cellular
energy by altering metabolism when energy levels are low. While the Shaw lab and others have demonstrated
that AMPK signaling provides cancer cells with flexibility to adapt to metabolic stresses, the epigenetic
mechanisms by which AMPK promotes metabolic alterations and lung tumor growth remain poorly understood.
Preliminary studies identified a de novo DNA methyltransferase as a novel substrate of AMPK. DNA methylation
is involved in many normal cellular processes and is abnormally distributed in cancer cells, contributing to some
of their aggressive characteristics. This proposal addresses the consequences of AMPK-dependent regulation
of the de novo DNA methyltransferase on DNA methylation, metabolic programs, and lung tumor growth. First,
this work aims to define the methylation profile controlled by the AMPK-dependent phosphorylated form of the
de novo DNA methyltransferase using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, CUT&TAG, and RNA sequencing
assays. Tumorigenicity and Seahorse real-time cell metabolic analyses will determine whether this regulation
disrupts DNA methylation patterns in a manner that generates tumor-promoting epigenetic lesions and metabolic
alterations. Additionally, the generation of autochthonous KRAS-driven NSCLC mouse lines expressing
constitutive knock-in of the de novo DNA methyltransferase with a serine-to-alanine mutation at the putative
phosphor-acceptor-serine will enable testing whether regulation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase impacts
tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. This work addresses a fundamental relationship between two hallmarks
of cancer and if successful would lead to the mechanistic connection between metabolic stresses tumor cells
face and how they may trigger sustained DNA methylation changes."

The University of Pennsylvania HIV Clinical Trials Unit (Penn HIV CTU) will build on its current infrastructure
and further its commitment to provide scientific leadership to advance the science of HIV treatment and
prevention within three HIV Clinical Research Networks, the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), the HIV
Vaccine Trials Group (HVTN), and the HIV Prevention Trials Group (HPTN). The Penn HIV CTU features an
integrated, efficient clinical trials organization with two clinical research sites (CRS), the Penn Therapeutics
CRS, located on the Penn School of Medicine (PSOM) campus, that conducts ACTG trials; and the Penn
Prevention CRS, separately located on the Penn campus, that conducts HVTN and HPTN supported trials.
Penn investigators will continue to contribute to the scientific agendas of these Networks through participation
on network committees and through submission of protocols and membership on protocol teams. In addition,
the Penn HIV CTU will advance the research agendas of these Networks through the cost efficient
implementation of clinical trials to improve the lives of people living with HIV infection and to prevent it among
those at risk. The leadership of the Penn HIV CTU will mentor the next generation of clinical investigators by
involving junior investigators at our site and elsewhere in activities at that promote their career development at
both the Network and site level. Penn investigators will engage the local community affected by HIV when
formulating priorities, we will inform the community about opportunities to participate in research, and educate
the community about medical advances and opportunities to access them. Penn investigators have
contributed to important advances in HIV therapeutics through the evaluation of strategies designed to control
HIV replication in the absence of antiretrovirals and purge the latent reservoir, testing of novel agents to inhibit
HIV replication, and by improving treatments and prevention of co-morbid conditions associated with HIV
infection. Penn investigators have also contributed to advances in HIV prevention through the testing of HIV
vaccines, long-acting antiretrovirals and monoclonal antibodies for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and through
behavioral interventions designed to modify risk behaviors. It is our goal to make these advances available to
all populations living with or at-risk for HIV infection, including men who have sex with men, cisgender women,
transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, and persons who inject drugs. Given the resources,
vision, and commitment of Penn investigators, the Penn HIV CTU is well positioned to support the initiative for
Ending the HIV Epidemic in Philadelphia, a priority city, through achievements in HIV prevention, diagnosis,

10739320,"This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support Dr. Croft's
advancement as a physician-researcher studying the effects of air pollution on the immune response to
respiratory viral infection (RVI). Specifically, Dr. Croft's proposed study provides an opportunity for mentored
development in advanced environmental epidemiology approaches, exposure assessment, immune system
transcriptomics, and research team management. RVIs are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in
adults. PM2.5 and combustion related air pollution (black carbon: a marker of traffic pollution) have been linked
to an increased rate of hospitalizations for RVI. However, the immune mechanisms by which air pollution may
enhance susceptibility to severe RVIs (i.e. requiring hospitalization) in adults remains unclear. Dr. Croft's
overarching hypothesis is that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution increases the risk of a severe
documented respiratory viral infection in adults, by disrupting key gene pathways (e.g. NF-κB and IFN-γ) within
the innate immune response. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Croft will enroll patients hospitalized with rigorously
adjudicated, microbiologically proven RVI from an active R01 study on improved diagnostics for respiratory
infection. In this population of patients with RVI, he will then lead analyses to explore whether short-term
increases in multiple air pollutant and source-specific pollutant concentrations are associated with an increased
rate of hospitalization for specific RVIs (e.g. influenza or respiratory syncytial virus). In the same population of
patients, he will determine whether these pollutant exposures are associated with activation or suppression of
key innate immune pathways. Specifically, using a population of patients with clinically adjudicated diagnoses
of RVI, his study will use a case-crossover design to estimate the rate of RVI hospitalizations associated with
acute increases in the concentration of particulate and gaseous pollutants in the prior 28 days (Aim 1). Patients
with confirmed infection will undergo RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood, allowing Dr. Croft to also
examine the association between the same short-term increases in pollutant concentrations and gene
expression within the innate immune system (Aim 2). In both aims, we will determine whether this response
may be sex-specific, race or ethnicity specific or unique in patients with COPD or asthma. This study may
immediately benefit the clinical counseling of patients with exposure to air pollution and may also help guide
future air quality policies to minimize the risk to populations vulnerable to RVI. Finally, the study results will
provide valuable data upon which to base a future prospective study of the effects of air pollution on respiratory
infection and innate immunity. His mentors include experts in environmental epidemiology (David Rich, ScD),
virology (Ann Falsey, MD) and transcriptomics (Thomas Mariani, PhD). Dr. Croft's highly productive mentor
team, including multiple content specific mentors, will help support his development into an independent
investigator pursuing clinical research on the respiratory health effects of inhaled toxins."

10747403,"Project Summary
Nearly all ovarian cancer deaths result from platinum-resistant high-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma
(HGSC), which typically responds poorly to PARP inhibitors, other “targeted therapies,” conventional
chemotherapy, and/or immune checkpoint blockade. Approximately 20% of HGSC is driven by CCNE1
amplification (CCNE1amp), which almost always leads to platinum resistance. This MPI application joins experts
in cancer biology/signal transduction/mouse modeling (NEEL) and HGSC genomics/therapeutics (LEVINE)
with the overall objective of improving treatment of this poorly responsive subgroup. We contend that achieving
this goal will require detailed analysis of sophisticated, genetically informed, immune-competent models of
CCNE1amp HGSC. To this end, we developed a novel, mouse fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) organoid platform
that can be used for rapid modeling of combinations of the genetic defects seen in human HGSC, as well as
organoid and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of normal FTE and human CCNE1amp HGSC. In work
under review, we found that Brca1-deleted, Ccne1-overexpressing (Ccne1OE), and Pten/Nf1-deleted FTE
organoids differ in proliferation/differentiation, cytokine/chemokine secretion, and drug response in vitro, and
evoke tumors with distinct kinetics, transcriptomes, and tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) upon
orthotopic injection (ovarian bursa) into syngeneic mice. Based on this information, we devised a chemo-
immunotherapy regimen that yields T cell-dependent, durable, apparently curative, complete responses (CR) in
a highly aggressive Tp53-/-;Ccne1OE;Akt2OE;KrasOE HGSC model. We now propose to: (i) clarify the mechanistic
of efficacy of this combination regimen, (b) determine the effects of other mutational events that co-occur
frequently with CCNE1amp on the phenotype of Tp53-/-;Ccne1OE FTE in vitro and in vivo, including whether our
combination regimen is broadly efficacious in Ccne1OE HGSC, and (c) assess the relevance of these findings in
human organoid and PDX models of CCNE1amp HGSC."
10788307,"SUMMARY
 Exploiting immunity to eliminate cancer cells offers tremendous new therapeutic opportunities, including the
widely employed immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agents. These approaches are challenged, however, by
the multitude of mechanisms through which tumors can suppress anti-tumor immunity and render them effective
in only a portion of patients. We have shown that effector T cells require high rates of glucose uptake for anabolic
metabolism, and it is now apparent that cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) disrupt anti-tumor
immunity in part through metabolic immune suppression. To address this barrier to immunotherapy, we
examined tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from surgically excised samples of human clear cell Renal Cell
Carcinoma (ccRCC), a cancer with moderate rates of ICB response that is characterized by loss of the Von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. These tumors allowed us to show that both glucose and glutamine are
available in the TME and while glucose metabolism promotes effector T cells, metabolism of glutamine restrains
T cell effector function. It is unclear which glutamine-dependent enzymes or metabolites suppress T cells, but
we found that Glutaminase-deficiency altered histone methylation and reduced expression of Pik3ip3, a PI3K-
inhibitory protein that suppresses PI3K/mTORC1 signaling and production of inflammatory effector cytokines.
To further explore mechanisms of T cell suppression by glutamine, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in
primary TIL and found loss of Glutamine Synthetase among all glutamine-metabolizing enzymes to most
effectively increase TIL accumulation. We also directly defined cell type-specific glucose and glutamine usage
in the TME using radiolabeled Positron Emission Tomography tracers. In contrast to classic Warburg
metabolism, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) were the dominant consumers of glucose, followed by TIL,
and cancer cells, which instead preferentially consumed glutamine. Interestingly, loss of Vhl did not increase
glucose uptake of RCC cells in vivo but instead increased glucose uptake in TIL and TAM. To explore these
pathways in patients undergoing ICB therapy, we next performed high dimensional CyTOF analyses of
peripheral blood from a longitudinal cohort of patients before and 3 weeks after start of therapy. This approach
specifically identified rare but highly proliferative ICB-responsive CD8 and CD4 T cells with elevated
mitochondrial potential. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that RCC genetics drive a metabolically
immunosuppressive TME with abundant glutamine that suppresses PI3K signaling to impair T cell
effector differentiation and function. We will study primary human ccRCC tumors and mouse RCC models to:
(1) Test how nutrients in the ccRCC TME and tumor genetics influence TIL function and metabolism; and (2)
Determine how glucose and glutamine metabolism in the TME promote or suppress anti-tumor immunity.
Together, these studies will establish mechanisms by which glutamine impairs T cell differentiation and test new
potential targets to overcome metabolic immune suppression in the TME to improve anti-tumor immunity."
10755681,"This mid-career development award application is designed to provide critical protected time for the applicant to
increase and improve his mentoring activities along with further developing his research program in clinically
oriented translational research in vascular biology and endothelial function. During his 12+ years as a faculty
member, the applicant has served as research mentor for 17 post-doctoral mentees, including 10 physician-
scientists. Nearly 90% percent of the applicant's mentees engaged in patient-oriented research, nearly 50%
percent are women, and 82% have remained in academic medicine settings. As part of this program, the
applicant will create a more detailed and structured mentorship program for his trainees who are interested in
careers in patient-oriented clinical/translational research in vascular biology and physiology. This K24 application
is scientifically centered on determining the vascular and inflammatory impact of supplementation of humans
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v). This proposal represents
a natural outgrowth of the applicant's current work. Despite aggressive traditional risk factor modification and
glycemic control efforts with even the most recent glycemic control agents with favorable cardiovascular profiles,
atherosclerotic vascular diseases and microvascular disease continue to disproportionately impact individuals
with diabetes mellitus (DM). Vascular disease in T2DM begins with the development of vascular endothelial
dysfunction. The applicant's group recently reported that once daily supplementation with Lp299v results in
improved endothelial function and reduced systemic vascular inflammation in men with stable coronary artery
disease. This was the first report of a probiotic supplement having a favorable impact on vascular endothelial
function in humans. While this data supports the concept that Lp299v improves vascular endothelial function and
reduces systemic inflammation, only three individuals in the pilot study had T2DM. Whether the favorable effects
of Lp299v supplementation extend to humans with T2DM remains uncertain. Equipose regarding impact of
Lp299v supplementation in human T2DM is further supported by the known significant differences in the
composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota of humans with T2DM suggesting the interaction of T2DM gut
microbiota with Lp299v may significantly differ compared to those without diabetes. The applicant's preliminary
data suggest Lp299v's favorable impact on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular inflammation may
be magnified in individuals with T2DM. We will test the hypothesis that Lp299v supplementation improves
endothelium-dependent vasodilation and microvascular function, reduces inflammation, and improves insulin
sensitivity in humans with T2DM in the setting of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
clinical trial. The proposed studies will both advance our knowledge about a novel method for reducing vascular
risk in T2DM through a gut microbiota-targeted intervention and provide an outstanding framework for mentoring
the next generation of researchers in vascular-centered patient-oriented research."

Familial Dysautonomia represents a rare, particularly devastating form of a peripheral nervous system (PNS)
disorder. Defective development and degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system in FD patients
leads to symptoms including decreased sensitivity to pain and difficulty regulating blood pressure or heart rate.
Some FD patients can have very severe symptoms, while others have much milder symptoms. Interestingly, this
is the case despite the fact that 99.5% of all patients carry a homozygous mutation in the gene ELP1 (previously
IKBKAP). ELP1 protein is involved in transcriptional elongation and tRNA modification, amongst other functions,
and the mutation specifically affects PNS tissues. There are no approved drugs for FD available and patients’
symptoms are merely managed. There is a critical need for a deeper understanding of the mechanistic
underpinning of FD for the development of precise and effective treatments. To understand why there is this
discrepancy of severity in FD, we employed the human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology and successfully
recapitulated phenotypes in vitro that captured varying disease severity seen in patients. For example,
decreased sensation of pain was captured by the development of decreased numbers of sensory neurons
derived from severe FD PSCs. This model further allowed us to identify three potential modifier mutations in
LAMB4, KIAA1211 and FAT2, an extra cellular matrix (ECM) protein, actin regulator and cadherin, respectively.
These were present in severe FD patients only and were absent in mild patients. Thus, we established the basis
for a new paradigm in FD research that FD may consist of two genetically distinct sub-diseases. In preliminary
studies, we were able to employ this model to conduct a chemical screen that allowed us to identify a compound
called genipin that was able to rescue the severe FD phenotype. Here, we propose to expand on our previous
discoveries and define the molecular mechanism behind severe FD. In Aim 1, we aim to understand the
molecular mechanism underlying severe FD. In Aim 2, we investigate the mode of action of genipin and how it
may aid us in understanding the mechanism of severe FD as well as be developed as a potential future treatment
option for FD patients. We believe our studies may enable us to move the field closer toward precision medicine
for FD patients and provide deep molecular insights into the understanding of other PNS disorders."

 With more than five times the number of patients on the wait list than will receive a donor organ in the USA, the
field of transplantation is facing a serious donor shortage crisis. Despite decades of research, a major critical bottleneck is
the current preservation times for whole organs are limited to few hours of storage. Longer preservation times are required
to enable global matching programs, eliminate unnecessary waste of organs, and reduce costs associated with unplanned
surgeries, and are enabling for mixed-chimerism based tolerance induction protocols which require the donor organ to be
kept viable for days so that recipient preconditioning can be done safely. Consequently, the focus of this application is to
address a major unmet need in transplantation by prolonging the length of time organs can be kept in “suspended
animation” ex vivo. Our approach is inspired by the hibernating and freeze-tolerant animals in nature. We aim to embrace
and control the ice formation to achieve high subzero storage temperatures in the presence of extracellular ice, and storage
durations of weeks to ultimately months. It is our hypothesis that the presence of ice in a non-injurious frozen state
enables storage at lower temperatures (down to -30°C) and consequently a deeper metabolic stasis for weeks, while also
enabling scale-up to human organs. In the previous funding period, we developed a new method to use ice nucleating
bacteria to tightly control ice formation temperature and developed a partial freezing protocol down to -15°C that can
store rat livers up to 5 days with ex vivo function, and also established a proof-of-concept in human livers. In this
competing renewal application, we propose to build on our success and reach preservation temperatures down to -30°C,
thus achieving suspended animation for weeks. We propose (i) to control ice formation in liver, which our prior studies
demonstrated to be a key barrier; (ii) to develop targeted approaches to improve preservation of endothelium, which are at
the interface of tissue and ice and are the first point of injury, and (iii) to develop a choreographed metabolic protocol to
maximize ATP recovery and improve viability of the grafts for transplant."

Despite the decline in overall mortality and incidence of cancer in the US population, disparities in cancer care
still largely exist within certain groups. One key barrier causing the lack of proportional representation of these
groups is the lack of dedicated efforts employing scientific rigorous approaches and implementation strategies
for increasing their proportional representation in clinical trials. The Connecting Underrepresented Populations
to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program aims to implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach
and education interventions that will increase the accrual of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. To
support the CUSP2CT program, we are proposing to be the Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC)
to support the data and evaluation activities and coordinate a learning collaborative towards mitigating the key
barriers of cancer disparity. Specifically, we will collaborate with the CUSP2CT U01 investigators and interact
with involved NCI staff members and with other stakeholders, as needed, to carry out the following activities: 1)
establish effective and efficient administrative processes and infrastructure through scientific leadership,
organizational processes, governance structure, effective oversight and operational procedures to achieve
optimal communication, collaboration, coordination, and dissemination of the CUSP2CT research, 2) facilitate
and coordinate data collection and management across the CUSP2CT program to facilitate evidence generation
and rapid dissemination of methods and tools, 3) organize and facilitate collaborative efforts on program
evaluation, engagement, and communication, and 4) foster a learning collaborative in leading and coordinating
trans-CUSP2CT research.
We are uniquely positioned to be the DECC for CUSP2T leveraging strong track record in: (i) implementing
health equity centers and consortia (e.g. Dr. Odedina is MPI on NCI CRCHD U54 CaRE2 Health Equity Center
and contact MPI for a newly awarded Department of Defense iCCaRE for Black Men Consortium); (ii) leading
statistics and data management coordinating center effort in cancer trials (e.g., Mayo is the Statistics and Data
Management Center of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) including both interventional and
NCORP grants); (ii) leading standardization and interoperability for practice and research (e.g., Mayo has been
contributing to the NCI Terminology Service Development Effort and part of the data harmonization efforts in the
NCATS Clinical Data to Health (CD2H)). Additionally, we have strong institutional priorities aligning with
CUSP2CT with existing infrastructure and resources supporting the CUSP2CT mission."

Brazil has the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden in the Western Hemisphere, and among the highest in the
world. Advances in TB diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are necessary to improve the incidence, morbidity,
and mortality of TB in Brazil, and globally. Regional Prospective Observational Research in TB (RePORT)-
Brazil was initiated by our group in 2013, and enrolled 1,188 pulmonary TB patients and 1,930 of their close
contacts in Phase 1. Clinical data and stored biorepository specimens have facilitated studies of predictors of
TB and TB/HIV treatment outcomes, predictors of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and progression to TB
disease and incipient TB, TB-diabetes, drug-resistant TB, TB diagnostics, and Mtb transmission. Strong
collaborations have been established with investigators in Brazil and the United States, as well as other
RePORT networks (e.g., South Africa and India), the Caribbean Central America South America network for
HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and its TB Sentinel Research Network (TB-SRN), which is part of the
International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) network. In Phase 2 of RePORT-Brazil we
will utilize the rich, high-quality clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data generated in Phase 1, together with
new participant enrollment, to extend our understanding of TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and improve
the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TB. This will be accomplished through three Specific Aims: 1) Gain
insights that improve TB diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. This will include external validation utilizing the
TB case registry in Brazil (SINAN; the Brazilian National System of Diseases Notification), and other Brazilian
registries as appropriate; 2) Improve our understanding of Mtb transmission and infection, including latent,
incipient, and sub-clinical disease; predictors of progression to TB, and protection against TB; and 3) Support
and develop the next generation of TB scientists, and enhance the scope and collaboration of RePORT-Brazil.
For Aim 3, we will fund Fellowships in TB Science, focusing on Brazilian investigators. This will include two
Early Career Development Fellowships per year, for pilot projects that support Brazil-US partnerships, and
generate preliminary data for subsequent grant funding; and two Post-Doctoral Fellowships per year. Both
categories of support will be for studies that utilize RePORT-Brazil data and/or specimens; proposals that also
include data and specimens from other TB cohorts will be encouraged. The three Aims will facilitate further
growth and strengthening of RePORT-Brazil, and generate insights that improve the diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of TB in Brazil."

Despite the recognized and urgent need for public health interventions that interrupt outdoor malaria
transmission, no such proven interventions are available. Transfluthrin-treated hessian fabric strips (TTHFS)
offer promise, showing more than six months of mosquito bite deterrence in Tanzanian settings. This project
seeks to clarify and advance the evidence base on TTHFS through meta-analysis of Tanzanian studies, semi-
field and field testing in Thailand and Cambodia, and user acceptability studies in Cambodia to inform future
studies and intervention designs.
Aim 1: To determine the relationship between TTHFS characteristics and their protective efficacy over
time in Tanzania. I hypothesize that an optimal transfluthrin concentration, fabric strip size, and temperature
range for TTHFS can be identified from prior studies in Tanzania, and that impacts on efficacy caused by high
temperature and relative humidity can be quantified.
Aim 2: To investigate the protective efficacy of TTHFS over time in Thai and Cambodian outdoor
conditions. I hypothesize that TTHFS that are efficacious in Tanzania will show similar levels of efficacy in a
very different setting against Thai and Cambodian malaria vectors, with similar effects of temperature and
humidity on the duration of efficacy.
Aim 3: To establish user acceptability and identify modifiable barriers to TTHFS uptake among
Cambodian forest rangers and forest goers. I hypothesize that Cambodian forest rangers and forest goers
will find TTHFS acceptable due to their ability to reduce mosquito bites, but will be uncomfortable with the
product given their limited experience with TTHFS and will have preferences on the size, shape, and design of
TTHFS.
This study will inform a future interventional study of an optimized TTHFS in Southeast Asia, to be performed
subsequent to this K01 study."
10761728,"Project Summary
The widespread use of RNA sequencing technology over the past decade has allowed scientists to discover a far
larger and richer repertoire of genes and transcripts encoded by the human genome than were known just a
decade ago. At least 90% of human genes have multiple isoforms, including splicing variants, alternative sites
of transcription initiation and termination, exon skipping events, and more. The number of human transcripts
in standard gene databases has grown enormously, from ~40,000 in the late 2000s to over 200,000 today, but
it is still likely far from complete. Our previous work using exon-exon splice junctions and other fragmentary
transcripts has demonstrated the clinical relevance of unannotated but expressed genes in the human brain,
including associations with schizophrenia and its genetic risk. This project will attempt to discover and
characterize novel gene isoforms collected from both healthy and diseased brains, using the latest
computational methods for transcriptome assembly and an extensive collection of brain RNA-seq datasets. The
project is organized into three aims: first, we will develop new algorithms designed to assemble RNA-seq data
from samples that have been sequenced using ribosomal RNA depletion, a technique that is widely used in
human brain studies but that is not used in most other RNA-seq experiments, which instead use polyA+
enrichment. We will implement these methods as extensions to the HISAT and StringTie systems for RNA-seq
alignment and assembly, both of which were developed in the PI's and co-PI's labs. We will then apply these
improved methods to thousands of publicly available RNA-seq samples from human brain tissue to create a
new ""CHESS-BRAIN"" (Comprehensive Human Expressed Sequences in Brain) gene annotation database. This
effort will also determine which transcripts are tissue-specific and brain-region specific; i.e., expressed at
significantly higher or lower levels in brain tissues and in various brain regions as compared to other tissues. In
the second aim, we will use these methods to quantify gene expression levels in hundreds of post-mortem brain
RNA-seq samples from subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZD), major depression (MDD), bipolar
disorder (BPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whom we will
compare to matched controls to identify the contribution of unannotated transcription in these disorders. In
our third aim we will perform expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across the entire CHESS-brain
dataset, both within and across brain regions and diagnoses, to identify genetic regulation of unannotated
transcripts, including both coding and noncoding transcripts. This analysis will identify genes and transcripts
whose expression levels change significantly in different tissues and diseases. We will combine these results to
identify novel transcripts associated with genetic risk for each of the psychiatric disorders."
10767832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and
thus is an important clinical problem. Though the current antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was developed in the
1970's and is effective if administered early, its efficacy decreases if given beyond 8 hours after an APAP
overdose. In spite of the significant progress in understanding mechanisms of APAP-induced liver injury in the
subsequent decades, no additional therapeutic approaches to complement NAC have been developed and
translated to the clinic. Part of the problem is the delayed presentation of patients to the hospital, by which time
the injury process is often in progress and any drugs including NAC targeting early processes may be of limited
benefit. It is now recognized that the regenerative capacity of the liver subsequent to APAP-induced injury is a
critical feature dictating patient prognosis. APAP induces a late innate immune reaction in response to cell
injury, and our early studies in mice and humans indicated that immune cell infiltration facilitated removal of
damaged cells and was helpful in regeneration and recovery. Our recently published data now indicate that
guidance cues such as the protein netrin-1 function through the adenosine A2B receptor to suppress
neutrophils and enhance macrophage infiltration into the necrotic area to facilitate liver regeneration and
recovery after an APAP overdose. Based on recent information that neutrophil and macrophage phenotypes
can shift cell functionality from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory, we hypothesize that activation of the
adenosine A2B receptor enhances immune-cell mediated liver recovery after APAP overdose and this could be
an effective late-acting therapeutic approach against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. This hypothesis will be
tested by 1) Elucidating molecular mechanisms involved in macrophage recruitment and liver regeneration
after activation of the adenosine A2B receptor and their facilitation of recovery after APAP overdose in vivo, 2)
Examining the effects of pharmacological modulation as well as deficiency of the adenosine A2B receptor on
APAP-induced liver injury in vivo, and 3) Explore the role of A2BAR agonists and the innate immune response
after prolonged NAC and evaluate circulating monocyte markers from patients after APAP overdose. We have
advanced early acting alternative therapies for APAP overdose such as 4-methylpyrazole (4MP) through pre-
clinical animal experiments and volunteer safety studies to planning of a clinical trial. While 4MP functions to
prevent APAP-induced injury and would be beneficial in patients with severe overdose, it is anticipated that
results from the studies proposed here will provide novel insight into the A2B receptor as a putative target for a
late acting therapeutic to complement 4MP and NAC in the clinic and improve outcomes after an APAP
overdose."

The bacterial pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, has been designated an urgent threat to the US healthcare
system by the Centers for Disease Control. In order for C. difficile to initiate infection, its infectious spore form
must germinate in the gut of susceptible individuals. Since spore germination depends on the spore cell wall
undergoing specific modifications, determining how this process occurs in C. difficile could inform the
development of strategies for preventing C. difficile disease transmission and recurrence."
10747897,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core C: Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics is the application of statistics and computer science to the field of molecular biology. It has
emerged as a field unto itself, as the datasets that are generated by modern biomedical researchers easily
exceeds what can be directly visualized. The vast amount of data increases the chance of false-negative and
false-positive results, and argue for robust statistical models and reproducible workflows. Core C will work with
the data generated from massive parallel sequencing from human, frog and mouse in Project I, II and III and
Core B to extract variants that have potential to cause meningomyelocele or influence neural tube
phenotypes. The PIs of the Projects and Cores have worked together extensively in the past, and have an
established track record of productivity in the area of next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Dr. Bafna
has worked broadly in bioinformatics and genomics in the development computational methodologies employing
novel algorithms and statistical techniques for NGS datasets. We envision that the DNA sequencing derived
from Project I in the form of whole genome or whole exome sequencing from patients and their parents will be
delivered to Core C for determination of potentially pathogenic risk-associated variant prioritization. RNA
sequencing, single cell sequencing and epigenetic sequencing data generated from Core B, as well as imported
from Project I, II and III, will be delivered to Core C for extraction of expression changes, which will be delivered
to each of the Projects for segregation analysis and further validation. The Bioinformatics Core will provide these
analysis pipelines to identify and annotate variants, and to develop innovative network analyses, RNAseq,
Methylseq and single cell analysis to discover novel genetic mechanisms of MM based on Protein-Protein
Interaction (PPI) and gene co-expression networks, to interpret large datasets from current genetic and
genomic technologies, and to apply these in the different components of this Program Project. Although our
primary goal is to provide service using existing computational methods, we expect that the Core B will also
develop novel computational methods as required by the Projects and Cores, as we have done to develop
our current WGS analysis pipeline. Methods development will be geared towards fundamental unsolved
problems underlying the above four key functions, such as algorithms for correlating variants to phenotypes,
further improvements in methods for computing epistatic interactions, detection of short tandem repeats and
mobile elements from WGS, advanced methods for integration of genotypes with pathways, use of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) in analysis of gene association, and discovery of genetic variants that influence
protein expression or function."
10747901,"Abstract – Project I: Human genetics of meningomyelocele and risk mitigation by folic acid
This project focuses on the characterization of genomic variation in human patients with Meningomyelocele
(MM), the most common CNS birth defect, with heritability estimated at 70-75% 1,2, and a cumulative incidence
of 3.72/10,000 live US births. MM is a debilitating structural birth defect, the most common form of NTD
compatible with life, and with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. National folic acid (FA)
supplementation has reduced incidence >3-fold, but there is little understanding of the mechanism of this
Gene-Environment interaction (GXE). Here we propose to study the molecular basis of human MM through a
world-wide recruitment of trios with narrowly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, stratified by prenatal FA
exposure. We hypothesize that de novo mutations (DNMs) make a critical contribution to the risk of MM, and
that FA increases the mutational burden required for phenotypic expressivity. MM shares features with other
severe childhood diseases that show strong DNM contributions such as congenital structural disorders and
autism. Our preliminary data point to a strong DNM contribution to MM, but like autism, these DNM increase
risk but likely act with other factors to determine risk. We propose to ascertain a total of 2000 carefully
phenotyped MM trios, recruited worldwide, stratified based upon national dietary FA supplementation status
at the time of conception (+FA:fortified vs -FA:nonfortified). Trios will undergo whole genome sequencing
(WGS), then analyzed for de novo and inherited mutations as risk factors, compared with control trios. Results
from Project I will be incorporated into workflow of Project II and III to model mutations, and results from
Project II and III will be used to refine WGS analysis in Project I. Project I will rely on Core B to identify
candidate FA-responsive genes from changes in epigenetic signatures, and on Core C for bioinformatic
analysis. Project I has already: 1] Founded the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium and enrolled a cohort of
>1500 MM trios using social media, and historic cohorts, stratified as +FA or -FA. 2] Extracted and QC’d DNA
from >700 of these trios. 3] Competed successfully for NICHDs Gabriella Miller-Kids First program access for
1000 WGS samples. 4] Performed sequencing on 600 trios, as well as optimized algorithms to achieve uniform
mutation calling. 5] Identified 12 MM candidate genes, including 3 recurrently mutated genes, and one
recurrent copy number variant (CNV). 6] Found that +FA trios but not -FA trios demonstrate a striking
accumulation of damaging DNMs compared with controls. We will test the model that de novo and inherited
mutations interact with FA to determine risk. The application proposes to complete recruitment, identify de
novo and inherited gene mutations in MM, correlate with maternal FA exposure, and uncover mechanisms of
disease within a clinical context."
10747909,"Abstract – Project II: Modeling meningomyelocele in frog using human alleles and FA exposure
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a relatively common birth defect with a complex etiology and gene-environment
interactions (GXEs). Genetic factors play an important role, and these gene variants likely interact with one
another in gene-gene interactions (GXGs). A major focus of our Program Project is the assessment of de novo
mutations that can be assessed in patients with NTDs, and their modulation by environmental risk factors, such
as folic acid (FA) accessibility. This complex etiology has made NTDs an extremely challenging syndrome to
predict based on genetic testing and to treat clinically. This proposal is a part of a comprehensive Program
Project to investigate the genetic basis of the NTD subtype known as meningomyelocele (MM), localized to the
spinal neural tube, and occuring in approximately one in every 2,500 births. Project I in the application uses next
generation sequencing to identify de novo gene variants that are associated with human MM patients, and
assess for recurrence. Even for recurrent mutations, it is critical to functionally evaluate causality in an in vivo
setting. This project exploits Xenopus as a high throughput and high content tetrapod experimental model to
assess these variants, taking advantage of the fact that the morphogenetic process of neural tube formation and
the underlying molecular pathways involved in neurulation are conserved between Xenopus and mammalian
embryos. CrispR mutagenesis in F0 Xenopus embryos will be used to test whether genes that lie within deletions
of LCR22C-D in the 22q11.2 interval and that substantially increase risk of MM in humans, cause NTDs as null
mutations. Gene variants detected in the planar cell polarity pathway that may increase the risk of MM in
humans will be tested using rescue experiments in Xenopus, taking advantage of quantitative assays for
measuring planar axis formation. Finally, the assessment of MM gene variants will also exploit recent studies in
Xenopus, indicating that folate deficiency also causes NTDs as in mammals. Interactions between genetic risk
factors and folate deficiency on the incidence of NTDs will be rapidly assessed using Xenopus, as part of the
overall goal to determine whether FA alters gene expression and thus the expressivity of critical gene mutants.
In sum, project II will use Xenopus as model to prioritize MM gene variants identified in Project I that can be
further pursued in experiments in the mouse embryo in project III.
Aim 1. Test genes in the minimal 22q11.2 deletion interval for a role in NTDs using Xenopus.
Aim 2. Test human MM alleles for impact on neural tube formation in Xenopus embryos.
Aim 3. Test GXE by assessing the impact of FA on MM gene phenotypes in Xenopus."
10747918,"Abstract – Project III Modeling meningomyelocele alleles and response to folic acid diet in mouse
The overall hypothesis of the Program Project grant is that de novo mutations contribute to meningomyelocele
(MM) risk and that folic acid (FA) influences the genome through chromatin accessibility and modulation of gene
expression, to alter this risk. The mouse is considered the gold standard model for human neural tube defects
(NTDs), because development is highly conserved in mammals, leading to similar types of cranial and caudal
NTDs, utilizing similar genes, and responding to similar environmental factors. The mouse has been invaluable
in defining genes required for neural tube closure, now numbering over 250 genes, and highlighting the need for
exquisite precision of cell proliferation, actin regulation, planar cell polarity/WNT signaling, cilia/Hedgehog
signaling, and FA metabolism. Many mouse NTD models show allele-specific effects, where for example,
homozygous null mice are embryonic lethal, heterozygous null mice are healthy, but specific point mutations,
some heterozygous, some homozygous, show NTD. In many of these mouse models, NTDs often occur in less
than 100% of offspring, even in an entirely pure genetic background, reflecting background-independent partial
penetrance. Like in human, the penetrance and expressivity of NTD phenotypes can be influenced by FA
exposure, with about half of genes tested to date showing FA responsiveness. FA has been supplemented in
grains in the US diet since 1998, regulating biosynthesis of nucleotides and S-adenosylmethionine, the universal
methyl donor for DNA methylation. To account for these observations, we hypothesize that NTD risk is
established by mutations in a core set of genes, with risk modified by FA-dependent changes in the
epigenome. Project III has already assembled the following preliminary data: 1] Performed recessive ENU-
mutagenesis screens for genes essential for neural tube closure. 2] Assembled a growing collection of genes
and alleles from more than 30 NTD mutants. 3] Demonstrated mutations in primary ciliary genes underlying
several mouse NTD mutants. 4] Demonstrated an impact of FA on penetrance and expressivity of murine NTDs.
5] Developed live-cell imaging platform to observe mammalian neural tube closure in real-time. 6] Modeled
meningomyelocele in mouse for the human MM gene WLS. This proposal focuses on evaluating genes and
alleles emerging from Project I and II as risk factors for MM, as well as the FA-dependent changes in the
methylome and transcriptome that can influence this risk. Altogether, the goal of Project III is to define the
relationships and interplay between mammalian MM mutations and FA influences on penetrance and
expressivity.
Aim 1. Model human meningomyelocele (MM) variants and genetic interactions to assess expressivity.
Aim 2. Assess impact of folic acid on NTD expressivity on a gene-by-gene basis.
Aim 3. Assess impact of folic acid on the neural tube at the level of single cell transcriptome, methylome
and chromatin accessibility landscape."
10762331,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The relationship between sleep and pain is often described as a vicious cycle, such that poor sleep health and
pain cause and exacerbate one another. There is evidence that sleep and pain share the same underlying
mechanisms involving serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine pathways. While most research to date has
focused on the individual effects of sleep or pain on health, the current study proposes to shift this paradigm to
study the joint effects of poor sleep and pain among an at-risk group, healthcare workers (HCWs). HCWs are
uniquely suited as the focus of this research question because apart from clinical populations (e.g., those with
chronic pain or insomnia), HCWs are at greater risk of poorer sleep and pain compared to the general population.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated HCWs' feelings of burden and burnout, as well as brought more
attention to these timely issues of the health and well-being among HCWs. Earlier work has found that HCWs
experience shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, work-related pain, and the spontaneous onset of pain.
There is evidence that sleep and pain have a bidirectional relationship. In Aim 1, the proposed study will examine
the joint effects of poor sleep health and pain, and how this negative synergy affects physical, mental, and
cognitive health and well-being. Given the ample research studying the moderating effects of work
characteristics, Aim 2 will investigate whether job demands and resources moderate the relationship between
the joint effects of sleep and pain on health outcomes. These aims will be examined cross-sectionally and over
time using survey and micro-longitudinal data (collected daily over 8 days), respectively. In total, data from three
separate datasets will be used (n=2,154 HCWs; 5,892 non-HCWs). The central hypothesis is that the joint effects
of sleep and pain will be more prevalent among HCWs compared to non-HCWs, and that the joint effects will
account for more variance than the single individual effects of sleep and pain. Greater pain reactivity to poor
sleep will be associated with more chronic conditions, more negative affect and less positive affect, more
depressive symptoms, and lower cognitive functioning. The second hypothesis is that greater job demands and
fewer job resources will exacerbate the joint effects of poor sleep and pain. Findings may help inform future
workplace interventions and policies to mitigate the harmful effects of poor sleep and pain among HCWs. The
proposed training site and team are well equipped to provide the necessary resources to address these aims.
Upon completing this project, the PI will acquire the theoretical and statistical knowledge to study the joint effects
of sleep and pain among other at-risk groups like older adults. The study team will disseminate their findings by
publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts, presenting at conferences, and contributing to the development of pilot
interventions to mitigate the joint effects of sleep and pain for all."
10911777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease, affecting more than 27 million people in the United States
alone. This large affected population and the severe consequent debility of OA lead to significant expenses to
the health care system. OA is characterized by biochemical, structural and morphologic degradation of
components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage. The ECM is composed of primarily two groups
of macromolecules including proteoglycan (PG) and collagen fibers. Early diagnosis of cartilage degeneration
would require the ability to non-invasively detect changes in PG concentration and collagen integrity before
morphological changes occur. T1, T2 and T1ρ relaxation times are affected by these pathological processes and
are the most widely used biochemical cartilage MRI sequences worldwide.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate the magnetic resonance fingerprinting
(MRF) framework, which allows for simultaneous, morphological, volumetric, and quantitative multiparametric
mapping [T1, T2, T1ρ, B1+ and proton density (PD)] to the knee joint in a much shorter time (≤10 minutes) than
conventional individual parametric mapping on a standard 3T clinical scanner. The proposed MRF-based
multiparametric mapping approach can be easily incorporated into routine research/clinical protocols for multi-
tissue assessment of the knee joint without exogenous contrast agents and could serve as future imaging
biomarkers for disease modifying therapies for OA."

Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Arrhythmia and cardiac fibrosis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy are the primary mechanisms of cardiac
mortality. Pannexins (Pxs), which are large conductance ion and small molecule channels, have been
implicated in other fibroproliferative diseases and are thought to be arrhythmogenic in other model of cardiac
disease. Loss of dystrophin, the primary defect in DMD, leads to elevated intracellular calcium (Ca2+) which is
also a primary effector of Pxs. The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanisms by which Px1
modulates the development of cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmogenesis in models of DMD cardiomyopathy.
Our preliminary data demonstrate a novel role for Px1 in the development of cardiac fibrosis and inducible
arrhythmia seen in the D2-mdx model of DMD. Genetic ablation of Px1 in the D2-mdx model (mdxPx1-/-)
rescues the cardiac phenotype, including normalization of cardiac fibrosis.as assessed by histopathology and
significant reduction in isoproterenol-induced ventricular ectopy. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
pathologically elevated intracellular Ca2+, a hallmark of this disease, leads to Px1 activation and results in
signaling cascades that activate apoptotic, oxidative, and inflammatory pathways that ultimately lead to
fibroblast activation and the development of cardiac fibrosis. We also hypothesize that Px1 channels represent
an independent mechanism for ventricular arrhythmia via generation of delayed after-depolarizations (DADs).
We with test these hypotheses using the 3 specific aims outlined in this proposal. In Aim 1, we will use
transgenic mice with global Px1 deletion in addition to pharmacological Px inhibition to determine if Px1
activation results in triggered arrhythmia. In Aim 2, we will identify the mechanism by which Px1 contributes to
cardiac fibrosis in DMD cardiomyopathy using pharmacological and genetic strategies. As Pxs are expressed
in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, Aim 3 will test if fibroblast migration is dependent on Px1
activation in cardiomyocytes and/or fibroblasts using co-culture techniques for human induced pluripotent stem
cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts. The completion of these studies will help to improve
our understanding of the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease in DMD and will provide the basis for further
investigation of a novel therapeutic target that has the potential to delay or prevent cardiac mortality in DMD
patients. Additionally, this proposal will allow a promising young physician scientist to gain important skill in
basic and translational studies in cardiac electrophysiology, cell signaling, and inflammation/fibrosis biology
under the expert guidance of a highly accomplished and dedicated mentorship committee. These new skills will
provide the foundation for a successful transition from junior investigator to an independently-funded academic
physician scientist."

 Long-term kidney allograft survival has not improved significantly over the last two decades. Accumulating
data supports the hypothesis that progressive glomerular disease drives late kidney allograft failure, with hyper-
filtration mediated glomerular injury being a putative driver. In addition, hyperfiltration is implicated in the progres-
sion of kidney diseases such as in diabetes and obesity, both of which have reached epidemic proportions. How-
ever, the molecular underpinnings of this shared mechanism of kidney disease progression remain unclear and
forms the scientific basis of this proposal.
My long-term goal is to understand disease mechanisms driving late allograft loss, with a focus on prolonging
allograft lifespan. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
hyperfiltration initiates and drives the podocyte detachment process in kidney allografts. We will also test whether
parallel mechanisms are operating in an independent cohort of hyperfiltering diabetic patients.
Towards achieving this objective my central hypothesis is that hyperfiltration leads to a characteristic molec-
ular footprint in the glomerulus that drives podocyte stress and accelerated detachment. To identify the underlying
molecular mechanism of hyperfiltration, a combination of bulk- and single cell RNA-sequencing technology will
be used to identify glomerular cell-specific gene signatures as well as interactions between cells associated with
the glomerular basement membrane that are known to drive podocyte detachment. To enable non-invasive mon-
itoring of podocyte loss, we will use urine pellet podocyte detachment assays and measure hyperfiltration using
filtration fraction studies. We will test the central hypothesis using three specific aims:
Aim 1. Define the glomerular transcriptional response to hyperfiltration.
 Aim 2. Define the glomerular transcriptional profile that drives accelerated podocyte detachment and identify
the effect of hyperfiltration on this relationship.
Aim 3: Define the relationship of allograft hyperfiltration with podocyte stress and detachment.
The research is innovative as it uses human kidney allografts as a model system to focus on hyperfiltration
as a common mechanism of kidney disease progression analyzed by state-of-the-art technologies. The proposed
research is significant as the identification of shared pathways of disease progression between kidney diseases
could lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutic agents and non-invasive monitoring strategies. Ulti-
mately, such knowledge will be crucial to slow down kidney disease progression regardless of its etiology."

Effective and long lasting antibody responses, which require delicate collaboration from both T and B cells, is
essential for immune responses to antigens and successful vaccinations against microbial infections;
however, the mechanisms that regulate T cell function in antibody responses are still not fully understood. In
addition, hypogammaglobinemia is the hallmark of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which can
result in repetitive infections and even death of children and is the most common symptomatic primary
immune deficiency in adults with causal factors in most patients still elusive. Via whole genome exon
sequencing, we have identified a mis-sense mutation in the Strawberry Notch homologue 2 (SBNO2) gene.
SBNO1/2 are conserved nuclear proteins belonging to the DExD/H RNA helicase family. Their orthologue,
strawberry notch (SNO), functions downstream of Notch/Hippo pathways and is important for embryogenesis,
oogenesis, and development of the eye, wing and leg in drosophila. However, the functions of SBNO1/2 in
mammals, especially in the immune system, and whether these two proteins perform overlapping functions
are virtually unknown. We have generated a novel mouse model, Sbno2m/m, that harbors a CVID mutation in
the endogenous Sbno2 gene and conditional Sbno1 and Sbno2 deficient mice. With strong preliminary data
from these mice, we hypothesize that Sbno1/2 are critical players in T cells for their development and
function, particularly in T cell-mediated antibody and anti-viral immune responses. We will 1) determine the
roles of Sbno1 and Sbno2 for T cell development and homeostasis, 2) determine the role of Sbno1 and
Sbno2 in T cell mediated immune responses, and 3) investigate the mechanisms underlying Sbno1/2-
mediated immune regulation. The proposed studies are expected to illustrate novel mechanisms that control
T cell development, homeostasis, and function to shape antibody and anti-viral immune responses. By
illustrating the importance of Sbno1/2 in T cells, we will provide insight into mechanisms underlying T cell
biology and CVID that will guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies against immune-related
disorders."

Aging of T lymphocytes has detrimental effects on the health of older individuals; rendering them susceptible to
cancer, infection, and unopposed tissue inflammation. Older T cells are prone to differentiate into inflammatory
effector cells, rapidly invading into peripheral tissues and promoting inflammatory tissue damage. Multiple
biologic processes have been implicated in mediating T cell aging; including defective DNA repair, telomeric
damage, membrane restructuring into invasive protrusions and reprogramming of cellular bioenergetics. T cell
aging is accelerated by 20-30 years in patients with the inflammatory syndrome rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
providing an excellent model system to study molecular, structural and behavioral abnormalities in old T cells.
Work supported during the previous funding period has identified the DNA nuclease MRE11A as a key player in
T cell aging. T cells from RA patients and from older healthy donors share the transcriptional repression of
MRE11A. T cells low in MRE11A protein accumulate damaged telomeres and induce robust tissue inflammation
with a signature of uncontrolled innate and adaptive immunity. Preliminary data show that MRE11Alow T cells
also lack expression of the nuclease in mitochondria, leading to oxidative damage and cytoplasmic leakage of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In the cytoplasm, oxidized mtDNA promotes NLRP3 inflammasome assembly,
triggers caspase 1 activation and ultimately induces T cell lytic death. Here, we examine the hypothesis that
mitochondrial stress is a driver of T cell aging and that the age-related decline of the DNA repair nuclease
MRE11A exposes T cells to mitochondrial DNA leakage, inflammasome activation and ultimately to
pyroptotic death. We have assembled key enabling resources to mechanistically study how mitochondrial
MRE11A protects T cells from aging; including a large cohort of RA patients in whom T cells are pre-aged and
a chimeric mouse model in which tissue inflammation is induced in engrafted human synovium to corroborate in
vitro data by in vivo studies. Aim 1 examines mechanistically how MRE11A affects mitochondrial function,
generation of ATP and ROS, glucose utilization and lipogenesis. The aim will connect mitochondrial DNA repair
to oxygen consumption in the electron transfer chain and acetyl-CoA oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
Aim 2 investigates how MRE11A guides a mitochondrial stress defense program by preventing mtDNA release
into the cytoplasm. In loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments we will probe how MRE11A regulates
inflammasome assembly, caspase 1 activation and T cell pyroptosis. Aim 3 will identify mechanisms through
which MRE11A deficiency induces tissue inflammation. We will test how caspase 1-dependent cleavage of the
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 and of the membrane pore former gasdermin D drive tissue damage.
These experiments will explore in vitro and in vivo how failed mitochondrial DNA repair causes T cell lysis,
release of alarmins into the extracellular space and initiation of noninfectious inflammation."

This project aims to clinically translate hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate MRI as an innovative metabolic imaging
approach for noninvasive prediction of renal tumor aggressiveness, an unmet clinical need. Our study is in direct
response to PAR 19-264 that supports “The optimization, application and validation of emerging imaging or
biomarker approaches targeted specifically for clinical application”, with the goals to “reduce overdiagnosis”, and
“identify lethal cancers from non-lethal disease”. Our project is motivated by the rising incidence of renal tumors,
largely due to the increased utilization of imaging with incidental discovery of many localized tumors. These
include both benign renal tumors and malignant renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Current imaging or biopsies
cannot reliably differentiate between benign tumors, low grade RCCs, and high grade RCCs. The diagnostic
ambiguity has led to an overdiagnosis of many indolent tumors which are unnecessarily treated by surgery with
surgical risks, and importantly, increased risk of chronic kidney disease and associated cardiovascular disease.
Notably, the increased detection of RCCs has not translated into a decrease in cancer specific death. Therefore,
there is a significant unmet need for novel imaging markers that can improve the risk stratification of
localized renal tumors to guide patient management. HP 13C MRI is an emerging imaging technology that
allows real-time pathway-specific investigation of metabolic processes that were previously inaccessible by
imaging. Our pre-clinical data in orthotopic RCC tumor models have shown that HP 13C pyruvate MRI can
quantitatively map the increased pyruvate-to-lactate metabolism via the lactate dehydrogenase pathway, an
imageable biomarker which is strongly linked to the presence of RCC and its aggressiveness. We have also
demonstrated the feasibility of acquiring dynamic HP 13C pyruvate MRI of renal tumors in patients, with excellent
metabolic contrast between tumor and normal kidney. Building upon these promising preliminary data, we now
propose to investigate for the first time the value of HP 13C pyruvate MRI for risk stratifying localized renal tumors.
Aim 1- we will optimize the MRI acquisition strategies for renal tumor metabolic evaluation. Aim 2- we will
investigate the value of HP 13C pyruvate MRI for differentiating between benign tumors, low grade RCCs, and
high grade RCCs. We will also compare HP 13C data to advanced 1H MRI and radiomics analyses, and develop
multi-parametric model to assess whether it can improve the prediction. Aim 3- we will determine the repeatability
of HP 13C pyruvate MRI of renal tumors, and evaluate new analysis methods to further improve the robustness
of metabolism quantification. Successful completion of this project will provide the first data on the value of HP
13C pyruvate MRI in predicting renal tumor aggressiveness, and will pave the way for future larger clinical studies.
HP 13C pyruvate has already been shown to be safe, and we envision the 13C metabolic imaging markers to be
incorporated into a state-of-the-art multi-parametric MRI to reduce the current overdiagnosis of indolent tumors
while enabling the early detection of aggressive RCCs, and help safely select patients for active surveillance."
10755662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The aim of this proposal is to deliver an innovative and easy-to-use experimental platform for measuring
and quantifying naturalistic behaviors of mammalian animal models used for biomedical research,
including rodents and monkeys, across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This will require developing
a method for tracking movements freely behaving animals with far higher spatiotemporal resolution and
more kinematic detail than currently possible. To overcome the limitations of current technologies, a new
solution is proposed that synergistically combines two methods - marker based motion capture and a video-
based machine learning approach. First, using marker-based motion capture, the gold standard for 3D
tracking in humans, the position of experimental subjects' head, trunk, and limbs will be tracked in 3D with
submillimeter precision. An innovative marker design, placement strategy, and post-processing pipeline
will ensure an unprecedentedly detailed description of rodent behavior over a large range of timescales. To
make the system more efficient, robust, affordable and better suited for high-throughput longitudinal
studies, the unprecedentedly rich and large 3D datasets generated by the motion capture experiments will
be leveraged to train a deep neural network to predict pose and appendage positions from a set of 1-6 normal
video cameras. To best capitalize on the large training datasets, the latest advances in convolutional neural
networks for image analysis will be incorporated. Together, these advances will promote generalization of
the high-resolution 3D tracking system to a variety of animals and environments, thus establishing a cheap,
flexible, and easy-to use kinematic tracking method that can easily be scaled up and adopted by other labs.
The large ground-truth datasets will allow the system to be benchmarked and compared against state-of-the
art technologies in quantitative and rigorous ways. Preliminary studies have been very positive and suggest
large improvements over current methods both when it comes to the range of behaviors that can be tracked
and the precision with which they can be measured. Importantly, all new technology will be readily shared
with the scientific community, thereby leveraging from this single grant the potential for numerous
investigators to dramatically improve the efficiency of their research programs requiring rigorous
quantitative descriptions of animal behavior."
10756098,"Project Summary / Abstract
Research project: The human brain is characterized by dense neuronal connectivity, protracted maturation, and
unique circuit architecture. These features are thought to be critical for our higher cognitive functions, but may
also uniquely contribute to the pathology of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans.
However, how these human-specific traits of neuronal connectivity affect the function of neuronal circuits remains
unknown. Interestingly, the candidate’s rich preliminary work shows that the human-specific gene SRGAP2C
induces human-specific traits in neuronal circuit organization in mice. By studying SRGAP2C and building on
these findings, the candidate will leverage this unique opportunity to investigate the yet unknown impact of
human-specific gene expression on neuronal circuit function. The candidate will train to use wide-field optical
mapping, 2-photon microscopy, and optogenetics, to investigate in vivo how SRGAP2C affects circuit function
cortex-wide and at a cellular level. Finally, using a sensory-discrimination task, the candidate will test whether
SRGAP2C-mediated changes in circuit architecture affect behavior and learning.
Candidate and career goals: The candidate has a strong background in molecular and cellular neurobiology,
having spent his PhD studying the mechanisms underlying neuronal circuit formation. Dr. Schmidt has a deep
interest in understanding the mechanisms that shape neuronal circuit architecture. His long-term career goal is
to establish an independent laboratory focused on uncovering the relationship between neuronal circuit structure,
function, and behavior. He is particularly interested in determining the mechanisms underlying unique aspects
of human brain development and evolution. His unpublished work has already revealed remarkable effects of
the human-specific genetic modifier SRGAP2C on neuronal circuit organization. The goal of this proposal is to
uncover the role SRGAP2C plays in regulating cortical circuit function and behavioral performance.
Career development plan: The candidate will work with two internationally renowned mentors, Drs. Franck
Polleux and Rui Costa. Dr. Polleux is an expert in using genetic, molecular, cellular, and imaging techniques to
study cortical connectivity. Dr. Costa is an expert in combining in vivo microscopy and optogenetics with
behavioral approaches. In addition, the candidate has assembled a unique team of collaborators, consisting of
Drs. Elizabeth Hillman, Randy Bruno, and Darcy Peterka, who will be instrumental in training him in the use of
in vivo microscopy and setting up the sensory-discrimination task. The candidate’s excellent mentors and
collaborators will advise and guide him in both his research and his transition towards an independent career.
As part of the neuroscience community of Columbia University, Dr. Schmidt will work within an exceptional
research environment. He will benefit from excellent facilities and all needed equipment for the proposed
research. Moreover, he will work in a highly supportive training setting that offers extensive opportunities to
present and receive feedback on his research, and resources for transitioning to an independent research career."

Astrocytes are a glial subtype that are essential for numerous central nervous system functions. Dysregulation
of astrocyte function is known to cause a variety of neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Interestingly,
disruption of hypothalamic astrocytes has the capability to compromise fertility. Roughly one in five couples in
the USA suffer from some type of infertility, thus elucidating the complete circuits underlying reproduction is
essential. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the preoptic area and hypothalamus form the
final common pathway for the central control of fertility. Pulsatile GnRH secretion causes release of luteinizing
hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary, activating gonadal functions
including steroidogenesis. An afferent network likely governs pulsatile GnRH secretion, including both steroid-
sensitive kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (KNDy neurons) and glia. Although pulsatile GnRH release
is common to male and female reproduction, females exhibit unique processes including reproductive cycles
and ovulation that could alter neural-glial interactions. Critically, astrocytes exhibit morphological plasticity and
the levels of hypothalamic neuron ensheathment by glia change across cycle stages, pointing to potential
astrocytic regulation that varies with respect to cycle stage. Astrocytic mediators like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
can also regulate GnRH neuron activity, and PGE2 is required for timely sexual maturation and adult
reproduction in rodents. To investigate the contexts in which astrocytes regulate reproductive neural circuits, a
combination of electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and glial cell cultures will be used. Aim 1 will study if factors
including sex, cycle stage, and time of day influence the ability of astrocytes to regulate GnRH and/or KNDy
neuron firing rates. In vitro chemogenetic activation of astrocytes via the transduced Gq signaling receptor
hM3D(Gq) will be employed to induce intracellular calcium transients that typify endogenous Gq-induced
astrocyte activity, while monitoring the activity of identified neurons. In Aim 2, chemogenetic activation of
primary astrocyte cultures followed by high-performance liquid chromatography of supernatants will be done to
elucidate the gliotransmitter profiles of hypothalamic astrocytes. To compliment this, the endogenous Gq-
coupled receptor profiles will be assessed in glial cultures and brain slices transduced with GFAP-GCaMP6f
via treatment with candidate Gq ligands. These results will inform my subsequent experiments in which an
endogenous Gq-coupled receptor will be knocked down in hypothalamic astrocytes and a gliotransmitter
receptor in GnRH neurons, providing a test for the necessity of these components of glial-neural signaling for
reproduction in vivo. Completion of the proposed work will clarify roles of astrocytes in the neuroendocrine
control of fertility. Elucidating the mechanisms by which astrocytes communicate back-and-forth with GnRH
and KNDy neurons will pave the way to identifying potential therapeutic targets to treat types of infertility."
10820135,"Veterans seen in VA primary care and mental health clinics commonly present with complaints of sleep
disturbance, especially insomnia. For example, in a cross-sectional study examining sleep disorders among
Veterans seeking care through the Veterans Health Administration between 2000-2010, sleep apnea (47%) and
insomnia (26%) were the most commonly diagnosed conditions. In a study of 375 Operation Enduring
Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Veterans, 45% reported extended time spent trying to fall asleep (> 30
minutes), 21% reported reduced total sleep times (< 4.5 hours), and 56% reported being awake in bed more
than 15% of the night. Similarly, in another observational study of 5,552 Veterans, 57.2% of the sample
population was found to have insomnia disorder. This sample also was at high-risk for a host of clinical disorders,
including PTSD, TBI, and pain; all of which showed higher rates of insomnia.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a multi-component intervention that features sleep
restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, and can include relaxation techniques.
CBT-I is recognized as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia and is effective in Veterans, however,
limitations to use still remain. In recent years advances in treatment approaches have attempted to streamline
CBT-I by focusing on delivery of specific treatment components, reducing number of treatment sessions, and/or
use of technologies that provide for ease of dissemination and implementation. Brief Cognitive-Behavioral
Therapy for Insomnia (bCBT-I) represents one such empirically tested brief intervention which may decrease
patient burden through reduced sessions needed to achieve treatment goals and through use of hybrid treatment
administration (i.e., in-person and telemedicine).
To better inform both clinical practice and future research, this investigation proposes to assess the comparative
effectiveness of bCBT-I to VA standard CBT-, with several overarching goals: 1) in a randomized clinical trial
(RCT), evaluate the equivalence (non-inferiority) of bCBT-I to VA standard CBT-I; 2) evaluate the impact of these
treatment approaches on functional rehabilitation outcomes; 3) evaluate the impact of these treatment
approaches on psychiatric symptomatology; and 4) in an exploratory fashion, determine which patient factors
best predict success or failure with a given treatment as a means of developing insomnia phenotypes that might
be used diagnostically to match patient characteristics and type of treatment to help optimize clinical outcomes
(i.e., a “personalized medicine” approach to treatment).
The investigation timeline consists of four parts: 1) baseline assessment of sleep, functional, and psychiatric
outcome measures; 2) randomization and assignment to either CBT-I or bCBT-I; 3) post-treatment assessment;
and 4) 3-month follow-up assessment. Over 40 months of recruitment this study will enroll and randomize 180
Veterans on a 1:1 ratio (CBT-I:bCBT-I= 90:90) from VA primary care and mental health clinics at two Centers of
Excellence sites (VA San Diego Healthcare System and Finger Lakes VAMC Healthcare System). For the
primary study aim, one-sided mean difference testing will be conducted with the noninferiority margin added to
the null value. Secondary analyses will utilize structural equation modeling to evaluate how CBT-I and bCBT-I
influence functional and psychosocial outcomes. The Exploratory aim will utilize moderation analyses to better
understand for whom either CBT-I and/or bCBT-I might be more effective."
10750946,"The directed movement of eukaryotic cells away from a source of a chemorepellent appears to play a
major role in development and the resolution of inflammation, but very little is known about eukaryotic
chemorepellents and how they direct cell motility. Chemorepulsion of Dictyostelium cells from a secreted
protein called AprA is a model where one can combine biochemistry and genetics to elucidate chemorepulsion.
Using available mutants and a preliminary genetic screen, we identified the AprA receptor, identified several
components of the AprA signal transduction pathway, and found that AprA chemorepulsion involves a
fundamentally different mechanism from chemoattraction.
 AprA has predicted structural similarity to the human secreted protein dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV),
and shares functional properties with DPPIV. We found that DPPIV is a chemorepellent for human and mouse
neutrophils, found that the G protein-coupled receptor PAR2 mediates DPPIV chemorepulsion, and found that
small molecule PAR2 agonists act as neutrophil chemorepellents. Preliminary studies indicate that there are
strong similarities between the AprA and PAR2 agonist chemorepulsion mechanisms.
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an untreatable disease involving damage to the lungs
causing neutrophils to enter the lungs. The neutrophils further damage the lungs, causing more neutrophil
entry in a positive feedback loop, and this results in the death of ~40% of the ~200,000 ARDS patients per year
in the US. An exciting insight into a possible therapeutic approach is that when DPPIV or PAR2 agonists are
aspirated into the lungs, they induce neutrophils to leave the lungs in two mouse models of ARDS. The key
roadblock to moving this into the clinic is that we need to know what the PAR2 agonist chemorepulsion
mechanism is to anticipate potential drug interactions and side effects.
 To gain insights into a fundamental mechanism, and ways to induce neutrophils to leave a tissue, we
propose to elucidate the AprA and PAR2 agonist chemorepulsion mechanisms using the power of
Dictyostelium to lead the work. We will rigorously test newly identified Dictyostelium chemorepulsion pathway
components, and determine where they function in the pathway. We will complete the Dictyostelium genetic
screens to gain further insight into chemorepulsion, and then use this information to guide an examination of
possibly similar mechanisms in neutrophils. While examining human neutrophil chemorepulsion, we observed
a significant difference between male and female neutrophils, and we will delineate the extent and molecular
mechanism underlying this difference. Together, the proposed work will elucidate a poorly understood
fundamental mechanism, elucidate an unexpected sex difference in the innate immune system, and help
elucidate how PAR2 agonists could be used clinically to drive excessive neutrophils out of a tissue, with
possibly different treatments for men and women."

 The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate basic principles of chemosensory
perception. It seeks to explain at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels how chemosensory
information is encoded. The experimental plan takes advantage of the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster as a model system, which allows incisive molecular genetic analysis of
chemosensory receptors, neurons, and circuits, and of the functions they perform.
 The project considers a kind of chemical information that underlies one of the most
ancient and fundamental of biological problems: how an animal detects a mate of its own
species. A cluster of four ionotropic receptor genes, IR52a, IR52b, IR52c, and IR52d, the
chemosensory neurons in which they are expressed, and the circuitry they activate will be
analyzed to test hypotheses about their role in mate detection.
 The first aim will provide a rigorous analysis of the expression and function of these
genes in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as analyzing their counterparts from a related
species. The experimental plan is designed to test hypotheses about the molecular logic of
mate detection.
 The second aim takes advantage of a recent advance in electrophysiology that allows
new analysis of the cellular responses to pheromones. The proposed experiments are
designed to provide pheromone-to-neuron and pheromone-to-receptor maps of a
chemosensory organ. The aim may also provide a new ""empty pheromone neuron"" system
useful in analyzing pheromone receptors of a variety of species and in identifying compounds
that activate or inhibit them.
 The third aim exploits a new means of labeling neural circuits. It measures the
responses of second-order neurons to pheromones. It also tests the hypothesis that
pheromonal input from taste neurons is combined with olfactory input at an early stage of
processing, before ultimately being translated into behavioral output.
 Diseases carried by insects afflict hundreds of millions of people each year. These
insects detect their mates and their human hosts largely through their chemosensory systems.
Advances in understanding these chemosensory systems may lead to new means of
manipulating them and of thereby controlling these insect vectors of human disease."

Electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) are promoted as an alternative to smoking during pregnancy,
however the immediate and long-term effects are still unknown. Current estimates are that 5-16%
of pregnant women will use e-cigs with the expectation that are either ‘reduced’ or ‘no’ risk to
offspring health. Yet, inhalation exposures during pregnancy are of significant concern, because: 1)
the developing fetus is at a vulnerable period, and 2) even ‘low-levels’ of smoking during
pregnancy are known to have measurable vascular health risk to offspring. Thus, there is a
critical need for preclinical studies to examine vascular related outcomes, particularly in the context
of exposure during pregnancy. We have previously established the maternal vaping during
pregnancy significantly impairs cerebral vascular function in offspring (even through adulthood).
The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the direct effect of vape exposure on offspring born with prior
history of in utero exposure due to maternal vaping, and secondly to determine whether full-term vs
limited trimester exposure produces differences in cerebral vascular structure and function in
offspring in adolescent and adult life. Based on our preliminary data, our overall hypothesis is that e-
cig usage during pregnancy (irrespective of nicotine) creates a hostile gestational environment that
leads to reduced cerebral vascularity and blunted vascular responses in offspring later in life. Aim 1
will combine direct e-cig exposure in adolescent- and adult-aged offspring that already have blunted
cerebral vascular reactivity secondary to in utero exposure from maternal vaping. Aim 2 will use
different exposure patterns of maternal vaping during pregnancy (full-term vs individual trimester
exposures) to determine if there is critical exposure window that (more greatly) influences
cerebral vascular structure and function in offspring. The proposed studies will identify
consequences of maternal vaping combined with secondary direct exposure to offspring later in
life; and identify what time frame during pregnancy that vaping might have the greatest influence on
cerebral vascular health on offspring. We anticipate our data will provide toxicological and clinical
evidence to inform clinicians and consumers on consequences of vaping during pregnancy, as well
as information for regulatory agencies when establishing public policy, guidelines or regulations."

Humans and other primates rely on using visual shape information to identify and interact with objects in the
world. The goal of this project is to gain mechanistic insights into how the primate cerebral cortex processes
visual shape information. Cortical area V4 is an ideal locus for these mechanistic studies because many V4
neurons are tuned for visual shape, showing preferences for convex or concave segments along an object's
bounding contour. This tuning for visual shape is presumed to be a foundation for behaviorally relevant object
representations, but we know little about its mechanistic implementation. Chiefly, we do not know which cortical
pathways and cell types are responsible for generating this tuning in V4 neurons. In this project, we will begin
to fill these knowledge gaps by employing viral vector-mediated, cell type-specific optogenetics in monkeys. In
Aim 1, we will ask: How does visual shape processing in V4 depend on feedforward excitatory signals from
earlier cortical areas V1 and V2? The experiments related to this aim will test the hypothesis that feedforward
excitation from area V2 is the dominant factor in dictating the shape tuning of V4 neurons. In Aim 2, we will
ask: How does visual shape processing in V4 depend on local inhibitory signals within this area? The
experiments related to this aim will test the hypothesis that inhibitory neurons are tuned for shape, and that
local inhibition sharpens the tuning of excitatory neurons. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical first
insights into the role of feedforward excitation and local inhibition in visual shape processing. A deeper
understanding of these cortical circuit mechanisms in primates has the potential to transform the way in which
we treat disorders of form vision such as visual agnosia. Advancing optogenetic techniques for neural circuit
dissection in monkeys will also facilitate the investigation of other complex brain functions that are specific to
primates: an imperative for advancing basic science and human medicine."
10751033,"High IOP is a major causal risk factor for glaucoma and is the target of all current glaucoma
therapies. This project investigates pathways that control intraocular pressure. Abnormalities in
these pathways contribute to glaucoma. By characterizing pathways that control IOP using
mutant mice, we expect to better understand glaucoma risk at a molecular level and will provide
important new models for studying IOP and glaucoma. Characterization of important regulatory
models will improve understanding and ultimately guide new treatments. New and more
effective IOP-lowering treatments are needed. In glaucoma, elevated IOP results from
increased resistance to aqueous humor (AQH) drainage at the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal
(SC). The inner- wall endothelial cells of SC (SECs) are the final barrier to AQH exit into the
ocular vasculature and are critical in controlling AQH outflow. Approved medications do not
directly target the inner wall or the fundamental pathology that increases outflow resistance in
glaucoma. To correct this, greater knowledge of SC biology is required and we will assess the
role of mechanotransduction in determining IOP. Abnormal mechanotransduction may result in
elevated IOP and glaucoma. A central player in endothelial mechanotransduction is the
adherens junction complex (AJC) of which VECADHERIN (VECAD) is a critical protein.
Although SECs express VECAD and AJC proteins, the role of these proteins in determining
AQH outflow is not yet demonstrated. We will test the hypothesis that the VECAD is required for
AJC mechanotransduction in SECs, controlling AQH outflow and IOP. Our preliminary data
support this hypothesis. We will test our hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1) Determine if
AJC protein phosphorylation/ signaling adaptively responds to IOP changes in vivo. Aim 2):
Determine the role of VECAD in regulating IOP in vivo. Studying mice with mutant version of
VECAD will provide key information about its functions and may provide valuable new models of
glaucoma. Aim 3) Determine the role of phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in VECAD
in IOP regulation. We will assess the roles of key tyrosines in vivo by using mutant mice where
individual tyrosine residues have been mutated to phenylalanine."
10806937,"The proposed R25-NIDCR Research Education in Genomics Training Program with Diversity Action Plan (DAP)
is to provide summer research experience in Genomic Sciences, Medicine and Society in dental, oral and
craniofacial areas with a special emphasis on analysis of next generation sequences (NGS) for 20 undergraduate
students from diverse backgrounds, specifically students from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in
biomedical research, with disabilities, and from disadvantaged backgrounds.
NGS has revolutionized biosciences and biomedical research and is on the verge of transforming clinical
practice. It is critical to train a new and diverse generation of biological and quantitative dentist scientists and
oral health researchers for mining this vast amount of public data in order to address current challenges to
public health. Data science has transformed the field of medical genomics and is likely to permeate all aspects
of dentistry from risk management to the bedside through personalized treatment decisions on dental, oral and
craniofacial diseases. We anticipate a critical need for dental researchers with strong skills in big data analysis,
with particular emphasis on genomics. This need is further emphasized in the requirements of quantitative
analysis skills in biosciences graduate programs, DDS/PhD programs (T32, T90/R90), Post-DDS
Residency/PhD program (K12) programs all the way to the practice of dentistry.
To address the need in dental, oral and craniofacial science for researchers and practitioners from diverse
backgrounds with strong data science skills, we will establish the “Bruins-In-Genomics in Dental, Oral and
Craniofacial Research Training Program (BIG DOC)”. This program will leverage the infrastructure of the
existing, highly successful UCLA “Bruins-In-Genomics (BIG)” Summer Undergraduate Research Program (BIG
Summer)” which is hosted by the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences (QCB) at UCLA. BIG
Summer consists of a combination of practical workshop tutorials that focus on NGS data analysis skills, and a
hands-on research experience with UCLA faculty in genomic sciences, medicine and society. The proposed
R25-NIDCR BIG DOC program will fund 20 students to join the existing BIG Summer program and partner with
faculty with a research focus in dental, oral and craniofacial genomics. The students will be quantitative or
biosciences majors entering their junior and senior years. We expect that for many of our participants, this
research experience will serve as a launching point for their research careers and career development in dental,
oral and craniofacial research. Program recruitment will emphasize academic excellence, enthusiasm, diversity
and underrepresented minorities."
10756502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances using CAR T cells in lymphoid malignancies have made it clear that manipulation of the host
immune system can radically alter the course of a cancer. Although there have been lifesaving responses in
some patients, all too many patients have inadequate responses. Some patients and tumor types have been
more amenable to CAR T cell therapies than others, despite similar levels of antigen expression, uniformity,
and density. The exact mechanisms by which CAR T cells induce tumor cell death are unknown, and may be
due to a combination of multiple T cell effector functions that ultimately result in cell death, potentially by
triggering programmed cell death in tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that CAR T cells mediate tumor cell
death by inducing programmed cell death (PCD) pathways in target cells. A logical corollary of this hypothesis
is that one potential mechanism of resistance, which has received scant attention, is genetic or functional
resistance to PCD in the target tumor cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the state of PCD constituents in
tumor cells confers sensitivity or resistance to T-cell mediated killing, and that this relative resistance can be
overcome with drugs that enhance PCD signaling in tumor cells. Finally, because systemically administered
drugs that enhance PCD signaling may also affect CAR T cells, we propose genetic engineering approaches to
render CAR T cells resistant to candidate PCD-enhancing drugs. This is a collaborative project between an
expert in CAR T cells and immunology and an expert in programmed cell pathways and tumor biology.
Together we aim to define the effector functions of T cells that induce tumor cell death (Aim 1), define the
programmed cell death pathways in tumors that confer sensitivity or resistance to CAR T cell mediated killing
(Aim 2), and use innovative strategies to enhance CAR T cell killing of tumor cells by manipulating PCD
pathways using small molecule drugs in combination with genetic engineering of the CAR T cells."
10767302,"Latinos are the fastest growing subpopulation of older adults in the U.S.A. and have a greater prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than non-Latino whites (1). Despite this, our knowledge of normal aging, cognitive
decline, and AD-related neurodegeneration in Latinos is sparse. A growing body of evidence supports a link
between AD onset and several modifiable factors, some of which convey risk (e.g., mid-life hypertension, sleep
and mood distrurbance). Other factors are considered protective, such as engaging in regular physical activity,
managing cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., diabetes, obesityand hypertension), maintaining a healthy diet, and
engaging in lifelong learning (2). It is also known that some of these modifiable risk factors have a higher
prevalence in Latinos, compared to non-Latinos (3). Nonetheless, how these factors independently or
interactively make older Latinos more vulnerable to accumulation of AD pathology, cognitive decline, and
dementia remains unclear. Thus, investigating the impact of different AD risk factors on cognition, brain
function, and AD molecular markers of pathology in older Latinos is pivotal to improving prevention,
early detection, and development of novel treatments and interventions for this critically underserved
and understudied population.
 To promote recruitment and participation of Latinos in biomarker and aging research, we initiated a registry
of older community-dwelling Latinos living in Massachusetts (known as the Boston Latino Aging Registry).
Furthermore, with the support of an administrative supplement in 2019 we began to include more Latino
participants in the ongoing NIA-funded Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is now known as Latino HABS. We
propose to build upon these previous recruitment efforts to study aging and preclinical AD in non-demented
older Latinos and non-Latino White individuals. All participants will undergo a comprehensive assessment of
cognition, amyloid and tau PET scanning, as well as structural and resting fMRI. They will also complete self-
report measures of modifiable dementia risk factors (e.g. cardiovascular disease, sleep, mood), all of which will
be used to create an overall dementia risk score. Comparisons between Latinos and non-Latinos will be made
in all aims with the goal of using the findings to validate and inform biomarker findings in older Latinos.
 Our ultimate goal is to build a cohort of older Latinos that we can be followed up overtime. For the current
R01 grant, we propose to enroll a total of 200 older community dwelling individuals (60-80 years; 150 Latinos
and 50 non-Latinos) and compare them to 200 already enrolled in HABS (60-80 years; 150 non-Latinos and 50
Latinos) to 1) investigate modifiable dementia risk factors and cognition in older Latinos and non-Latinos; 2)
examine modifiable dementia risk factors and memory network dysfunction in older Latinos and non-Latinos;
and 3) examine the associations between modifiable dementia risk factors and markers of brain pathology in
older Latinos and non-Latinos."
10830907,"Post mortem and neuroimaging data suggest an intact locus coeruleus helps to maintain cognitive performance
in older adults. However, the basic mechanisms of this relationship are still unknown. The locus coeruleus is the
source of most of the brain's noradrenaline but it is not yet clear how age-related decline in the locus coeruleus
affects noradrenergic activity, and in turn, how these changes in noradrenergic activity modulate cognitive
behavior. For instance, it is unknown whether age-related deficiencies in neuromodulation and processing result
from decreased or increased locus coeruleus activity. Our long-term objectives are to determine the role of
noradrenergic activity in modulating cognitive impairments and to identify means of preserving stable autonomic
function to prevent or delay the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The specific research goals of this
proposal are to identify the mechanisms by which noradrenergic activity modulates distractibility by salient but
irrelevant distractors in older and young adults. Both specific aims will utilize resting state recordings and an
oculomotor search task that measures attentional inhibition of eye movements to determine whether tonic
noradrenergic discharge directly modulates inhibitory mechanisms of attentional control. In Aim 1, we will
investigate whether elevating tonic noradrenergic activity in older and young adults using threat of unpredictable
shock induces arousal by pupillometric and electrophysiological measures. Furthermore, we will examine
whether these changes will influence attentional control by modulating the magnitude of attentional inhibition of
eye movements and phasic noradrenergic responses. We predict that older adults' distractibility will be less
modulated by threat of shock than that of younger adults given our hypothesis that older adults already sustain
higher levels of tonic noradrenergic release and hyperactivity. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether reducing
tonic noradrenergic activity following slow-paced breathing and meditative practices improves attentional focus
in older adults and young adults with high basal sympathetic activity. The goal of this aim is to determine the
functional benefits of managing noradrenergic activity for attentional control as well as for measures of general
arousal and phasic noradrenergic discharge. We predict that the benefits of the intervention in Aim 2 will be
greater in older adults than that in young adults. The overall findings from this proposal will address a critical gap
in knowledge connecting the mechanisms of neuromodulation on age-related declines to behavior, with
theoretical implications in neuroprotection and preservation during aging. In addition, the training goals and
objectives builds on the applicant's research expertise in psychophysiological research and fMRI with research
expertise in the field of aging, training in EEG methodologies and analyses tools that are used in the field, and
the professional development necessary to transition into an independent academic investigator. The research
and mentorship team comprised of Drs. Mara Mather, Rael Cahn, and Markus Werkle-Bergner are the ideal fit
to train the applicant in accomplishing his research and training goals throughout this fellowship."
10731736,"Melanoma, while composing only 1% of all skin cancers, causes the majority of skin cancer related deaths. In
the United States alone, over 100,000 new patients have been diagnosed with melanoma in 2021. While
plastic surgeons are frequently responsible for the oncologic reconstruction and removal of melanoma, few
surgeons in this field have the basic science training needed to understand the underlying molecular defects of
this condition or the dynamics of the mammalian epidermal microenvironment, in which they specialize. Such
knowledge is crucial for a holistic approach to the field of plastic surgery because the dysregulation of
intercellular communication between cells in this skin microenvironment, such as melanocytes, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, leads to various aesthetic and life altering defects such as those seen in vitiligo, keloid formation
and melanoma. We believe that a better understanding of developmental melanoblast migration can provide a
framework for future patient interventions and provide much needed context for future surgeons. This belief is
supported by recent studies in human melanoma, which show that the transcriptomic genetic profile of
melanoma cells closely mimic developmental melanoblasts. Second, it is well established that one of the
hallmarks of malignant melanoma is the loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, but how adhesive
interactions between melanocytes and their surrounding keratinocytes via E-cadherin regulate melanocyte
behavior and homeostasis is not well understood. I hypothesize that melanocytes form specialized adhesions
with keratinocytes that serve to maintain the epidermal barrier while simultaneously promoting melanocyte
migration, colonization, and retention within the epidermis. I plan to test this hypothesis, by using the Cre-Lox
system under the control of a K14 epithelial promoter to selectively label melanocytes and knockout E-cadherin
in the keratinocyte microenvironment of the epidermis. I will then characterize the impact of disrupted
melanocyte-epithelial adhesions on melanocyte migration, protrusivity and colonization (Aim 1), identify the
composition and localization of melanocyte-epidermal adhesions and actin regulators (Aim 2) and determine
the impact of disrupted melanocyte-epithelial AJs on melanoma progression in a melanoma mouse model (Aim
3). This proposed project will be the first of its kind to characterize the impact of the surrounding keratinocyte
microenvironment on melanoblast migration and function; thus, seeing the epidermis as a complex
microenvironment with varying cell types, a biological reality that is often overlooked in medical training. This
proposed project and the training plan herein is designed to cultivate the necessary training to provide an
increase in translational research to the field of plastic surgery. This collaboration between Princeton University
and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Department of Plastic Surgery provides the clinical, basic
science training, mentorship, and resources necessary to accomplish this goal. It is our hope that this work will
be used to benefit patients with a history of melanoma worldwide."
10690481,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how the brain creates an internal representation of the sensory
world, and how the coordinated activity of neurons and circuits transforms this representation into simple
actions and behaviors. To get at these questions, neuroscientists rely heavily on a small set of model
organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice. These provide the advantage of excellent experimental
access owing to their sophisticated neurogenetic techniques and facile propagation in the laboratory. Yet, an
unintended consequence of this focus is that most of what we know about sensory representation comes from
a very limited number of species—a few vertebrate and invertebrate model animals that are adapted to live in
moderate conditions favorable to humans, like those of a common laboratory. The goal of this proposal is to
establish the desert-dwelling fly Drosophila mojavensis as a new model system to study the cellular and
molecular mechanisms behind sensory adaptations to environmental conditions such as extreme heat and dry
air. The work proposed involves the application of genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated knockouts and transgenesis to study principles of thermo- and hygro-sensory processing in this
species. Comparing the organization of sensory circuits in this desert-dwelling fly to those of the common
laboratory fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster will lead to a greater understanding of the conserved principles
behind temperature/humidity sensing and preference behavior, and help reveal the evolutionary forces that
shape an animal’s ability to colonize new environmental niches. In general, increasing the diversity of the
model systems we study will proportionally increase our understanding of how sensory systems evolve, reveal
conserved principles of sensory processing, and ultimately help us better extrapolate results we obtain in
animal studies to the human nervous system, in both normal and disease states."
10754540,"The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) helps mediate responses to stress, yet is also implicated in developing and/or
maintaining health disorders of chronic pain, drug addiction, anxiety and depression. KOR agonists have shown
promise in ameliorating these disorders, but are limited by dysphoric side effects. Beneficial effects of KOR
agonists (e.g., analgesia) are considered predominantly mediated by G protein signaling, whereas β-arrestin
signaling is considered central to their detrimental side effects (e.g., dysphoria). However, the mechanism(s)
by which these signals downstream of KOR are regulated are still being elucidated. The Regulators of
G protein Signaling are intracellular proteins that accelerate signal termination after G protein-coupled receptor
activation. RGS12 is a complex member of this protein family, with at least five different domains that interact
with components of both G protein-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. We recently reported that
RGS12 is enriched in the ventral striatum (vSTR), and global Rgs12 ablation decreases locomotor responses to
dopamine (DA)-modulating psychostimulants. Our data correlate with the augmented DA transporter (DAT)
expression and function in the vSTR, but not dorsal striatum (dSTR), seen in RGS12-null mice. Loss of RGS12
(especially as a Gai/o-directed GTPase-accelerating protein) may indirectly increase DAT expression / function
by removing negative regulation downstream of KOR, given that KOR agonists are known to increase DAT
surface expression and uptake function. Supporting this notion, the augmented DAT function and reduced
AMPH-stimulated locomotion caused by RGS12 loss are both reversed following KOR antagonism. We also
found elevated KOR expression in the vSTR, but not dSTR, of RGS12-null and β-arrestin2-null mouse strains.
RGS12 over-expression augments β-arrestin recruitment to activated KOR – an effect preserved following
pertussis toxin-mediated Gi/o inhibition or mutation to the Ga-interacting domains of RGS12, suggesting a
G protein-independent mechanism. These findings are consistent with our newest data that RGS12-null mice
exhibit attenuated KOR agonist-induced conditioned place aversion, considered β-arrestin-dependent behavior.
Collectively, our data highlight a role for RGS12 as a novel, differential regulator of both G protein-dependent
and -independent signaling downstream of KOR activation, a regulation that may be exploitable
pharmacologically to help shift KOR-mediated signaling to beneficial outcomes and away from detrimental ones.
Our first aim is to determine the specific neuronal populations within which RGS12 acts to modulate G protein-
dependent and -independent KOR signaling, testing hypotheses that RGS12 operates to modulate KOR and
DAT function specifically in KOR- and DAT- expressing CNS neurons, and also operates at the level of the spinal
cord. Our second aim is to delineate the molecular determinants that engender selective functional interactions
between RGS12 and KOR. Success in pursuit of these two aims will provide key pre-clinical data for considering
RGS12 a valid target for future analgesic and anti-addiction therapeutics that engage KOR signal transduction."

10531203,"Summary: Role of IL-7R in CNS Autoimmunity
 IL-7 is an essential cytokine for the development of T and B cells and plays an important role in
inflammation by stimulating Th1, Th17 cells and GM-CSF production. The IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) complex
consists of IL-7R alpha-chain (IL-7Rα) and common γ-chain (γc) and polymorphisms in the IL-7Rα gene
are associated with an increased risk for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although these observations suggest that
signaling through IL-7R has a pathogenic role in CNS autoimmunity, its underlying mechanisms are
unclear. In this regard, we have made the following preliminary observations: 1) Dendritic cells (DCs)
express IL-7Rα in homeostatic conditions and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), an animal model of MS; 2) conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking the IL-7Rα gene in DCs are
protected from EAE; 3) IL-7Rα cKO EAE mice have a significant increase in IL-9+Foxp3+ regulatory T
(Treg) cells; 4) IL-7Rα cKO DCs produce the vasoactive polypeptide Endothelin-1 (Edn-1); 5) DC-derived
Edn-1 induces IL-9 production by T cells; and 6) Ab-mediated depletion of Treg cells or IL-9 restores EAE
susceptibility in IL-7Rα cKO mice. Together, these and other observations form the bases of our
hypothesis that IL-7Rα in DCs enhances EAE severity by suppressing the development of Edn-1-
induced IL-9+ Treg cells. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific aims: 1) To dissect the
mechanisms by which IL-7Rα downregulates Edn-1 production by DCs and promotes EAE. We will study
the mechanisms by which IL-7Rα suppresses Edn-1 in mouse and human DCs, and the role of DC-
derived Edn-1 on neuroinflammation by genetic ablation and inducible expression. 2) To investigate the
signaling pathways by which Edn-1 induces IL-9+Foxp3+ Treg cells. We will investigate the mechanisms
of IL-9 induction in Foxp3+ Treg cells by ETBR signaling by genetic approaches in vivo and in vitro, and
study the effect of dimethyl fumarate, a common therapy for MS, on the expression profile of IL-7Rα+DCs,
IL-9+Foxp3+ Treg cells and Edn-1 and its receptors in MS patients. 3) To test the therapeutic effect of
Edn-1 and its analogues in EAE. This will be tested in myelin-reactive T cells, and multiple EAE models,
including relapsing-remitting and chronic progressive EAE.
 Overall impact: Experiments in this study focusing on IL-7Rα, a genetic risk factor for MS, will
enhance our understanding of the pathways and cellular interactions that promote CNS autoimmunity as
well as investigate novel approaches to treat MS."
10744215,"ABSTRACT
The long-term goals of my laboratory are to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate sister chromatid
cohesion and chromosome segregation during meiosis and to understand why meiotic chromosome
segregation errors in human oocytes increase as women age. The incidence of meiotic segregation errors
increases dramatically as women age. Such errors are the leading cause of birth defects and miscarriages
in humans but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon (termed the maternal age effect) are
not well understood. One prerequisite for accurate chromosome segregation is sister chromatid cohesion,
the protein-mediated linkages that hold sister chromatids together. In human oocytes, meiotic cohesion
must be maintained for decades, from the time it is established in the fetal ovary until ovulation triggers
resumption of meiosis and anaphase I. Several lines of investigation support the model that age-induced
loss of cohesion contributes to the maternal age effect. We have discovered a “cohesion rejuvenation”
program in Drosophila oocytes that establishes new cohesive linkages during prophase I and our recent
genetic screen has identified several candidate rejuvenation players. Aim 1 will use a number of
approaches to further delineate the mechanism(s) underlying rejuvenation. For over two decades,
accumulation of oxidative damage in aging oocytes has been proposed to contribute to the maternal age
effect. My lab recently provided the first causative link between oxidative stress incurred during meiotic
prophase and premature loss of meiotic cohesion. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a moderate
increase in the enzymes that scavenge superoxide radicals can significantly decrease age-induced
segregation errors in Drosophila oocytes. Our recent proteomics efforts have identified proteins that suffer
oxidative damage when oxidative stress is induced during meiotic prophase. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses
that one or more of these identified candidates are required to maintain meiotic cohesion and that their
ability to do so is compromised by oxidative damage incurred during oocyte aging. Sirtuins regulate several
aspects of cellular homeostasis and reduced sirtuin activity is associated with aging. In addition, mounting
evidence suggests that sirtuins protect cells, at least in part, by modulating autophagy. Our recent findings
support the hypothesis that at least two Drosophila sirtuins are required to maintain cohesion during meiotic
prophase. Aim 3 will investigate the intersection between sirtuin activity and autophagy in the maintenance
of meiotic cohesion and how aging impacts these processes. Through genetic and proteomic screens, we
have uncovered several unexpected connections between cohesion rejuvenation, oxidative stress and
autophagy in the oocyte that uniquely position us to make fundamental discoveries regarding the
mechanisms that maintain meiotic cohesion and how these are impacted by aging. Our work addresses a
major reproductive health issue that impacts the pregnancy outcomes of many women."
10746785,"Project Summary
Sign language is vital to the lives and well-being of many deaf people in the United States who rely on this
mode of communication. However, current theories in linguistics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience have
all been developed primarily from investigations of spoken language. The focus on speech leaves open many
critical questions about linguistic phenomena that are fundamentally shaped by the visual-manual modality.
NIDCD recognizes these gaps in our understanding – the Strategic Plan states, ”Enhancing our understanding
of visual-manual language systems opens a window into general human cognition (pg. 32).” This project aims
to develop a neurobiological model of sign language perception and comprehension that takes into account
essential modality-specific phenomena: phonology without sound, lexical iconicity (non-arbitrary mappings
between the form and meaning of signs), and `spatial syntax' (the use of locations in signing space to express
grammatical roles and co-reference). Aim 1 of the project is to map the cortical representation of phonological
structure in American Sign Language (ASL) using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI
adaptation methods will be used to investigate whether body-selective neural regions become tuned to
linguistic handshapes and body locations in signers. In a second fMRI study, Phonological Neighborhood
Density in ASL will be manipulated to identify neural areas that support lexical-level phonological
representations. Aim 2 of the project is to identify the impact of iconicity on lexical representations and
learning. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) will be used to assess whether effects of iconicity are task
dependent (e.g., related to the use of picture stimuli) or reflect distinct neural representations for iconic signs
(e.g., more robust encoding of sensory-motor semantic features). ERPs will also be used to investigate
whether brain responses to iconic signs change with learning and whether learners represent signs as
wholistic gestures or are sensitive to internal phonological structure. Aim 3 of the project is to identify the
neural network involved in comprehending `spatial syntax'. fMRI will be used to determine whether right
parietal cortex is engaged when understanding ASL verbs that are directed toward locations in signing space
(R-loci) to indicate grammatical roles. A second fMRI experiment is designed to identify the neural correlates of
spatial indexing (the establishment and maintenance of R-loci). Overall, the project aims to enhance our
understanding of the neurobiology of visual-manual language, which will provide a translational foundation for
treating injury to the language system and for diagnosing language impairments in deaf individuals."
10740853,"Project Summary
Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds.
Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable
vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are
especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the
key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in
vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to
understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical
responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive
aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying
this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and
optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and
circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These
advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body
movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this
pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We
also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female
courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli.
Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable
vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic
vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to
combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo
multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel
computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization
suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare
spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the
vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if
vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically
quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit
mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing."
10746421,"We have been studying subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC WAT) beiging in response to mirabegron,
which is a β3 adrenergic receptor (β3AR) agonist. β3ARs are found in adipocytes and smooth muscle, and
mirabegron is an FDA approved drug for overactive bladder. Treatment of obese, insulin resistant humans for
twelve weeks with mirabegron consistently induced SC WAT beiging and this led to improved oral glucose
tolerance and a lower HbA1c. The mechanism for improved glucose homeostasis involved both a small
improvement in insulin sensitivity and a significant improvement in β-cell function (insulin secretion) along with
an increase in muscle oxidative type 1 fibers; however, there was no weight loss or induction of brown fat.
Since pancreatic β-cells and muscle do not express the β3AR, the beneficial effects of mirabegron in these
cells likely occurred by an indirect mechanism.
 The physiological effects of mirabegron are likely mediated in part by the induction of beige adipose, which
represents a metabolic sink for glucose and lipids and which may alter adipose remodeling. In addition, the
changes in adipose tissue and other organs may result in secondary effects that target other tissues.
 Specific Aim 1. To examine the effects of the β3 agonist mirabegron on glucose metabolism, we will
comprehensively analyze glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell function in prediabetic subjects in a
4-month, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. We will assess changes in adipose tissue including beiging,
inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes. We will also fully characterize
gene expression in SC WAT by RNA-seq to identify potential mechanisms such as altered adipokine profiles.
 Specific Aim 2. We hypothesize that mirabegron causes cells that express the β3AR to change the levels
of secreted factors that affect peripheral cell types such as β-cells and muscle. We will use biochemical and
pharmacological approaches to identify the mechanism by which conditioned medium from mirabegron-treated
adipocytes increases PGC1α expression in muscle in vitro. We will utilize unbiased approaches to identify
changes in lipids, metabolites, and exosome miRNA composition in the adipocyte conditioned media. We will
use these approaches to identify molecules altered in plasma by mirabegron treatment that are responsible for
the improvement in β-cell and muscle function.
 Clinical relevance: Mirabegron treatment has positive effects on glucose tolerance due to improvements
in insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. This may be exploited to prevent conversion of prediabetes to
diabetes or used as a therapeutic in diabetics. This application will also increase our understanding of the
mechanism(s) by which mirabegron acts, which may reveal new therapeutic targets"
10636627,"Abstract
White adipose tissue (WAT) is a metabolically active organ that is adaptive and undergoes changes throughout
the human lifespan. While adipocyte number can increase via recruitment of precursors in the stromal vascular
fraction (SVF) of WAT to differentiate into adipocytes, the total number of adipocytes in WAT is set mainly
during adolescence, and thus changes in WAT mass, adiposity, mostly reflect alterations in lipid storage. In
obesity, WAT may become severely dysfunctional and does not expand properly to store the excess energy,
resulting in ectopic fat deposition and lipotoxicity in other tissues. Unhealthy expansion of WAT by adipocyte
hypertrophy (increasing cell size) may also result in deleterious effects, such as insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes. In addition, SVF populations may drastically change and be contributing factors towards disease
progression. Hence, maintaining white adipose tissue with balance between adipocyte hypertrophy and
hyperplasia (increasing cell number) is important for whole-body metabolism and energy balance. In general,
WAT is categorized as either subcutaneous (SAT) or visceral (VAT) adipose tissue. SAT provides insulation
and cushioning and serves as a long-term energy storage depot. VAT cushions and maintains distance
between organs and is critical for lipid storage during hyperphagia. While VAT is associated with pathological
conditions, such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, SAT is protective against these diseases.
During aging, VAT tends to increase while SAT decreases significantly. VAT expansion occurs as lipid storage
is shifted from SAT to VAT and visceral adipocyte hypertrophy increases. However, the explanation behind the
decrease in metabolically protective SAT mass during aging has been more elusive. Although the
developmental origin and function of VAT and SAT are known to differ, in general, the proliferation and
differentiation capacities of adipose precursor cells (APCs) in each depot are believed to drastically decline
during aging. I have recently reported that aging-dependent regulatory cells (ARCs) emerge and accumulate
as a unique subpopulation of SAT during aging. ARCs arise from APCs but exhibit impaired differentiation
capacity and express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines.
By secreting cytokines, such as Ccl6, ARCs
inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of neighboring bona fide APCs. Thus, the emergence of ARCs is
responsible for the drastic decrease in adipose precursors and defects in adipogenesis, resulting in the loss of
SAT during aging. Interestingly, the transcription factor PU.1 is the driver for the development of ARCs in SAT
during aging. Though I have shown PU.1 to be responsible for the development of ARCs, the exact
mechanism by which PU.1 alters the transcriptome of ARCs is currently unknown. Therefore, the objective of
the proposed study will be to 1) identify the mechanism by which PU.1 alters gene expression in ARCs and to
2) characterize the role of PU.1 on SAT function in vivo."
10733435,"Project Background/Rationale. Pain is one of the most disabling and common nonmotor symptoms in
Parkinson’s disease (PD), with a prevalence of 40-85% (Broen et al., 2012). Research indicates that
undertreatment of pain is particularly high in the PD population. Only about one-half of patients with PD who
report pain receive regular pain medications (Broen et al., 2012; Negre-Pages et al., 2008; Beiske et al., 2009).
There is increasing interest in nonpharmacological treatments for chronic pain in PD to supplement
pharmacological approaches. While there is evidence to support the utility of physical exercise to improve
chronic pain management, relatively less is known about the role of cognitive exercise.
Project Objective. We propose to conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with chronic pain in PD
to assess the impact of physical and cognitive exercise interventions on pain outcomes.
Project Methods. A total of 166 community-dwelling veterans, 40 years of age or older, with chronic pain in
mild-to-moderate PD will be randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to one of four groups (1 – combined
cognitive and physical intervention, 2 – physical intervention only, 3 – cognitive intervention only, 4 – health
education). We will test the effects of the interventions at 3 months for the outcomes pain severity and pain
interference, both assessed with the use of the Brief Pain Inventory."
10773025,"ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the USA, with an estimated 158,000 deaths in 2016. The
direct cause of the majority of these deaths is the eventual emergence of resistance to initially effective therapies.
This evolution of drug resistance represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology. While most research
is focused on the individual molecular alterations that confer this resistance, we instead propose to focus on the
eco-evolutionary processes that generate these alterations. To study the Darwinian evolution and ecological
interactions occurring within heterogeneous tumors, we will tightly integrate bespoke mathematical models and
experimental techniques designed to inform them. Focusing on EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer, a
cancer type with a highly efficacious targeted therapy with which we have experience in our lab, we will approach
this problem with three, orthogonal, integrated mathematical-experimental Aims. First, to understand the
ecological interactions occurring at the inter-cellular level in heterogeneous tumors, we will couple our experience
with evolutionary game theory with our first-in-class evolutionary game assay, which we have designed to
specifically for this purpose. Here, we hope to learn to target the interactions that drive resistance – a novel
strategy which could open up entirely new avenues of drug design. Second, we will allow evolution to show us
the convergent phenotypes it creates in the face of specific selective pressures through long-term directed
evolution. During this long-term evolution, we will measure phenotype, in the form of drug sensitivity to a panel
of chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies at regular intervals, creating the first temporal collateral sensitivity
map in any solid tumor. By pooling common phenotypes observed throughout the evolutionary life history, we
will then use interactomic and seed-based protocols to generate molecular signatures of these states of
sensitivity, which we will validate in publicly available data and in an in library of PDX lines. Finally, we will delve
deeply into the relevant time scales of the ecological and evolutionary processes we study in the first two aims.
We plan to apply the replicator-mutator framework of evolutionary game theory to a spatial transform that we
pioneered in cancer. To validate and parameterize these models, we will also test the evolutionary stability of
the ecological dynamics we measure with our game assay by performing the assay through evolutionary time
during a long-term evolution experimental. Each of our three orthogonal aims is supported by recent high impact
publications, and each represent tightly coupled experimental and computational protocols. Our clean, well-
designed integration, together with innovative focus on the direct study of the evolutionary biology, promises to
shed light on this difficult area of cancer research, and offers the possibility of providing generalizable insights."
10747364,"SUMMARY
 B cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) is the 7th most common cancer in the US and the predominant
type of hematologic malignancies – accounting for ~50% of all diagnosed cases. Despite a better
understanding of their genetic repertoire, the factors governing the unique transcriptional and signaling
dependencies of different B-NHL subclasses remain incompletely understood. As such, clinical responses to
standard-of-care therapies are highly heterogeneous. There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel
tailored therapeutic strategies that provide more effective and durable responses.
 Here, we show that a member of the PRDM family of lineage determining transcription factors
(PRDM15) is abnormally upregulated in B cell malignancies and propose to assess its potential as a novel
drug target. Our preliminary data strongly support that PRDM15 can be depleted without major adverse effects
in vivo. A targeted depletion in pre-malignant B-cell cells, will however strongly delay lymphomagenesis.
Mechanistically, PRDM15 acts by transcriptionally regulating tumor-promoting metabolic pathways (e.g.,
PI3K/AKT, glycolysis). Interestingly, while dispensable for B cell differentiation under steady state conditions,
PRDM15 plays a role during B-cell activation, that notably results in metabolic changes equivalent to those
occurring in lymphomas.
 We hypothesize that PRDM15 modulates transcription, and consequently the expression, of proteins
(e.g. IGF1R, INSR, HK3) involved in the essential metabolic changes imposed by physiological B cell immune
activation or oncogenic transformation. This project aims to better define PRDM15 as a key regulator of
metabolic rewiring during these processes. We propose to investigate this central hypothesis in the following
Specific Aims: In Aim1 we will assess the mechanistic role of PRDM15 in tumor initiation and maintenance and
to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting PRDM15 in specific tumor subsets. Specifically, we will focus
on downstream genes and pathways ultimately regulated by PRDM15 in B cells lymphomas. In Aim 2 we will
characterize PRDM15’s role in normal hematopoiesis and B cell responses, both at steady state and upon
external challenges (e.g. exposure to foreign antigens, bone marrow reconstitution). This will be relevant both
to understand the role of PRDM15 in the context of normal B cell differentiation and to evaluate the potential
risks or side effects of therapies targeting PRDM15 functions.
 The significance of these studies is that given the importance of PRDM15 for metabolic rewiring of
activated and transformed B cells, understanding the mechanism of action of PRDM15, will allow targeting its
degradation or inhibiting its function and may be of future therapeutic relevance.
 The health relatedness is that our studies may identify new therapeutic opportunities for a variety of B-
cell lymphomas that have high energetic demands."
10703248,"Background: Telemental health (TMH) via videoconferencing or phone can increase Veterans’ access to
mental health (MH) care. TMH can eliminate barriers including travel distance and cost, as well as physical
limitations, caregiving responsibilities, and MH symptoms that can make leaving home difficult. Prior to COVID-
19, rates of TMH in VA were low (~9%). There was a dramatic shift towards TMH during COVID-19 to prevent
infection, with ~50% of care delivered by phone, ~25% by video, and ~25% in-person. Benefits and drawbacks
of phone, video, and in-person care must be considered when choosing a MH care modality. If patients,
providers, and/or leadership believe that phone care is equivalent in quality to video and/or in-person, they may
be more likely to choose this modality as it often has the fewest barriers to use; however, based on limited
evidence, phone care may be lower quality than video and in-person. We need more nuanced analyses
regarding: 1) the relative quality of phone, video, and in-person care (e.g., for more complex patients, for
psychotherapy sessions versus shorter medication management appointments), and 2) patient preferences. As
a clinical psychologist and HSR&D investigator with TMH experience, I am well-positioned to conduct this
research. This proposal will provide key methodological training and advance me toward my goal of becoming
a leading health services researcher and implementation scientist with expertise in telehealth.
Significance/Impact: MH, telehealth, access, and quality of care are all major HSR&D research priorities. The
increased use of TMH during COVID-19 has led to a wealth of untapped data through which we can examine
the relative quality of TMH care as well as patient preferences across modalities, in order to improve care
modality decision-making processes. Results, which will incorporate data from millions of patients and
thousands of providers, have the potential to impact delivery of high-quality MH care on a national scale.
Innovation: To our knowledge, there has been no published research that: 1) compares the quality and patient
preference of phone, video, and in-person MH care, and 2) uses this information to develop and implement
evidenced-based strategies to increase video use when clinically effective and preferred by patients.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine quality outcomes of phone, video, and in-person MH care (e.g., differences in
MH hospitalization rates). Hypothesis: Video care will be equivalent to in-person care and superior to phone
care for more complex patients (e.g., history of MH hospitalization, 3+ MH diagnoses) and for psychotherapy
appointments. Aim 2: Qualitative interviews with MH patients, providers, and leadership. Research question:
What are facilitators/barriers to video use based on stakeholder attitudes, preferences, and decision-making
processes, and how do these factors vary between sites with high levels of phone, video, and in-person care?
Aim 3: Develop/pilot implementation strategies to increase video use in circumstances where it is clinically
effective and preferred by patients. Hypothesis: Implementation strategies will increase video use.
Methodology: In Aim 1, I will test for differences in quality outcomes between modalities via a sample of ~2
million Veterans who received MH care between 3/2020-3/2021 using comparative effectiveness research
strategies. In Aim 2, I will conduct interviews with key stakeholders to understand facilitators and barriers to
video use based on attitudes, preferences and current decision-making processes. In Aim 3, I will synthesize
Aim 1 and 2 findings to develop and pilot implementation strategies at one VISN 1 MH site to increase video
use in circumstances where it is clinically effective and preferred by patients. Strategies will be targeted at the
patient, provider, and/or system levels based on Aim 1 and 2 findings.
Next Steps/Implementation: The piloted strategies will be spread to additional MH sites, and ultimately other
clinical services, via hybrid implementation-effectiveness trials in subsequent IIRs. Findings will be
communicated to MH and Connected Care operational partners to inform the future of VA MH care delivery."
10755322,"Project Summary: The goal of this proposed mentored research is to tie genetic variation to disease by
analyzing regions that are intolerant to variation. Identifying regions that are intolerant to new variation can help
localize regions of potential functional importance and biologic relevance. Large public population consortia are
now accumulating datasets of sufficient size to detect regions subject to evolutionary selective pressures at an
increasingly granular level. However, there remains a shortage of appropriate analytical tools that are built to
specifically address important issues of disease heterogeneity across diverse populations. Despite the fact that
clinical exome sequencing is increasingly used for improved diagnostic evaluation, many genetic disorders
remain uncharacterized and diagnosis rates are still relatively low. In Aim 1, I will develop methodology that
localizes regions intolerant to variation and differential isoform expression associated with disease. Many genes
display tissue dependent transcript isoforms indicating potential functional implications of different isoforms. I will
characterize selective pressure across all isoforms using Bayesian techniques by looking at patterns of genetic
constraint across large standing populations, predominantly leveraging public data sets on the order of hundreds
of thousands of samples. Then I will leverage existing expression data to isolate key isoforms across different
cell and tissue types that are associated with diseases of interest. Then by accounting for regional intolerance
to variation, a joint transcriptomic variation–intolerance approach can be employed to improve disease
association testing. In Aim 2, I will analyze ancestry and cross species patterns of genetic intolerance to
variation. The majority of genetic studies have focused on European populations, which ignores genetic and
phenotypic diversity that can be leveraged to improve both targeted and overall diagnostic and clinical
capabilities. I will test for ancestry and cross species patterns of genetic intolerance to variation and association
with disease. Expanding to more populations will scale up the already large set of parameters being estimated;
so, I will develop new statistical methods and software to improve optimization of parameter estimation for the
Bayesian hierarchical models. I will isolate key ancestral populations with known differences in selective pressure
to validate findings while then leveraging these new methods and population disease patterns further to isolate
novel signals of ancestry-specific selective pressures. I will look for conserved regions across species to isolate
essential exonic regions while also isolating unique regions in the context of human specific genetic variation
and disease, such as neurodevelopmental disorders. During the training time for this proposed study I will focus
on advancing my understanding of biologic mechanisms and clinical genetics to better inform the statistical
genetics methods I develop. My mentorship and advisory committee consists of a strong multidisciplinary team
of geneticists, pathologists, computational scientists, and biologists who will guide and collaborate with me to
refine my work to improve variant interpretation and to advance precision medicine."

Dr. Michael Kohanski is an assistant professor in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology – Head and Neck
Surgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania. His clinical practice is focused
on the medical and surgical management of inflammatory sinus and nasal disorders to improve the upper
respiratory health of his patients. Dr. Kohanski's recent research efforts led to the finding that rare taste
receptor expressing cells, solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs), are significantly enriched in inflammatory sinus
polyps. This work established a connection between chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) seen in humans to the
important finding that tuft cells (analogous chemosensory cells in the intestine) are crucial for regulating Type 2
immunity. With the support of this award, Dr. Kohanski will develop expertise in mucosal immunology,
epithelial physiology and bioinformatics to study solitary chemosensory cell regulation of airway inflammation
and repair. Dr. Kohanski will augment his fund of knowledge through course work on immunology, epithelial
physiology and bioinformatics. He will acquire new research skills with focused mentoring and training from a
multidisciplinary group of experienced researchers at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in epithelial
taste receptor biology, Type 2 inflammation and epithelial cell physiology and repair as well as bioinformatics.
This proposal focuses on identifying and characterizing taste-specific or inflammatory-specific inputs that
stimulate SCC differentiation as well as understanding the mechanisms by which solitary chemosensory cells
can amplify inflammatory and innate mucosal responses. This is a novel area of research with little work to
date characterizing the role or function of chemosensory cells directly in human upper respiratory inflammatory
diseases such as CRS with nasal polyps. In Aim 1a, Dr. Kohanski will characterize SCC abundance and SCC-
specific gene expression directly in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and determine if SCC abundance
correlates with phenotypic markers of airway inflammation in a cohort of patients with CRS. In Aim 1b, he will
determine if taste or inflammatory input stimulate differentiation of human SCCs and if there are distinct human
SCC subtypes. In Aim 1c, the PI will leverage initial RNAseq results to further study the mechanisms of SCC
differentiation and epithelial repair. In Aim 2, Dr. Kohanski will test the hypothesis that SCC-mediated epithelial
signaling occurs through two-pore potassium channels. In Aim 2a, he will utilize Ussing chambers to
determine if inflammation or SCC abundance affects K2P channel function. In Aim 2b, he will use a house
dust mite model of inflammation with mouse strains deficient in two-pore potassium channels or SCC taste
transduction to determine if inflammation amplifies the ability of SCCs to regulate epithelial defensin release.
Progression through these experiments coupled with expert mentorship and coursework will provide Dr.
Kohanski with the foundation to become an independent investigator with a focus on epithelial chemosensory
cell function and the resultant impact on the mucosal immune response and inflammatory airway disease."
10755698,"Robust immune tolerance conferred by Foxp3 transcriptional regulation
 Regulatory T (Treg) cells actively suppress self-destructive T cells that cause a variety of autoimmune
diseases. Despite significant progress, Treg-based treatment is significantly constrained by limited methods to
improve Treg suppressive capacity. We aim to dissect the mechanistic processes of Treg induction and lineage
maintenance to uncover the factors and mechanisms conferring robust immune suppressive function. Treg cells
are induced by the convergence of environmental cues delivered to differentiating T cells with considerable
variations, resulting in stochastic Treg development. Besides, the DNA sequences of the genetic elements
regulating Treg lineage identity also vary among individuals. Given the enormously diverse T cell antigen
receptors (TCRs) and target specificities, Treg cells are induced with many uncertainties. Once committed, Treg
fate is maintained for extended suppressive function by cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors that constantly
fluctuate. All these uncertainties raise a question about how robust immune tolerance is conferred by Treg cells.
 Study of Treg master regulator Foxp3 offers a unique approach to address this question, because Foxp3
expression centers Treg fate determination and function. We hypothesize that an adequate buffering capacity
conferred by efficient Treg development and lineage stability opposes the genetic variations and immune
perturbations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the Foxp3 enhancers that dictate Treg induction and lineage
stability. Individual Foxp3 enhancers were known to play stage-specific roles in Foxp3 induction or maintenance.
However, mice bearing their individual mutations develop mild if any immune dysregulation despite significant
defects in Treg development or lineage stability. To solve this mystery, we examined the epigenetic mechanisms
mediating Foxp3 expression and hypothesize that Foxp3 enhancers coordinate to enable efficient Treg induction
or stable lineage identity for adequate Treg buffering capacity.
 We generated new mouse strains to test our hypotheses and found that deletion of two interacting Foxp3
enhancers caused fatal autoimmune diseases accompanied with severe defects of Treg induction or lineage
stability. This result together with other studies delineates a full spectrum of Treg buffering capacity acquired
through coordinating Foxp3 enhancers. In the proposed study, we will fully uncover the immunological
consequences of mice with severely reduced Treg induction or lineage stability. We will develop new algorithms
and use single cell RNA sequencing to assess Treg repertoire diversity and lineage stability to infer Treg buffering
capacity. We will also use our newly developed mouse genetic tools to determine the role of continuous thymic
Treg induction in maintaining the Treg buffering capacity.
 Overall, our study will uncover a full spectrum of Treg suppressive capacity conferred by Foxp3
transcriptional regulation. It will improve our basic understanding of Treg-related autoimmune diseases."
10766721,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most daily tasks demand cognitive control, but people vary in their motivation to meet the control demands
required of those tasks. Motivational impairments are a common and transdiagnostic feature of a wide range of
psychiatric and neurological disorders—including major depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s—severely
compromising the daily functioning and overall wellbeing of individuals with these disorders. Unfortunately, little
is known about the neurocomputational mechanisms that drive these impairments. We recently developed a
computational model of how people make decisions about control allocation based on an evaluation of the costs
and benefits (the Expected Value of Control [EVC] model). Our model points to several potential sources of
motivational impairments and their putative neural substrates. These include deficits in learning about incentives,
signaling those incentives when expected, and/or properly utilizing those incentives when making decisions
about control allocation. The model suggests that dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) is responsible for integrating
incentive information in order to motivate the level of cognitive control that is most worthwhile. Our model further
points to two dissociable components of the incentives for control: (1) the expected efficacy of control (the extent
to which control is necessary to reach a particular goal) and (2) the expected reward for reaching that goal.
Previous research has primarily focused on the latter component. It is therefore largely unknown how efficacy is
learned and anticipated; how it is integrated with reward to guide control allocation; and to what extent
motivational impairments are caused by deficits in the processing of efficacy. We have developed and validated
a set of tasks that tease apart the independent influences of reward and efficacy on effort allocation. We will
have adult participants perform these tasks while undergoing EEG or fMRI, to characterize the
neurocomputational mechanisms by which expected reward and efficacy are (1) signaled, (2) utilized to
determine effort allocation, (3) updated based on feedback, and (4) generalized to novel stimuli. We predict that
dACC will integrate reward and efficacy information from separate frontoparietal inputs, to determine the amount
and type of control that is most worthwhile. This control allocation will be enacted through dACC’s interactions
with goal-specific prefrontal and subcortical regions. We also predict that reward- and efficacy-selective regions
of frontostriatal and frontoparietal circuits will interact to guide learning and generalization of task incentives. We
will test these predictions with model-based analyses of behavior and neural activity, using our EVC model to
generate participant-specific estimates of incentive processing and control allocation across trials. This research
will offer critical new insight into the computations and circuits underlying the motivation of cognitive control. It
therefore has the potential to inform our understanding of the mechanisms of evaluation and motivation more
generally, and to provide a path towards improving diagnosis and treatment for impairments that are both
prevalent and transdiagnostic."
10744184,"Project Summary
Alterations in protein-protein interactions (PPI) can result in dysregulated biological signaling. PPIs are critical
drivers of a plethora of disease states and are increasingly recognized as important therapeutic targets.
However, PPIs have been difficult to target with traditional therapeutics, and are often considered
“undruggable”, because traditional small molecule discovery strategies are not well suited to identify molecules
with suitable properties to disrupt PPIs. When a disease-associated PPI target is identified, translating that
information into a validated molecular probe can take years, development of a clinically useful therapeutic can
take decades, and even worse, in most cases these efforts fail entirely. The costs associated with developing
therapeutic leads limits pursuits towards only thoroughly validated targets. A faster, less expensive, and more
efficacious pipeline for PPI inhibitor discovery would allow researchers to quickly identify probes for directly
perturbing PPIs in relevant model systems to assess the validity of the PPI as a therapeutic target and to
generate candidate inhibitors for clinical development. While almost all areas of basic and translational biology
research have benefitted from 21st century technological advances in genetic sequencing, mass spectrometry,
and other diagnostics, drug discovery still largely relies on 20th century methods, which have proven to be
frustratingly slow and unsuccessful in critical ways—our proposed technology aims to solve these problems.
We hypothesize that continuous evolution techniques will allow us to rapidly evolve PPI inhibitors for a wide
range of cytosolic protein targets. Specifically, we will pursue two key advancements to realize this broad goal.
In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that non-continuous selection followed by phage-assisted continuous evolution
(PACE) allows us to rapidly evolve protein binders for diverse proteins using a library-of-libraries approach.
This approach will eliminate a crucial bottleneck in PACE, optimization of initial selection stringency, and bring
PACE much closer to automated plug-and-play allowing for broader adoption of this technique. In Aim 2, we
will construct and validate a PACE compatible biosensor linking disruption of a specific PPI to phage fitness
allowing for us to directly select for PPI inhibitor function. Our goal is to demonstrate generation and validation
of high potency PPI inhibitors for a given target in under 1 month. We will validate these evolution platforms
using three well-studied oncogenic protein-protein interactions that have been the focus of small molecule drug
development for decades: MDM2-p53, KRAS-RAF, and Myc-MAX. While this is a lofty goal, the power of
evolution has long been recognized as a promising solution to this problem; we are hopeful that by merging
innovative biosensor designs and continuous evolution, we can unlock the full potential of laboratory evolution.
If successful, these platforms have the potential to revolutionize the drug discovery paradigm and accelerate
the discovery of novel PPI inhibitors."
10939620,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Background: The proposed study seeks to address chronic pain disparities in racially diverse,
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals by optimizing multimodal pain management provided in primary
care safety net clinics. Multilevel barriers exist in primary care settings where socioeconomically disadvantaged
patients are most often treated. Lack of access to multimodal and nonpharmacologic care at the organizational
level, and provider bias and other forms of discrimination at the interpersonal level contribute to unequal
assessment, treatment, and quality of pain care. Stigmatization cross-cuts all levels and is closely linked with
social isolation common among individuals with chronic pain. Group-based models are a promising multilevel
approach to increase access to non-pharmacologic therapies, address time constraints that contribute to
disparities in pain care, improve interpersonal communication, and provide social support among safety net
patients with chronic pain. Methods: This study uses mixed methods and a pragmatic 2x2 randomized
factorial trial to test two group-based models: integrative group medical visits (IGMV) and group acupuncture.
The study tests the hypotheses that compared with usual care, each study intervention improves pain
interference and social isolation (primary outcomes), and that the two combined have synergistic effects
mediated by increased social support and decreased impact of intersectional stigma among safety net patients
with chronic pain. Study interventions include 12 weekly sessions based on existing protocols tested in primary
care safety net settings. IGMV includes pain education, social and behavioral support, and mind-body
approaches (meditation, yoga). Group acupuncture uses responsive manualization, allowing for a standardized
yet individualized treatment. During the R61 phase, a panel of national experts and patient stakeholders will
refine and optimize the structure, process, and content of IGMV aimed at reducing social isolation and
intersectional stigma as part of pain management. Interventions will be piloted in 40 English or Spanish
speaking patients with chronic pain at two primary care safety net clinics. Study procedures will be tested and
adapted for a larger scale trial. In the R33 phase, 360 participants will be recruited from two safety net clinics
and randomized to IGMV, group acupuncture, both, or neither. Aim 1 is to determine the effects of study
interventions on pain-related outcomes (primary outcomes: pain interference and social isolation). Aim 2 tests
social support and stigma as intervention mediators. Aim 3 examines patient experiences with pain
management, patient-clinician relationships, and clinical care in primary care safety net settings using
qualitative methods. Significance: Multilevel approaches are need to advance health equity in pain
management. The proposed study will contribute to knowledge of group-based integrative pain management
co-located in primary care to address disparities in pain care for socioeconomically vulnerable populations."
10731058,"Romantic relationship distress is a common impairment among Veterans struggling with depression,
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol misuse, and suicide risk. In a study of Veterans who screened
positive for the above concerns in primary care, 58% of partnered Veterans reported romantic relationship
problems. Relationship problems are also a prominent risk factor for suicide, preceding 24% of Veteran suicide
deaths and 50% for Veterans 18-35. Conversely, full participation in mutually supportive relationships confers
protection against suicide. This suggests we may be able to offset risk by turning distressed relationships into
protective partnerships. Unfortunately, the intensive formats of existing couple therapies result in couples
discontinuing after 2-3 sessions or delaying treatment until they are close to breakup. This underscores the need
for brief relationship support that is accessible through primary care mental health (PC-MHI).
 The Brief Relationship Checkup (BRC) is a three 30-minute session intervention to address relationship
distress. BRC incorporates a combination of couple therapy and motivational interviewing techniques to
encourage couples to make concrete commitments to improve their relationship. BRC demonstrates efficacy in
reducing suicide risk factors such as relationship dysfunction and promoting protective factors such as mutual
responsiveness to one another’s concerns, a core element of supportive relationships. Earlier Checkup programs
have also been shown to increase individual and couple therapy engagement and reduce depressive symptoms.
In an open label pilot trial, we found BRC was feasible and acceptable to Veterans screening positive on VHA
mental health primary screens. We also found its highly structured framework could be learned by trainees
without prior couple therapy experience.
RESEARCH PLAN: We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of BRC administered to 72 couples to
evaluate its ability to modify suicide risk/protective factors. Participants will be screened by phone to identify
couples that are in distressed committed relationship where at least one partner is a Veteran (the “Target
Veteran”) who screens positive on a primary care mental health screen for common suicide risk factors (i.e.,
suicide ideation, depression, PTSD, alcohol misuse). We will randomize couples to BRC or to three sessions of
the current PC-MHI Co-Located Collaborative Care model (CCC) for the Veteran partner only. All participants
will complete baseline, post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month assessments. The study will provide the
foundations for a larger clinical trial proposal through pursuit of the following research aims and hypotheses (H):
AIM 1: Determine BRC’s efficacy in improving relationship factors related to suicide for both partners.
 H1a. Couples in BRC will report greater reductions in relationship dysfunction than those in CCC.
 H1b. Couples in BRC will report greater increases in mutual responsiveness than those in CCC.
AIM 2: Determine BRC’s efficacy in improving individual factors related to suicide for the Target Veteran.
 H2a. Target Veterans in BRC will show greater therapy utilization via chart review than those in CCC.
 Sub-aim 2b. Estimate associations between Target Veterans’ BRC participation and change in mental health
 symptoms associated with suicide risk (i.e., depression; PTSD; and alcohol misuse).
 Sub-aim 2c. Explore associations between change in risk factors and changes in Veteran suicide ideation.
AIM 3: Develop and validate a fidelity codebook to operationalize BRC adherence and clinician competency.
CAREER PLAN: Dr. Crasta will use each of the above research aims as an opportunity to pursue the
complementary training aims that were selected based on a prevention science framework:
 Training Aim 1: Gain experience designing and conducting dyadic RCTs in a suicide prevention context.
 Training Aim 2: Develop expertise in analyzing clinical trial data.
 Training Aim 3: Learn the fundamentals of developing implementable interventions."
10738752,"Project Summary/Abstract:
SMARCB1 (SNF5/INI1/BAF47) is a conserved subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, which
utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mobilize nucleosomes. A role for SWI/SNF complexes in cancer was
first suggested when SMARCB1 was identified as inactivated in virtually all cases of malignant rhabdoid tumor
(RT), a highly aggressive pediatric cancer. It has recently been discovered that nearly 25% of all human
malignancies carry mutations in SWI/SNF subunits. We established SMARCB1 to be a bona fide and potent
tumor suppressor and later demonstrated broad epigenetic antagonism between SWI/SNF and Polycomb
repressor complexes during oncogenic transformation. In subsequent work, including substantial progress in
the current funding period, we uncovered novel biological mechanisms and therapeutic vulnerabilities that form
the foundation for the aims described in this proposal. For example, we found that SMARCB1 is essential for
enhancer regulation, thus identifying a new mechanism underlying the tumor-suppressive activity of
SMARCB1. We and others also discovered the existence of a SWI/SNF complex that lacks SMARCB1,
previously considered a core subunit. Instead, this non-canonical complex contains the bromodomain protein
BRD9, which we also identified as a specific vulnerability in SMARCB1-deficient pediatric RTs. While our
findings demonstrate critical interactions of SWI/SNF and Polycomb complexes in transcriptional regulation
and cell fate control, the roles and contributions of SWI/SNF sub-families are unknown. Our first aim is
therefore to determine how SMARCB1-containing SWI/SNF complexes differ from mutually-exclusive BRD9-
containing SWI/SNF complexes in the antagonism of Polycomb interactions and transcriptional regulation.
Recent data from our group have shown that SWI/SNF complexes control histone acetylation and enhancer
function; however, the mechanism by which this leads to a mitotically heritable cancer phenotype is unknown.
Polycomb complexes remain bound to DNA during mitosis, but histone acetylation is erased and the SWI/SNF
ATPase, SMARCA4/BRG1 is phosphorylated and degraded. Thus, for our second aim, we propose to
determine how SWI/SNF complexes contribute to epigenetic memory during mitosis, including interrogating a
potentially paradigm-shifting model that is supported by preliminary data described in this proposal. Finally, we
identified the Polycomb subunit EZH2 as a vulnerability in RTs, inspiring the development of several clinical
trials and leading to recent FDA approval of EZH2 inhibitors for SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas. While
impactful, resistance to these inhibitors has emerged. To establish mechanisms driving drug resistance, we
have performed a near genome-wide CRISPR screen in EZH2 inhibitor-treated RTs, and for our third aim plan
to investigate the mechanism of resistance conferred by mutations in a gene not previously associated with
SWI/SNF functions. Taken together, these questions have potential for broad and substantive impact in
understanding the roles of these critical chromatin remodeling complexes in normal cells and in transformation."
10756439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Administrative Core will coordinate the administrative, fiscal, and organization aspects of
our PPG program. Personnel in this Core will facilitate scientific communication among the
clinical and laboratory sites of the project, and will provide support services to each of the
projects. Investigators in the Department of Pediatrics have faculty appointments at UW and
scientific appointments at SCRI and SCH. Collaborative scientific projects involving
investigators at SCRI, SCH, and UW are frequent, and the administrative staff at the have
excellent working relationships, such that tasks such as inter-institutional financial and
budgetary management are routine.
As the overall Program Director, Dr. David Beier is responsible for scientific overview of the
project, for overall budgetary and administrative matters, and for insuring the investigators
adhere to the highest ethical standards in conducting their research. All of the senior
investigators, Dr. Katrina Dipple, Dr. Jay Shendure, and Dr. Murat Maga, have experience with
interdisciplinary multi-investigator, multi-site projects and are well-suited for the collaborative
effort that we are proposing.
In addition to logistic and financial management of the PPG, the Administrative Core will
facilitate inter-project communication and meetings. To facilitate dissemination of results to the
community, the Core will also assist in the organization of a local annual meeting that we
anticipate will be of interest to the large number of investigators interested in technological
development and its application to understanding mammalian development and human disease.
Finally, the Core will facilitate the participation in the PPG of underrepresented minority students
via the SCRI-sponsored URM Summer Internship Program."
10756442,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project we plan to apply a powerful and scaleable technique of combinatorial indexing to characterize
gene expression at the single-cell level in mice carrying mutations that are either known to or likely to result in
structural birth defects. We propose to assess whether single-cell expression can be utilized as a phenotype;
specifically, we aim to organize these data sets to assess whether there are signatures of single-cell gene
expression that facilitate grouping mutant lines based on presumptive pathways of developmental signaling
perturbation. This analysis will be complemented by the anatomical analysis that is proposed in Project 2.
Given the novelty of this method, we will initially analyze 10 lines that are mutated for genes in the Shh
signaling pathway, in order to correlate single-cell transcriptomic data with well-studied developmental
phenotypes. To maximize the opportunity for new gene discovery, we will also examine novel genes that have
not been previously annotated with respect to human structural birth defects. Specifically, using an analysis of
human exome sequencing data, we have identified a large cohort of genes that are likely haploinsufficient; i.e.,
they are not compatible with survival when heterozygous null. We have furthermore developed a heterozygote
selection (shet) statistic that correlates remarkably well with human disease severity. We aim to characterize 75
lines from the top quintile shet set that have limited functional annotation; these genes will be chosen either a)
based on evidence from single-cell expression during embryogenesis (Cao et al. 2019) that they are novel cell-
type-specific index genes or b) are known lethal genes (in mice) that have a high frequency of protein
interactions.
As part of this effort we will develop bioinformatic tools to facilitate comparisons across different datasets.
These can identify mutant lines with common abnormalities of developmental signaling, as well as potentially
serving as a means to understand the mechanistic basis for human congenital abnormalities."
10756450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural birth defects (SBD) affect 3-6% of live births and are a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Most SBD are isolated, occur in the first 10 weeks of human development, and are thought to be
driven by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.
Technical advances in DNA sequencing have propelled our understanding of the genetics of SBD. Array based
technologies identified copy number variants that contribute to SBD and enabled genome wide association
studies. Massively parallel “Next Generation” (NGS) methods sequence large numbers of short (50-300 base
pairs) pieces of DNA simultaneously, permitting sequencing of all coding regions (the exome) or the entire
genome at once. Exome and genome sequencing of blood-derived DNA identifies the molecular etiology of
~50% of children multisystemic, syndromic SBD. However, the etiology of most SBD- both isolated and
syndromic- remains unknown.
A potential reason for this is that short-read based sequencing of blood-derived DNA does not provide a
comprehensive view of an individual’s genome.
The goal of this proposal is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with SBD to identify
genetic variation not identified by current methods. These “hidden” variants include duplications, inversions,
repeat expansions/contractions, and epigenetic modifications that standard short-read based methods cannot
identify (Aim 1). Hidden variants also include DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically (“mosaic”) and are not
present in blood-derived DNA (Aim 2).
We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) on patients
with syndromic SBD whose clinical workup (including exome sequencing) has been non-diagnostic. In patients
with isolated SBD whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic, we will apply deep short-read based DNA
sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues to identify mosaic variants.
This proposal aligns with the stated goals of the NICHD, as our findings will form the basis of new strategies for
the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human structural birth defects. Our work furthers that goal by
identifying previously undetected genetic variation in children with SBD. This is a key first step towards
establishing a framework for utilizing these novel technologies in the clinical diagnostic arena."
10766712,"Abstract
 In an increasingly aging and obese population, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and osteoporotic fractures are major public health
concerns. Affecting more than 1 in 3 adults in the United States, obesity is the most important risk factor for T2DM. It is
now well established that obesity and T2DM have effects on fracture risk, and fractures in T2DM are associated with greater
morbidity than in the general population. Although bone density is generally known to be increased in obese and T2DM
patients, the underpinning causes that contribute to increased fracture risk in T2DM/obese subjects remain to be established.
Therefore, understanding the interactions of obesity, T2DM and fracture is becoming a pressing need to reduce the societal
and individual costs of fracture. Our efforts to identify control molecules and their signaling pathways that delineate a link
between T2DM, osteoporosis and obesity led to the exciting discovery that targeted disruption of kinase suppressor of Ras
2 (Ksr2), an obesity and T2DM gene, led to a >2-fold increase in trabecular bone mass at the distal femur of 4-month-old
mice besides inducing obesity and T2DM. By contrast, disruption of a closely related Ksr1 gene had no significant effect
on bone or obese phenotypes. KSR1 and 2 were discovered as scaffolding proteins that orchestrate the assembly of Raf,
MEK and ERK in the canonical Ras-Raf-MAPKs pathway. While a central role for Ksr2 expressed in hypothalamus has
been implicated in the control of feeding behavior and energy balance and, thereby obesity, we have new exciting
preliminary data that suggest that KSR2 expressed in osteoblasts acts locally in a cell autonomous fashion to regulate its
functions. Based on our preliminary data and published data, we propose a novel hypothesis that KSR2 regulates osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation via regulating mTORC1 signaling and its downstream hypoxia signaling. In this
competitive renewal RO1 application, we will test this model of KSR2 action as follows: 1) To test the hypothesis that
KSR2 acts in a cell autonomous fashion to regulate trabecular bone formation, we will generate osteoblast-specific Ksr2
conditional knockout mice and characterize its skeletal phenotype by micro-CT, histology, mechanical testing and gene
expression. 2) To test the hypothesis that KSR2 effects on osteoblasts are mediated via its regulation of mTORC1 signaling,
we will determine the functional consequence of KSR2/mTORC1 pathway interactions by evaluating if knockdown of
Raptor in osteoblasts abolishes the increased anabolic functions of Ksr2 knockdown osteoblasts. 3) To test the hypothesis
that KSR2/mTORC1 effects on osteoblasts are mediated via HIF1α signaling, we will evaluate changes in hypoxia signaling
in osteoblasts with conditional disruption of Ksr2 and/or Raptor. We will also determine if disruption of Hif1α expression
in osteoblasts rescues the skeletal phenotype in osteoblast-specific Ksr2 conditional knockout mice. Successful completion
of our proposed studies will provide important information on the pathway/s by which KSR2 regulates osteoblast and bone
marrow adipocyte functions and could lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms linking obesity and a high bone
mass phenotype."

coordination, and administrative oversight to achieve the programmatic goals of the Harvard Aging Brain Study
(HABS) Program Project Grant (PPG). The Admin Core will strive to ensure optimal integration of the five
Cores and four research Projects of the HABS PPG renewal to achieve maximal scientific productivity. Aim 1:
The Admin Core is led by the Co-Principal Investigators (Sperling/Johnson) and will provide administrative and
scientific oversight of the PPG. The Admin Core, through the co-PIs of the PPG, will take primary responsibility
for ensuring scientific rigor and reproducibility across all aspects of the HABS PPG. The Core will coordinate
quarterly meetings of the Executive Committee and will convene in-person meetings of the External Scientific
Advisory Board (ESAB). Aim 2: The Admin Core will facilitate the efficient communication and integration
between all components of the PPG, provide oversight of timely data transfer from all Cores and Projects to
the Analytic Core to achieve maximal scientific productivity, and track all scientific presentations and
publications. Aim 3: The Admin Core will prepare NIH progress reports, interface with the Clinical Core to
prepare IRB documentation and annual continuing review, and with the Imaging Core to prepare annual
reports to the MGH Radioactive Drug Research Committee. Aim 4: The Admin Core will oversee all aspects of
the PPG finances to assure fiscal responsibility. Aim 5: The Admin Core will serve to coordinate PPG
interactions with institutional resources and programs, including the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (MADRC), the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH), and the MGH PET Core. Aim 6: The Admin Core will serve to facilitate collaborations between the
PPG and related scientific initiatives within Harvard and the larger scientific community, providing oversight of
the rapidly increasing number of requests for collaborations and data sharing. The Admin Core seeks to
enhance the coordination of an outstanding multidisciplinary group of investigators with a strong record of
collaboration and scientific productivity. The Admin Core will serve to maximize the knowledge gained from the
rich longitudinal data from the well-characterized HABS cohort to improve our understanding of the gradual
transition from normal aging to the earliest stages of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and inform the
design and analytic strategies for ongoing and future prevention trials. Given the multitude of recent
disappointing results from clinical trials in the symptomatic stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), our continued
work to elucidate the impact of amyloid and tau pathology on the aging brain, and new research initiatives to
better understand the many factors that modulate cognitive decline, are more important than ever."
10775722,"SUMMARY: CORE B- CLINICAL CORE. The Clinical Core will support the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS)
Program Project Grant (PPG) by retaining a diverse sample of older individuals (Aim 1), carefully evaluating
them with annual neuropsychological and clinical assessments, and scheduling all procedures (Aim 2),
obtaining biological fluid samples (Aim 3), facilitating brain donations (Aim 4) and providing clinical and
neuropsychological expertise to all Projects (Aim 5). Individuals recruited during the first grant cycle (Wave 1:
2010-2015; n=285) now have 7-9 years of longitudinal follow-up. Individuals recruited during the second grant
cycle (Wave 2: 2015-current; n=88) allowed us to replenish the cohort, expand the age range down to 50 and
add a new Latino/a group. We have maintained an average attrition rate of 5.8±4.6% per year over nine years.
Our Active Cohort now includes 290 individuals (mean age 70.6±9.4 years, current age range 51-94). The
representation of minorities in the sample is now 22%, exceeding the proportion of older minority populations in
the greater Boston area. Although participants were all clinically normal when they joined HABS, 13.2% of
participants have progressed to a CDR of 0.5, with 10.3% reaching a clinical consensus diagnosis of MCI or
mild dementia, and we anticipate that an increasingly proportion of the cohort individuals will decline over the
next 5 years. Retention and careful evaluation of the HABS cohort is essential to achieve the scientific goals of
our study. In addition to performing annual assessments of cognition, mood, social engagement, quality of life,
activities of daily living and subjective cognitive concerns and scheduling imaging procedures with the Imaging
Core, the Clinical Core will work with Project 2 to monitor physical activity, facilitate recruitment into the
Advanced Imaging Cohort for Project 3 and assist Project 4 with training on mobile computerized assessments
that will be administered in the home environment. The Clinical Core will collect biological fluid samples for
biomarker and genetic studies in coordination with the Biomarker Core and facilitate discussion of brain
donation and coordination of successful autopsy completion with the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center’s Neuropathology Core for Project 1. Finally, the Clinical Core will ensure reliable data
collection, quality control of all clinical data, and will input and transfer data to DataCentral in coordination with
the Analytic Core. The Clinical Core is comprised of a seasoned group of multidisciplinary clinical investigators
with specialized training in neurology, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry, along with a dedicated staff of
research assistants. The Clinical Core will facilitate the careful longitudinal characterization of HABS
participants, including determination/adjudication of MCI or dementia diagnosis made by consensus with our
multidisciplinary clinical investigators who are blind to biomarker status. The Clinical Core and the HABS PPG
seek to improve our understanding of the aging brain, and the role of amyloid, tau and vascular pathologies
that may be involved in imminent and clinically meaningful cognitive decline."

mDOT – Administration Core
Abstract:
The mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions (the mDOT
Center) will enable a new paradigm of temporally-precise medicine to maintain health and manage the growing
burden of chronic diseases. The mDOT Center will develop and disseminate the methods, tools, and
infrastructure necessary for researchers to pursue the discovery, optimization and translation of temporally-
precise mHealth interventions. Such interventions, when dynamically personalized to the moment-to-moment
biopsychosocial-environmental context of each individual, will precipitate a much-needed transformation in
healthcare by enabling patients to initiate and sustain the healthy lifestyle choices necessary for directly
managing, treating, and in some cases even preventing the development of medical conditions. Organized
around three Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects, mDOT represents a unique national
resource that will develop multiple technological innovations and support their translation into research and
practice by the mHealth community in the form of easily deployable wearables, apps for wearables and
smartphones, and a companion mHealth cloud system, all open-source.
Given that the inherently transdisciplinary, team-based nature of mHealth research requires scientists to cross
disciplinary and institutional boundaries, administration and operation of a functional resource center in mHealth
technologies requires a collaborative culture, with a team-science approach, that is geographically dispersed yet
functional in a virtual setting. mDOT will utilize its established and highly successful infrastructure, adaptive
procedural acumen, widely visible dissemination platforms, and deeply-experienced team to develop
administrative and operational policies and procedures relevant to the running of a national resource center. The
Administration Core will look to not only enhance the research of the collaborative projects (CPs) and service
projects (SPs), but also to streamline communication and involvement with new research groups with little or no
technological expertise. To achieve its goals, mDOT will pursue the following activities. First, mDOT will leverage
an established organizing structure and managerial practice to facilitate coordination, communication, and
collaboration among the team, CPs, SPs, and greater research community. Secondly, mDOT will establish
operational procedures that allows for successful work with the CPs and SPs – this includes mechanisms to
receive, vet, and approve the use of resources and devising criteria to prioritize the selection of other qualified
CP/SP candidates. Third, mDOT will recruit eminent scholars and nationally recognized thought leaders to serve
on a diverse external advisory committee (EAC) tasked with providing feedback and guidance on the mDOT
research agenda. Fourth, mDOT will secure and leverage institutional support that accommodates and sets up
the Center for success in achieving the research goals put forth by the investigating team. Finally, the
Administration Core will develop measurable metrics to monitor, assess, and evaluate the quality and utility of
mDOT technologies while taking a customer service approach that is adaptive to feedback and responsive to
the mHealth research community at large.

The Imaging Core supports the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) Program Project Grant (PPG) by
overseeing the acquisition and analyses of all imaging protocols. For the renewal, the Imaging Core will have
primary responsibility for the acquisition of the PET protocols for both 11C Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and
18F Flortaucipir (FTP). The Core will be responsible for acquisition and analytic processing of the BASE MRI
sequences to generate standard volumetric MRI variables for all HABS participants, including sampling of PET
in MRI-defined regions-of-interest (ROI). The Core will provide BASE protocol image data for use with the
ADVANCED Imaging protocol (Project 3), which includes FDG, R1, and TARP. All Core image data will be
integrated with data from Core B: Clinical Core within the DataCentral database with oversight by Core D:
Analytic Core. In conjunction with the Analytic Core, personnel from each of Projects 1 through 4 will be able
to query the database to acquire fully quality-controlled image data for use in testing individual Project
hypotheses. For the primary assessments of amyloid and tau deposition, the Core will provide a standard full
dynamic protocol for PiB PET and a standard late-frame protocol for FTP PET (Aim 1). The BASE MRI
protocol will consist of a standardized set of structural and functional acquisitions for subject characterization,
including subcortical volumetrics, e.g., hippocampus, and cortical thickness (Aim 1). Standard measures
derived from these data sets by the Core will be used by all four Projects to accomplish individual Project aims
(Aim 2). These include proxy measures of amyloid and tau realized as PET metrics in individual or aggregated
tissue ROI, e.g., global amyloid burden represented as PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR), or regional tau
burden represented as inferior temporal FTP standardized uptake ratio (SUVr). The processing pipelines have
been automated using a combination of tools based on FreeSurfer, SPM12, FSL, and in-house scripts and
programs. The Imaging Core will supply the four PPG Projects with quality-checked MRI and PET ROI data
that has been archived and managed under the supervision of the Analytic Core. The Imaging Core is
composed of a strong group of clinical neuroimaging investigators, with specialized training in radiology,
neurology, psychology, informatics, and computer science, who will supervise a dedicated research staff to
perform MRI and PET acquisitions, data processing, and analyses in close collaboration with the research
Projects. The Imaging Core will assist individual Projects to optimize each imaging measure for use in specific
analyses."

TR&D1 will develop, evaluate and disseminate methods to analyze population-scale multi-modal time series of
mHealth biomarkers to enable research on identifying the momentary risk factors and risk dynamics that drive
adverse health outcomes, while accounting for the uncertainty and missingness inherent in these data sources.
TR&D1 will do this under three aims. Aim 1 will address missing sensor data in mHealth field studies and develop
state-of-the art imputation models using novel deep probabilistic neural networks that leverage the hierarchical
nature of biomarker computation graphs. Aim 2 will address compressing a collection of biomarkers that serve
as risk factors for a particular adverse health event into a single risk score, to support the online adaptation of
decision rules in TR&D2, using longitudinal data that include multiple instances of adverse events and their
contexts. In addition to risk scoring, we will also develop models for receptivity to intervention and participant
engagement, which complement the assessment of risk in guiding intervention design. Aim 3 will begin to tackle
the critical issue of providing model-based tools for identifying which potential risk factors actually impact risk in
different contexts for different individuals, in order to support the intervention design process. TR&D1 will work
with its collaborative projects to ensure that it focuses on the most pressing problems facing the mobile health
research community. TR&D1 will disseminate its technologies to service projects and the community as software
packages and cloud-based data analysis tools, to ensure the usability of these technologies by investigators who

of data from the Cores and Projects is central to the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS). The Data Core
provides the database and statistical support for these functions. The Core has developed and optimized: (i)
the DataCentral database for data entry, quality assurance, storage, backup, security, and query systems, as
well as linkage to raw and processed image files, (ii) data distribution for biostatistical analyses to support the
project aims, and (iii) blinding to prevent inadvertent bias. The Core also supports, designs, and implements
analyses that contribute to the definition and quantification of critical disease pathologies, brain networks,
biomarkers, and their interactions, and participates in the selection of subsets of the sample for additional
procedures or specific analyses, as needed. We also develop summary measures of brain pathologies and
network disruption that can be used in a wide variety of analyses within and across projects, address methods
needed for time-to-event and longitudinal analyses across multiple nonlinear processes within the aging brain,
and develop models to address questions of causal inference. The Specific Aims of the Data Core are: 1. Data
Integrity and Integration, which includes data entry, quality control, and storage; data access and distribution;
and data sharing; 2. Statistical Support, Oversight, and Analysis, which involves statistical support for the
Projects and Cores including simulation-guided study design and data analysis, and use of modern
epidemiologic methods in causal inference to inform model construction, mediation analyses, and adjustment
for selection bias and confounding, and 3. Development of Innovative Statistical Models and Methods, which
includes joint modeling of PiB, FTP, functional connectivity and cognitive measures; treatment of misaligned
biomarker measurements; modeling of censored time-to-event data that adjusts for delayed entry; derivation of
efficient prevention trial populations and endpoints; and development of new methods for adjusting for
selection bias in the setting of change-in-change analyses. Overall, the overarching responsibilities of the Data
Core are to: manage the large and complex array of data that continues to be collected in the project, including
neuroimaging data, clinical data, genetic, and biofluid data; integrate all data elements into a single database;
and oversee and facilitate the statistical analyses for each Project--and across projects--using optimal analytic

Core (Core B) from individuals (ages 50 to 94). Assays will be conducted on these biofluids to generate data
on amyloid-b (""A""), tau (""T"") and neurodegeneration (""N"") (Aim 2) and data on vascular injury and immune

includes over 1300 biofluid samples (blood and CSF) from 373 participants in Grant Cycles 1 and 2, and will
bank additional longitudinal samples over the next cycle. Bloods have been processed into plasma, serum,
whole blood, buffy coat, RNA, miRNA, DNA and cell lines, and CSFs are collected, processed and stored
according to best practices to minimize pre-analytical variability. ATN data has been generated using ultra-
sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology with assays for Ab42, NT1 tau and neurofilament-light (NfL)
in all samples to date as well as modifying factor data for vascular injury and immune response using
electrochemiluminescence ELISA. Samples have been distributed to collaborating scientists for additional

reinforcement learning (RL) when applied to personalize mobile interventions to individuals. Two of these
limitations are related to the need to increase efficacy and reduce negative delayed intervention burden effects
leading to disengagement. The third looks to future needs involving the personalization of multiple intervention
components each operating at a different time scale. In particular, we will accommodate the ever-present mobile
health challenge of user disengagement by developing a continuum of approaches between RL algorithms that
ignore delayed intervention effects and RL algorithms that attempt to capture noisy delayed intervention effects
over a more distant future. Second, we will increase the rate at which personalization occurs via optimally
leveraging data across time and across users to more quickly personalize the interventions to each user. Third,
we will develop the first RL approaches to coherently personalize multiple intervention components holistically.
In addition, to enhance impact and dissemination, the methods will be developed in close collaboration with three
collaborative projects with an emphasis on model interpretability. We will provide the two service projects and
the broader research community with open-source software tools and systems consisting of smartphone and

10775735,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 1- AMYLOID AND TAU PET
Trajectories of aβ and tau deposition can now be related to each other and to other biomarkers of preclinical
AD as well as to clinical endpoints. Recent therapeutic trial failures highlight the critical need for a better
understanding of how changing levels of pathology relate to each other and to clinical outcomes. Unfortunately,
these relationships are complex, and optimized measures permitting robust tracking of dynamics remain
underdeveloped, posing a barrier to efficient, rapid progress toward successful therapeutics. Initial study of
these trajectories in HABS indicated that earlier aβ increase was detectable but was not associated with
cognitive decline until a later observation period, during which time the decline was mediated by concurrent
measures of tau accumulation. In the proposed HABS Cycle 3, Project 1 will focus on the progression and
interrelated dynamics of aβ and tau pathologies assessed with PET acquired in the Imaging Core to identify
stages of pathologic progression. We will leverage the HABS sample, with 9 years of amyloid and 4 years of
tau PET follow up along with longitudinal neuropsychological data to characterize stages of progression in
terms of time (Aim 1) and space (Aim 2), as well as explore novel plasma measures for manifestations of these
stages (exploratory Aim 3). Specifically, HABS participants will undergo serial imaging with 11C Pittsburgh
Compound B and 18F Flortaucipir PET with Aim 1, to characterize the temporal trajectory of each pathology,
relate these trajectories to each other, identify dynamic connections between each that progress in successive
intervals, and relate these findings to age, sex, and APOE genotype; Aim 2, to identify the specific anatomy of
aβ and tau progression based on serial measures; and Aim 3 (Exploratory), investigate the associations of aβ
and tau level and change measured with PET to measures obtained with blood biomarkers, and to correlate
findings with autopsy brains as they become available. Project 1 will contribute to the overall Program goals:
together we will assess the impact of modulating factors (Project 2) as well as the functional links (Project 3)
that relate pathologic change to clinical phenotype (Project 4). Together, this research will ultimately improve
sampling for clinical trials and therapeutic targeting strategies."

biopsychosocial-environmental context of each individual, will precipitate a much-needed transformation in
healthcare by enabling patients to initiate and sustain the healthy lifestyle choices necessary for directly
managing, treating, and in some cases even preventing the development of medical conditions. Organized
around three Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects, mDOT represents a unique national
resource that will develop multiple methodological and technological innovations and support their translation
into research and practice by the mHealth community in the form of easily deployable wearables, apps for
wearables and smartphones, and a companion mHealth cloud system, all open-source.
TR&D3 will develop, validate and disseminate algorithms, tools and software/hardware designs for translation of
temporally-precise mHealth interventions through resource efficient, real time, low-latency and privacy-aware
implementation of an array of digital biomarkers that can be deployed at scale. Our approach is centered around
a hierarchical computing framework that reduces the data into minimal modular abstractions called Micromarkers
computed at the edge devices (Aim 1). Modular Micromarker abstractions are used to compress task-specific
information relevant to biomarker computations at the edge devices while stripping nuisance variables such as
hardware biases/drifts and background levels not pertinent to inference. Our hierarchical computing framework
can be extended to implement high data rate sensor arrays at edge devices to be used at new point of care and
ambulatory settings. This is accomplished through integrating a compressive sensing pre-processor to achieve
signal acquisition in a resource constrained setting (Aim 2). Finally, TR&D3 will create computational
mechanisms and a general biomarker privacy framework to enable participant control over the privacy-utility
trade-offs during study design, data collection, and sharing of collected mHealth data for third party research
when data cross trust domains (Aim 3).
These technologies will be developed in collaboration with collaborative projects and will be disseminated to
service projects to ensure that TR&D3 technologies can solve real problems facing the health research
community and ensure the usability of these technologies by investigators who are external to the mDOT
investigating team. TR&D3 will synergistically work in partnership with the other TR&D projects, the Training and
Dissemination Core, and the Administration Core to maximize the societal impact of TR&D3 technologies.

Parental care is critical to the health of both parents and offspring, yet little is known about how molecular substrates act within brain areas and neuronal circuits to alter parental behavior, and this gap is especially wide for paternal care, i.e. the care-giving behavior of fathers. The proposed research capitalizes on natural variation in paternal care within a single species (threespined stickleback fish) to uncover the biological basis of paternal care in vertebrates. The current models for paternal care have biparental care, which makes it difficult to disentangle the behavior of mothers and fathers. Three-spined stickleback fish are a promising new model for paternal care because fathers are solely responsible for providing care. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms related to care are deeply conserved in vertebrates, the stickleback genome is small and compact and there are a growing number of functional tools available to study them. The goals of this proposal are to define the molecular elements responsible for differences in paternal care within a single species and to characterize the neurobiological pathways involved in such variation in behavior. There are two objectives: 1) Identify genes that contribute to differences in paternal care and test their function; 2) Define the ways in which neuropeptide signaling regulates paternal care. The project combines brain gene expression profiling at the bulk and single cell level, viral mediated transgenesis experiments to establish mechanism and pharmacological manipulations of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin signaling. The proposed work offers an innovative solution to the challenge of dissecting the biological basis of paternal care by using a powerful new model for fathering, and by capitalizing on natural variation in paternal care within a single species."

Iran has the highest burden of HIV in the Middle East. However, only 42% of Iranians living with HIV are
diagnosed and 28% on antiretroviral therapy. The largest gap in the continuum of HIV care is diagnosis. Due to
sociocultural and religious beliefs, HIV-associated stigma and drug use stigma are exceedingly high, and sex
outside of marriage, or sex of man with another man are considered to be “sinful” behaviors. These intersectional
stigmas (stigma towards drug use, sexism, and homophobia) in addition to HIV stigma are major barriers for
many people at risk for or living with HIV to engage in HIV testing or treatment. Our prior studies found that
health providers have limited clinical encounters with people living with HIV (PLWH) and have no HIV stigma
training. This lack of training can lead to stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards people at risk for HIV or
PLWH. The highest HIV stigmatizing behaviors was reported in nurses and physician assistants. These data,
coupled with the extreme marginalization of key populations at high risk for HIV in Iran, call for the development
of new ways to train nurses to reduce HIV-related stigma in clinical settings. We propose to develop, and field
test an HIV stigma online training including simulated patients living with HIV for nursing school students. In a
randomized controlled trial, we will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the online HIV
stigma training in reducing stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors of nursing students in simulated clinical visits of
patients living with HIV compared to an online HIV epidemiology training with no specific content on stigma.
Successful development of the HIV stigma training and simulated patients at risk for or living with HIV will set
the stage for developing a larger trial of nurses and other health providers which can lead to an effective and
scalable training program to reduce HIV-related stigma in clinical settings and improve engagement in HIV testing
and care services."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting roughly 5.8 million people in the
United States. The most effective interventions for AD are pharmaceuticals that include acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of acetylcholine. While these treatments are capable of temporarily
improving the symptoms of disease, they do not halt or reverse AD progression. Several histopathological
hallmarks have been associated with AD, including formation of extracellular Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles,
and accelerated degeneration of basal forebrain neurons (the primary source of acetylcholine in the brain). This
marked degeneration of the basal forebrain has been observed in human AD MRI studies and typically indicates
the advent of early disease. In fact, the degeneration of acetylcholine projecting, or cholinergic neurons in this
region that is believed to be an important underlying cause of the cognitive deficits that emerge as disease
progresses. However, human studies are limited, as we are not able to examine brain degeneration with cell
type specificity using currently available imaging modalities. This highlights an important gap in our
understanding of AD: it is unknown whether basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) degeneration occurs in
an organized manner, nor how the extent of this degeneration correlates to cognitive deficits. Therefore, further
investigation of BFCNs in the context of AD is needed. This leads to our central hypothesis: that BFCN
signaling is adversely altered in a consistent temporal and spatial pattern, and that stimulating BFCN
activity will mitigate cognitive symptoms. The overarching goal of this project is to better characterize BFCN
signaling in the pathological context of AD. This will be examined through two primary aims, both of which utilize
the 5xFAD model of AD, a transgenic mouse model known for rapid manifestation of the AD phenotype and has
been shown to exhibit BFCN degeneration. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will investigate longitudinal
alterations in BFCN circuitry by leveraging myriad targeted cellular manipulations to perform in vivo fMRI of
BFCN functional connectivity in awake mice, and to generate a timeline of molecular profiles for BFCNs using
TRAP-seq. Aim 2 will explore how artificially stimulating and silencing BFCNs influences cognitive function in
the context of AD. Together, these data will further our understanding of BFCN degeneration in AD and better
define the roles of BFCNs in cognition."

An evolutionary conserved developmental program is carefully maintained in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Genetic alterations and epigenetic mechanisms can alter the balance of normal blood development resulting in
hematological malignancies. Our laboratory and others have found that the MUSASHI2 (MSI2) RNA binding
proteins is highly expressed in the most aggressive cancers and predicts a poor clinical outcome in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Genetic models have found that MSI2 is required for leukemia stem cell
function. Utilizing a new way to identify mRNA targets of RNA binding proteins, we have found that MSI2
activity is increased in leukemia stem cells compared to normal stem and progenitor cells. This surprising
finding suggests that RNA binding protein function can be dysregulated beyond just expression differences.
We hypothesize that the MSI family of RNA binding protein have differential activity in AML compared to
normal cells and that MSI enhances the dysregulated epigenome in AML. We propose two possible
mechanisms for this intriguing finding 1) MSI2 associated RBPs compete for MSI2-binding sites and 2) Post-
translation modifications can modulate MSI2 activity. Our preliminary data has uncovered that MSI2 can
mediate resistance to PRMT5 and that PRMT1 and PRMT5 can directly methylate MSI2. PRMT5 inhibitors are
being investigated as therapeutic targets and our proposal suggests a novel link to this pathway and may
explain cell context MSI2 activity. Our proposal will utilize new genetic models to characterize MSI2 targets in
specific cellular contexts and explore the MSI2 associated program to identify new therapeutic strategies in
AML."

 During exocytosis, fusion pores form the first aqueous connection that allows escape of neurotransmitters
and hormones from secretory vesicles. Although it is well established that SNARE complexes catalyze fusion,
the structure and composition of fusion pores remain unknown. This is the central question in the field of
membrane fusion, as the mechanism of fusion cannot be solved until the structure of the first key intermediate
in this pathway, the fusion pore, has been elucidated. The main objective of this proposal is to gain new
insights into fusion pore composition, structure, and dynamics, using both reconstitution and cell-based
approaches. A major limitation in the biochemical study of fusion pores in cells concerns their low abundance
and ephemeral nature. For example, in neuroendocrine cells, the duration of the initial open state of the fusion
pore is of the order of msec; the pore then either closes (kiss-and-run exocytosis), or dilates to yield full fusion.
To overcome this limitation, we have begun to study fusion pore structure, in vitro, by exploiting the rigid
framework of nanodiscs. SNARE-bearing proteoliposomes dock and fuse with nanodiscs that harbor cognate
SNAREs. Since nanodiscs are bounded by membrane scaffolding proteins, the pores cannot dilate, and hence
can be studied biochemically. Using this system, we have begun to interrogate the properties of reconstituted
fusion pores. Our preliminary data indicate that, contrary to the common view that fusion pores are purely
lipidic, they are in fact hybrid structures, composed of both lipids and proteins. We will use a simulation
approach to derive a new model for fusion pore structure, and conduct cryo-electron microscopy studies to
visualize this structure. We will also use a variety of cargos of varying diameter, in conjunction with optical
sensors that report their release during fusion, to determine the size of the pore, and to determine whether
pore diameter is `plastic' and varies with the number of SNARE proteins. We will also probe for interactions
between cargo and SNARE transmembrane domains by exploiting electrostatic interactions between them.
The nanodisc system will be adapted to single molecule studies, to monitor pore opening and closing of
individual pores in real-time, and to directly assess the impact of regulatory factors on pore stability. These in
vitro experiments will be complimented by our ongoing direct measurements of fusion pores in chromaffin cells,
using carbon fiber amperometry, by comparing the effects of SNARE mutations in these two systems. We will
draw parallels between these systems so that we can arrive at unified, physiologically relevant models for
pores. Finally, we will also design novel optical probes, based on pH sensitive dyes conjugated to quantum
dots, to study fusion pores in cultured neurons. These latter studies will address the highly controversial topic
of kiss-and-run exocytosis versus full fusion. Together, the work described here will provide unparalleled
comparisons between in vitro and cell based observations, and will reveal new insights in the first crucial
intermediate in the exocytotic pathway: the enigmatic fusion pore."
10745316,"Migraine is one of the top leading causes of disability worldwide. Existing treatments remain elusive for many
patients, and development of novel treatments approaches has been limited due to the incomplete understanding
of migraine pathogenesis.
A large body of work now supports the notion that migraine headache involves the
trigeminal sensory system that innervates the cerebral meninges and their related large vessels, but it remains
unclear how this sensory system becomes activated
during a migraine attack. One leading line of evidence
points to the role of cortical dysfunction in triggering migraine headache, and is supported by the findings that
cortical spreading depression (CSD) can cause the activation and sensitization of neurons in the meningeal
nociceptive pathway. However, CSD is thought to trigger the headache in only the small subset of attacks that
are accompanied by aura. Sensory cortex hyperexcitability has also been documented in migraine without aura.
However, it is unclear whether and how such cortical dysfunction, beyond CSD, might lead to meningeal
nociception and the ensuing generation of headache. The notions that (i) cortical hyperexcitability can drive
abnormal activation of cortical astrocytes via their diverse GPCRs, and (ii) that this would result in excessive
release of numerous astrocytic factors with algesic properties that can propagate into the meninges, has led us
to hypothesize that heightened cortical astrocyte GPCR-linked signaling, unrelated to CSD, is sufficient to drive
the meningeal sensory pathway
. To test our working hypothesis, we will first determine whether selective
activation of sensory cortical astrocyte Gq- and Gi-GPCR pathways are sufficient to drive meningeal nociceptors,
and whether enhanced astrocytic GPCRR-linked
Ca2+ signaling plays a role (Aim 1). We will then examine
whether such enhanced cortical astrocyte signaling can also promote migraine-like pain behaviors (Aim 2).
Because calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is critically involved migraine pathophysiology, but its role is
still not well understood, we will further test whether the cortical astrocyte mediated meningeal nociceptive
responses and related migraine behavioral phenotype involve peripheral CGRP signaling within the intracranial
dura mater (Aim 3). To address these research questions, we will employ a state-of-the-art chemogenetic
DREADD (“designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs”) tools, as well as optogenetics, to
selectively promote activation of astrocyte GPCR pathways. We will combine these approaches with in vivo
extracellular single-unit recording , 2-photon calcium imaging, behavioral approaches, as well as genetic
manipulations to interrogate the meningeal nociceptive consequences of enhanced sensory cortical Gq- and Gi-
linked Ca2+ signaling. Taken together, our proposed research could reveal increased astrocyte GPCR signaling
as a key mechanism that links sensory cortex hyperexcitability and headache genesis in in migraine attacks that
do not involve CSD and aura."
10756115,"ABSTRACT
The ability of mammalian cells to elicit inflammation is central to many processes including embryogenesis,
wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. A major source of inflammatory signaling is the
aberrant presence of double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. Mammalian cells have evolved high-
ly conserved mechanisms to detect cytosolic nucleic acids as an anti-viral defense. In normal cells, cGAS (cy-
clic GMP-AMP synthase) and its downstream signaling effector STING (stimulator of interferon genes) have
been proposed as essential mediators of type I interferon (IFN) signaling and downstream immune activation.
We have shown however, that in cancer cells with chromosomal instability (CIN), there is no evidence of type I
IFN signaling despite the presence of cytosolic DNA and constitutive activation of cGAS and STING. Instead,
cancer cells rewire their signaling downstream of STING to selectively suppress IFN signaling and enable oth-
er pro-metastatic pathways such as NF-κB. Three important pieces of evidence bring into question the essen-
tiality of the cGAS-STING pathway in promoting anti-tumor immunity and suggest heretofore unappreciated
redundancies and context dependence of nucleic acid sensing in cancer: 1) chromosomally unstable cancer
cells retain IFN-responsiveness to cytosolic dsRNA. 2) Cancer cells with CIN can still elicit a robust, anti-tumor
immune response to cytosolic dsDNA, in a manner independent of cGAS-STING and type I IFN. 3) Expression
of nucleic acid sensors and downstream inflammatory pathways is highly variable across tumor subpopulations
and metastatic cell states – in which a continuum of stem-like to more committed epithelial progenitors is ob-
served. Together, these findings challenge the current view that cGAS-STING signaling is the universal media-
tor of inflammation in response to cytosolic dsDNA. Herein, we aim to understand functional redundancies and
interactions across cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways and how their transcriptional outputs vary with tu-
mor cell differentiation status. We will systematically interrogate key nucleic acid sensors and their downstream
effectors in three syngeneic mouse models characterized by increased metastatic potential and high levels of
CIN. We will experimentally manipulate CIN rates to identify cytosolic nucleic acid-dependent, but cGAS-
STING-independent mechanisms of immune activation (Aim 1). We will then couple high-throughput single-cell
sequencing with combinatorial CRISPR-mediated gene inactivation of key cytosolic nucleic acid sensors and
effectors in metastasis-initiating stem cells distinguished by SOX2 expression, versus their more differentiated
counterparts, to map the cell state-specific regulatory logic of this pathway (Aim 2). Unraveling the context-
dependence of this extremely important and versatile signaling cascade has the potential to transform our
thinking about chronic inflammation in cancer and to reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities in chromosomally unsta-
ble cancer cells that are otherwise resistant to cGAS-STING signaling."
10756078,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lung failure from endotoxemia and sepsis induces widespread and often rapid lung vascular endothelial injury due
to unfettered influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This maladaptive inflammatory
response outpaces the reparative capacity of lungs, resulting in profound inflammatory lung injury and hypoxemia.
This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory
activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such
as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release
of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory
response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI). In Aim
1, we will determine the mechanisms by which the recently identified perforin Gasdermin D mediates
endothelial plasma membrane pore formation and the mechanisms of activation of the K+ efflux ion channel
TWIK2 that we have recently identified. We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and
rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define
another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated
mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically
amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling. These mechanistically driven studies will utilize
genetic mouse models (endothelial specific knockout models in our labs) as well as comprehensive imaging,
electrophysiological and physiological approaches and thus provide the framework for identifying novel endothelial
amplification inflammatory mechanisms that induce lung vascular injury and ALI. We will elucidate how these
pathways can be targeted to reduce tissue damage and improve survival."
10762945,"ABSTRACT
Atherosclerosis and restenosis are chronic and acute inflammatory vascular diseases, respectively,
characterized by significant vascular remodeling. Phenotypic switching of resident vascular smooth muscle cells
(SMCs) plays a unique and critical role in remodeling and is a key event promoting disease progression. While
the concept of SMC phenotypic modulation, marked by a shift from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a
dedifferentiated, pro-inflammatory phenotype, is well-accepted, the mechanisms regulating these SMC
transitions are complex. Importantly, there are no therapeutics that prevent both the loss of the SMC contractile
phenotype and increased inflammation. We previously established that PTEN is critical in the regulation of
pathological vascular remodeling. PTEN inactivation promotes a dedifferentiated, inflammatory SMC phenotype.
More recently, we defined an entirely unique and essential function for nuclear PTEN as a transcriptional co-
factor with SRF, a master transcription factor regulating SMC contractile gene and SMC-specific miR-143/145
expression, and its muscle-specific cofactor, myocardin. PTEN loss prevents SRF-myocardin transcriptional
activity. Translationally significant, this activity was confirmed in normal and diseased human coronary arteries
as we established that PTEN loss directly correlated with SMC dedifferentiation and atherosclerosis progression
and complexity. The mechanism mediating loss of PTEN in this setting was unclear. We recently demonstrated
that systemic PTEN elevation blunts angiotensin II (AngII)-mediated vascular remodeling and fibrosis and blocks
atherosclerotic lesion progression and injury-mediated neointima formation; these effects are associated with
preservation of a contractile SMC phenotype and a reduced inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, our data
support that PTEN is an essential driver of the differentiated SMC phenotype through direct transcriptional control
of SMC contractile genes and repression of a proinflammatory phenotype and indicate that systemic PTEN
upregulation is sufficient to prevent vascular disease progression. A recent unbiased high throughput screen
designed to discover novel small molecule activators of PTEN revealed that the DNA methyltransferase 1
(DNMT1) inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-aza), robustly upregulates PTEN at the level of transcription, reverses
PDGF-mediated SMC dedifferentiation and repression of the DNA methylcytosine deoxygenase, TET2, and
blocks pathological vascular remodeling. Importantly, these effects both in vitro and in vivo are mediated via
PTEN. We propose that hypermethylation of the PTEN gene is an essential mechanism that reduces PTEN
levels and promotes pathological vascular remodeling (Aim One). In addition, we propose that the vascular
protective effects mediated by 5-aza are driven through increased PTEN expression, crosstalk between PTEN
and TET2, and downstream regulation of miR-143/145 (Aim Two). Finally, we propose that increased PTEN
promoter hypermethylation correlates with increased atherosclerosis progression, upregulation of DNMT1, and
downregulation of TET2 in diseased human vessels (Aim Three)."

Dr. Bond’s primary career goal is to run her own independent academic research group broadly investigating
how principles of brain development can be used to understand and manipulate adult brain plasticity and

her career development. The proposed research and career development plan has been specifically designed
to fulfill Dr. Bond’s unmet training and prepare her for the next independent stage of her career. The plan includes
research training in new technical skills, including ex-vivo time-lapse imaging, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and
bioinformatic analysis of large-scale omics datasets, as well as career development training, including grant

The main objective of the proposed research is to understand the developmental process and molecular
mechanisms that promote dentate gyrus neural stem cell quiescence and maintenance beyond development. A
multipronged approach, including single-cell, candidate gene, and transcriptome-wide methods, will be used.
First, clonal lineage tracing and time-lapse imaging experiments in Aim 1 will determine the timing and cellular
behaviors that predict neural stem cell transition into quiescence during neonatal development. Then, genetic
deletion experiments in Aim 2 will investigate how β1-integrin signaling is required for proper establishment of
the quiescent neural stem cell pool during neonatal development, which could subsequently have long-term
effects on adult neurogenesis. Finally, in Aim 3, single-cell RNA-sequencing of neural stem cells across neonatal
development will reveal the molecular cascade that drives neural stem cell quiescence and maintenance during
neonatal dentate gyrus development. The proposed research is well-aligned with the National Institute of Mental
Health’s interest in basic research aimed at understanding the complex biological processes that direct
neurodevelopment. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of neural stem cell
maintenance and will have long-term applications for enhancing neural plasticity and neuroregeneration."
10871675,"Background. Nearly 90% of Veterans who complete trauma-focused therapy (TFT) for PTSD have remaining
treatment needs. In the six-months following TFT, successful completers remain some of the highest utilizers
of VA mental health services despite clinically meaningful symptom improvement. Our prior work demonstrated
that Veterans who benefitted from TFT's primary post-TFT treatment needs were the practice and application
of skills learned during therapy, with the goal of maintaining or building upon treatment gains. Veterans
expressed low self-efficacy for meeting these goals without the support of their therapists and feared
stagnation or relapse without ongoing contact. As such, we developed and feasibility-tested a therapist-
assisted self-management program for TFT completers (EMPOWER) designed as a step down from active
psychotherapy. The feasibility open trial demonstrated that EMPOWER is feasible and highly acceptable to
patients. Further, findings suggest that the intervention was successful in helping Veterans maintain or
enhance PTSD-related gains while reducing their mental health service utilization. These promising findings
warrant a randomized evaluation. Significance. Interventions that meet Veterans' post-TFT treatment needs
are urgently needed. Mental health providers are delivering ongoing treatment to this high priority cohort of
Veterans without evidence to guide their treatment plan. Further, higher than expected levels of post-TFT
mental health care utilization threatens the continued implementation of these highly effective treatments. For
all Veterans to have access to the most effective treatments for PTSD, we must evaluate and implement
interventions that prepare and enable successful TFT completers to step down from active therapy.
Innovation. The proposed study is the first large-scale study of post-TFT care and the first to rigorously
evaluate a self-management program to step-down from active to maintenance mental health services
following a course of active psychotherapy. More broadly, we believe it to be the first intervention to directly
facilitate an episodic model of mental health care. Specific Aims: 1) Estimate posterior probability distributions
of EMPOWER's effects and establish likely ranges for those effects as compared to post-TFT TAU for
Veterans' MH service utilization and self-reported PTSD symptoms. The subsequent Hybrid RCT will be
designed after assessing the likelihood of detecting an effect for EMPOWER across a range of sample sizes
using Go/No Go and Overall Power methods. 2) Explore the impact of EMPOWER compared to post-TFT TAU
on Veterans'(a) self-efficacy for managing PTSD symptoms, (b) satisfaction with post-TFT care, (c) well-being
& functioning (d) depression, and (e) secondary utilization outcomes. 3) Conduct semi-structured interviews
with Veterans and providers to contextualize quantitative findings and identify potential barriers, facilitators,
and strategies to facilitate future implementation of EMPOWER. Methodology: We are proposing a pragmatic
randomized control trial (RCT) in which 36 PE and CPT providers will be randomized to support Veterans as
they participate in the EMPOWER self-management program or facilitate TAU. Participants will be patients of
the study providers who recently completed a course of PE/CPT during which they experienced clinically
meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms (n=90). Primary outcomes will be mental health service utilization
(overall and with PE/CPT providers) and self-reported PTSD symptoms measured four times over a 9-month
period. Qualitative interviews with providers (n=18) and Veterans (n=24) focused on providers' impressions of
treatment effectiveness, implementation challenges/potential strategies, and Veterans' perception of treatment
effectiveness. Next Steps: With partners at the National Center for PTSD and the Office of Mental Health &
Suicide Prevention, we will determine whether a subsequent Hybrid Type I or II RCT is warranted."
10812986,"Because of the pressing needs to comprehensively understand the biological attributes of glycosylation in
many critical biological functions such as the immune response, cell development, cellular
differentiation/adhesion and host-pathogen interactions, glycoproteomics continues to be a highly dynamic
research area. Aberrant glycosylation for decades has been recognized as the attribute of many mammalian
diseases, including osteoarthritis, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. Moreover, isomeric alterations of glycoproteins
have been observed in diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and cancers. Recently, glycans and their isomers
have been reported to be vital to the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, making them a crucial target for the drug
development of COVID-19. Therefore, reliable, and efficient characterization of glycopeptides and their isomers
is necessary to better understand the attributes of glycosylation in biological and biomedical processes. We are
proposing here four specific aims: Aim 1. To enhance the separation and identification of glycopeptide isomers
using mesoporous graphitized carbon (MGC)-LC-MS and hydrophobicity index of peptides (HIP); Aim 2. To
enhance the quantification of glycopeptide isomers using a 15N metabolic-TMT multiplexing approach and a
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method; Aim 3. To enhance the glycopeptide isomeric characterization using
novel derivatization methods; and Aim 4. To enhance automated isomeric glycopeptide data processing by the
development of improved software. The outcome of these aims will provide reliable and efficient glycoproteomic
platforms and algorithms for a better isomeric characterization of glycopeptides which can be employed to
address biomedical issue, thus contributing to the glycoscience community. The innovations of this proposal
originate from the uniqueness of the proposed analytical methods and software. The isomeric separation of
glycopeptides using MGC-LC-MS/MS is a highly innovative method, developed in our lab, permitting efficient
separation of glycopeptide isomers on a 1 cm short column. The retention time normalization of glycans intra
and inter-laboratories has been introduced and demonstrated to be necessary previously through a glucose unit
index (GUI), but not in glycoproteomic analysis. For the first time, we will investigate the retention time
normalization of glycopeptides and glycopeptide isomers using a set of peptides which have known
hydrophobicity factors on different instruments and different laboratories. The combination of 15N stable isotope
labeling of glycopeptides and TMT will double the multiplexing capacity of TMT to 36-plex when studying in vitro
cell line glycoproteomics. Although PRM has been utilized for glycoproteomic profiling, the analysis of isomeric
glycoproteomics is lacking. Thus, this will be the first comprehensive investigation of glycopeptide isomers using
PRM. Moreover, the derivatization methods we proposed are of great innovation. It will be the first time to achieve
2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling on sialic acids of glycopeptides, and the first time to achieve efficient isomeric
separation of sialoglycopeptides on a 15 cm C18 column via a two-step oxidation-reductive amination reaction.
In addition, we have achieved a derivatization of sialylated glycopeptides (DOSG) method that will introduce
mass difference to distinguish α2,3 and α2,6 linked sialoglycopeptides. Consequently, the combination oxidation-
reductive amination and DOSG methods leads to an innovative enrichment method for sialoglycopeptides. The
derivatization of carboxyl groups of sialic acids on glycans and amino acids on peptide backbone neutralizes
additional charges and the addition of quaternary ammonium functionalized molecules provides controllable
positive charges which make the enrichment using strong cation exchange (SCX) possible. This is a novel
method for the efficient enrichment of sialoglycopeptides where sialic acid linkage isomers can be distinguished
at the same time. The deliverables of this proposal are reliable, adaptable, and affordable strategies and
improved software to enhance the isomeric glycopeptide studies by any laboratory interested in defining
comprehensive protein glycosylation using LC-MS/MS. The proposed technologies are expected to enable a
better understanding of the biological attributes of glycoprotein isomers in the development and progression of
diseases."

People in every socioeconomic class, both males and females, and every nationality and ethnicity are affected
by infertility. Aneuploidy is the leading cause of infertility, as well as birth defects, and miscarriages. Aneuploidy
occurs when there are errors in the specialized cell division of meiosis. Meiotic success is dependent on proper
segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I, and then subsequent sister chromatid segregation at
meiosis II. There is still much that is unknown about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to infertility, and
even less is known about the sexually dimorphic mechanisms during gametogenesis that can be contributing
factors. The overall goal of the lab is to determine how these sexually dimorphic molecular mechanisms
contribute to infertility. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the sex-specific roles of an enzyme crucial
for relieving topological abnormalities in DNA during male and female meiosis. This enzyme, Topoisomerase II
(Topo II), has been shown to have sex-specific phenotypes in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis in a
variety of model organisms. Topo II also has roles in chromosome structure, condensation, and is a
chromosome axis component in both mitosis and meiosis. Preliminary data indicates that Topo II also plays a
role in the release of sister chromatid cohesion, an important step in ensuring the success of meiosis. The
goals of this proposal will take a combined genetic, molecular biology, and biochemical approach to determine
the sex-specific role of Topo II in meiosis. To achieve this, the applicant will be advised by a mentoring team
that includes a sponsor with expertise in the fields of Meiosis and Genetics, as well as a co-sponsor who is an
expert in Biochemistry, including protein expression, purification, and function. The collaboration between the
candidate and her sponsors provides her with mentorship that is unique, interdisciplinary, and allows for the
opportunity to develop a skillset that will be utilized throughout the entirety of her academic career, from post-
doc to independent researcher. The resources, facilities, equipment, and faculty, available at the University of
Delaware far exceed the needs of the proposal, ensuring a successful training environment to complete the
aims proposed. Aim 1 uses single chromosome fluorescence labeling and nano-resolution microscopy to
characterize the sexually dimorphic role of TOP-2 on sperm chromosome structure in late meiotic prophase l. I
will also use a combination of genetic and confocal microscopy to determine the role of TOP-2 on oocyte
chromosomes. Aim 2 will determine the differential protein interactions of TOP-2 in spermatogenesis and
oogenesis using a biochemical approach in vivo and in vitro. These aims are innovative in the field of meiosis
because the mechanisms known to govern the sex-specific differences in spermatogenesis and oogenesis are
still largely unknown, exploring the role of Topo II will give us insight into one of the many functional and
regulatory differences between male and female gametogenesis."

Developmental dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by word reading difficulties that impacts 5-
12% of children in the US. Dyslexia is most commonly associated with impaired sensitivity to language sounds
(phonological awareness). However the ultimate goal of reading is not to access sound, but to access meaning.
Although the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying sound processing and its impairments in dyslexia are
relatively well understood, little is known about the role and neurocognitive basis of sensitivity to units of
meaning (morphological awareness) in dyslexia. This is a major gap in knowledge, as children with dyslexia
typically demonstrate poor morphological awareness, and decoding polymorphemic words becomes increasingly
important for academic success through elementary and middle school. Guided by the Lexical Quality framework
and Connectionist theories of reading, the current proposal will investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms
underlying morphological processing in relation to word reading children with dyslexia (4th-5th grade) as well as
age-matched (4th-5th grade) and skill-matched (2nd-3rd grade) typical readers. I will collect structural and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data during a novel morphological processing task. Participants will also
complete a comprehensive assessment of oral language, reading, and cognitive skills. First I will characterize
the neurocognitive basis of morphological processing and its development in typical readers. I will then test the
hypothesis that the neurocognitive basis of morphological processing differs between typically developing
children and those with dyslexia. Finally, I will identify the neural correlates of morphological processing that are
associated with behavioral measures of word reading (dis)ability, advancing our understanding of dyslexia by
connecting brain to behavior. This work is of theoretical and practical importance, as morphology becomes
increasingly important for successful reading over time, yet neurocognitive models of reading and dyslexia rarely
include morphological processes. Additionally, morphology may be one powerful way to compensate for
phonological deficits in dyslexia. Findings may inform educational and clinical practices to capitalize on
morphological processing as a promising compensatory mechanism, and provide research-based intervention
for struggling readers. The proposed study will provide ample opportunities to complete the fellowship training
goals by advancing the trainee’s: 1) conceptual knowledge of dyslexia, 2) technical training in fMRI
neuroimaging, 3) advanced methodological knowledge, and 4) translational skills in working with educators and
clinicians. This work will be conducted at MIT and MGH IHP, both vibrant academic communities with extensive
resources for pediatric neuroimaging, and supervised by leading experts in the field with decades of experience
conducting research related to reading and dyslexia."
10740892,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Gaze stabilization during head motion is a complex behavioral response that is highly dependent
upon a functioning vestibular system. With vestibular loss, patients suffer gaze deficits that make it
difficult to read, drive, or visually focus while moving throughout life. Remarkably, birds demonstrate
complete spontaneous vestibular receptor regeneration following damage, unlike humans. In these
animals, following regeneration, vestibular mediated gaze responses largely recover. However, the
specific eye and head component responses that comprise gaze differ significantly following regeneration,
suggesting that brain plasticity has re-wired the neural correlates that control gaze. In an effort to
understand regenerative brain plasticity, the proposed project will examine the functional recovery of
specific vestibular neural types that underly gaze control in pigeons. In Specific Aim 1, neural recordings
of vestibular afferent responses to motion will be obtained before a vestibular lesion and at four distinct
time points during regeneration of the receptors. As motion signals are regenerated from the receptors,
we will characterize the signals being restored and at what times. Specific Aim 2 will examine the central
vestibular neurons that specifically control the eye and head components of gaze behavior before, during,
and after regeneration. Vestibular neurons that project to spinal cord or oculomotor centers will be
characterized as motion signals are returning and the brain reorganizes gaze control circuits.
Regeneration, gene therapy, and prosthetics are all developing into new technologies that will be used to
treat vestibular loss in humans. Understanding how the brain adapts to these new motion signals will
provide necessary insights to guide new treatment therapies and rehabilitation paradigms."

Essential Tremor (ET), despite being the most common movement disorder affecting 4% of adults over age 40,
remains relatively understudied in terms of its pathogenesis, neurophysiology, clinical classification, and
optimization of treatments on a patient-specific basis. For the 25-55% of medication-refractory patients whose
symptoms have become functionally limiting, surgical management is recommended, most commonly with deep
brain stimulation (DBS). However, despite recent advances in DBS lead technology, controversy exists over the
optimal target, side effects occur frequently, and up to 73% of patients experience loss of benefit over time. As
a result, there is a clear need for refinement and deepened understanding of optimizing treatments for ET. This
project will leverage an ongoing prospective clinical study in human patients diagnosed with ET and
implanted with directional DBS leads, integrating high-field magnetic resonance imaging, patient-
specific pathway activation modeling of DBS, quantitative sensors, and comprehensive
electromyography measurements to further understand the neural and muscular mechanisms behind
tremor control and progression. Specifically, Aim 1 will identify the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways
involved in kinetic and postural tremor control with directional DBS leads, pathway activation optimization
algorithms, and quantitative sensors. Aim 2 will approach identifying the underlying mechanisms of tremor control
from the peripheral muscular end using whole-body electromyography. Finally, Aim 3 will determine how
tolerance to stimulation, disease progression, or lead placement contribute to long-term DBS failure in tremor
control. While DBS can result in improvement of clinical tremor scores, physicians still have trouble capturing
action tremor in the short-term and maintaining therapeutic benefit in the long-term. Understanding the pathways
contributing to tremor and to side effects via a model-based, patient-specific programming approach would allow
for improved and more consistent control of patients’ symptoms with DBS therapy."
10752710,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in
real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor
viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific
metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR
reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early
developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low
sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the
difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes.
We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich
protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI.
However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity
and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that
the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from
endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background
CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of
the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between
exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease
pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity.
We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that
will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic
virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with
improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally
throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes
we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence
based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST
reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid
quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods
will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models."
10759426,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a teratogenic human pathogen that causes congenital eye and brain
diseases. Affected babies exhibit vision impairment and associated ocular pathology, including loss of foveal
reflex and macular pigment mottling, chorioretinal scarring, and macular atrophy. ZIKV has become endemic
and local transmissions in the USA have been reported previously. The long-term effects of structural damage
on vision, as well as the pathogenic processes of congenital ZIKV eye diseases are beginning to be understood.
The signaling pathways governing normal eye development, which are dysregulated during ZIKV infection, are
not well characterized. We recently carried out a series of experiments by establishing a ZIKV infectious ocular
cell culture system and mouse models to understand the structural and molecular perturbations. For successful
replication, viruses have evolved various strategies to evade innate immune response as well as to enhance the
availability of cellular metabolites required to meet the heightened energy demand for viral genome synthesis.
We found that the AMPKα, a cellular master energy sensor, is activated in the ZIKV-infected retinal cells.
Moreover, pharmacological activation of AMPK resulted in attenuated ZIKV replication. Another interesting
finding is that the YAP/TAZ factors in the tumor suppressor Hippo/SWH signaling pathway were induced early
on, but degraded at later stage of ZIKV infection in RPE cells. Silencing YAP/TAZ resulted in reduced ZIKV
replication. Since the energy sensor AMPK and Hippo signaling pathways control key cellular processes,
including host antiviral responses, it is critical to understand the fundamental mechanism of these two pathways
deregulation. We hypothesize that ZIKV modulates AMPK and Hippo signaling pathways in ocular cells to 1)
increase intracellular metabolic resources, and 2) inhibit TBK1 to antagonize antiviral defense. These molecular
changes can be orchestrated through viral coded factors resulting in the pathogenesis of ocular cell injury. The
following specific aims will be investigated. Aim 1 focuses on systematically evaluating the role of AMPK-
Hippo signaling on regulating antiviral response to ZIKV infection in RPE cells. The cross talk between
these pathways will be investigated at the YAP/TAZ level. Pharmacological activation/inhibition, and gene
knockout approaches in RPE cells will be carried out. Aim 2 is designed to elucidate the effect of ZIKV on
Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways during retinal development. Human iPSC-derived 3D-retinal cup
organoids will be used to investigate the link between retinal development and ZIKV-mediated deregulation of
these key pathways. The ZIKV-encoded virulence factors regulating these pathways will be characterized. Aim
3 is to determine the effect of RPE-specific ablation of AMPK, TBK1, and Hippo signaling on the
pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced chorioretinal atrophy in mice. This proposed study would yield novel insights
into the pathogenesis of ZIKV in ocular diseases and identification of potential therapeutic targets."

 Innovative developments in single-cell sequencing technologies and techniques are providing
increased resolution and novel ways to define and characterize cellular profiles. Despite this progress, linking
different aspects of a cell’s identity, such as transcriptome, spatial location, morphology, and physiological
response remains challenging. Spatial transcriptomic technologies, while providing transcriptomic data within a
spatial framework, frequently must compromise achieving single-cell resolution in order to survey a wider panel
of genes. Similarly, while techniques such as fluorescent micro-optical section tomography (fMOST) and
functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) provide detailed reconstructions of neuron morphology and physiological
response, these data modalities lack the ability to simultaneously capture molecular information. As a result,
while technological advances for each distinct modality continue to resolve finer and more complex cell type
distinctions, cohesive cellular profiles that combine all aspects of a cell’s identity, from transcriptome to
physiological response, have yet to be captured. Thus, understanding how the transcriptomic and
morphological composition of a cell influences its physiological response is a key barrier for the field.
 This proposal aims to develop computational tools that will connect multiple facets of cellular identity. In
Aim 1, we propose the addition of graph-regularization into the integrative non-negative matrix factorization
algorithm (GRINMF). The use of GRINMF to include spatial information will result in more refined cell-type
characterizations for cells assayed with spatial transcriptomics technologies. In Aim 2, we will validate a spatial
deconvolution algorithm that leverages non-negative matrix factorization to calculate cell-type proportions
within spatially registered transcriptomic data. We will anchor our derived cell-type proportion voxels in the
same coordinate framework as a series of morphological and physiological datasets. By completing the
proposed research, I will gain extensive experience in the development of algorithms to synthesize
physiological, transcriptomic, and spatial data. This training will facilitate advancement of my communication,
critical thinking, and translational technical skills, providing me with the tools necessary to pursue my ambition
of becoming a research scientist at the interface of neuroscience and bioinformatics."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes more than 600,000 deaths worldwide and 12,000 deaths in United
States per year. The overall survival of patients with HCC is less than 18% and most patients with HCC have
limited treatment options. There is an urgent need to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies
and agents to treat HCC. Over the years we have identified focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a promising target
to treat HCC. We found that FAK is amplified and overexpressed in 16% of HCC specimens. We found that
deletion of Fak in hepatocytes suppressed c-Met (MET)/β-catenin (CAT)-induced HCC tumor growth and
prolonged survival of animals. We demonstrated that FAK kinase activity is critical for HCC development and
FAK kinase inhibitors effectively suppressed HCC tumor growth. We further discovered that overexpression of
both FAK and CAT, but neither FAK nor CAT alone, in mouse livers was sufficient to lead to HCC formation
through an increased expression of AR. Despite all these exciting findings, more studies are warranted in
better understanding the molecular mechanisms by which FAK functions in liver cancers. The Overall
Objective of this grant is to answer three questions: 1, how does FAK promote HCC growth? 2, can we target
FAK to improve the efficacy of current target therapies? 3, as HCC cells acquire resistance to FAK inhibitors
treatment, how can we overcome this resistance? In the proposal, Aim1 will examine how FAK overexpression
promotes glycolysis. Aim 2 will investigate if targeting FAK will improve the efficacy of lenvatinib. Aim 3 will
dissect the mechanisms by which HCC cells acquire resistance to FAK inhibition. The results from this study
will provide an important mechanistic basis for therapeutic intervention to treat HCC by targeting FAK."

Surgical treatment of epilepsy and seizures involves recording seizure activity to identify the seizure onset zone
(SOZ), and resecting as much of the SOZ as possible. Existing approaches, such as electrocorticography
(ECoG), define epileptogenic cortex – brain tissue with the potential to initiate seizures – but are inaccurate as
40-60% of patients do not achieve durable seizure freedom after resection/ablation. This outcome gap has
spurred an interest in identifying novel neurophysiological biomarkers to identify brain regions for neurosurgical
intervention to maximize the benefit of epilepsy surgery. Just as the macroscale organization of the epileptic
brain is heterogenous with interconnected brain regions that contribute to seizure initiation and spread, the
microscale organization of epileptogenic cortex is also heterogenous, containing sub-millimeter regions that can
generate microscale inter-ictal activity between seizures. Microscale events may contribute to the generation of
clinical seizures observed at standard macroscales but have not been investigated as they are not detectable in
standard clinical ECoG recordings. Studying microscale events requires microscale µECoG recordings. Under
other support, we have developed a novel electrode array that provides high-density microcontact recording of
microscale events over large cortical areas, 1 cm2. The electrode records cortical surface potentials beyond the
resolution and coverage of any currently clinically-available technology.
For this R21 proposal, we propose to initiate a collaboration between a clinician and a neuroscientist-engineer
to develop and test the multiscale properties of seizure networks. We propose to investigate the mechanistic and
clinical implications of microscale epileptiform activity. We will focus on two predictions of the microscale model.
Aim 1 tests the mechanistic prediction that inter-ictal µ-seizures share similar cellular mechanisms as ictal
seizure events. Aim 2 tests the clinical significance of microscale recordings by examining the relationship of µ-
seizures recording intra-operatively to cortex vulnerable to seizure initiation and early propagation identified in
standard clinical recordings. Preliminary intraoperative studies in patients undergoing diagnostic monitoring
demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. This R21 proposal will therefore identify the specific potential value,
mechanistic and/or clinical, of studying microscale interictal events. The results will advance systematic
investigations of the microscale electrophysiology of epileptogenic tissue more broadly."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form lymphoma and is conventionally
treated with a combination of chemotherapeutics with the anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab. Although more
than half of patients can be cured with this approach, the remainder have a dire prognosis with a short
survival. Despite the variability in patient outcome, there are currently no routinely utilized molecular
biomarkers that can be employed for risk stratification or to direct a specific therapy. That is, precision
medicine does not currently exist for DLBCL.
We have identified a genetic alteration on the q-arm of chromosome 18 (18q) that is associated with an
aggressive subtype of DLBCL, and defined the TCF4 and BCL2 genes as critical targets at this locus.
The BCL2 gene encodes an important oncogene that prevents cell death, and can be targeted with the
inhibitor Venetoclax. The TCF4 gene encodes a transcription factor protein that we have found to drive
key malignant properties of lymphoma, such as promoting the expression of the MYC oncogene and the
B-cell receptor. In addition, we have defined a way to eliminate TCF4 expression using a novel type of
protein-degrader molecules that are directed towards BET proteins. This therefore provides an exciting
rational therapeutic avenue for targeting TCF4. We hypothesize that combining this with an inhibitor of
BCL2 will target both genes that are activated by 18q alterations, and provide a precision medicine
approach for treating this aggressive subset of DLBCL.
Here, we are proposing to investigate the function of 18q alterations in DLBCL and validate the
mechanism by which we believe this genetic event leads to lymphoma. We will also perform pre-clinical
investigation of combinations of BET and BCL2 inhibitors for the specific therapeutic targeting of 18q
alterations. Together, this work will advance our understanding of DLBCL disease biology and may lead
to advances in precision medicine for this disease."
10764916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heritable neurodegenerative disorder in which patients suffer from
progressive weakness, spasticity of lower limbs and gait deficiencies. The disease mainly manifests as adult-
onset die-back degeneration of the corticospinal tracts (CSTs). SPAST, also called SPG4, encodes spastin,
which is an enzyme that severs microtubules. By far, SPAST is the most common gene mutated in HSP. To
date, haploinsufficiency resulting from reduced functional spastin levels has been the prevalent mechanistic
explanation for HSP-SPG4. However, haploinsufficiency fails to explain why there are no developmental
abnormalities in HSP patients and why axonal degeneration is mostly confined to the CSTs. In addition, SPG4
knockout (KO) mice display only very mild motor deficits, with no reports of CST die-back. A new mouse model
in the laboratory of the PI has been designed specifically to test gain-of-function toxicity of mutant spastin proteins
as the cause of CST die-back and HSP-like motor deficits. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
toxic properties of mutant spastin proteins are the cause of HSP-SPG4, whereas reduced functional spastin
levels do not cause HSP but render axons more vulnerable to the disease-specific hit. Mechanistic hypotheses
will be investigated via transgenic mouse models (including a new mouse established in the PI’s laboratory, the
SPAST knockout mouse, and the mouse that is generated by crossing the two), as well as forebrain
glutamatergic neuronal cultures derived from isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)
lines. Catwalk gait analyses and CST anatomical assessments on the mice will be conducted to compare and
contrast the phenotypes resulting from toxicity of mutant spastins with those resulting from reduced functional
spastin levels. The hypothesis will be tested that crossing the two mouse lines will result in a more extreme HSP-
like phenotype than displayed by either of the parent lines. Dose dependent cytotoxicity of accumulated mutated
spastin proteins, a key prediction of a gain-of-function mechanism for the disease, will be evaluated. Decreased
microtubule acetylation observed in the afflicted axons is posited to result from higher histone deacetylase 6
(HDAC6) activity elicited by mutant spastins and is posited to be the main cause of the die-back degeneration of
CSTs. Potential mechanistic explanations for the greater HDAC6 activity will be explored. Reduced microtubule
mobility resulting from reduced microtubule severing (due to less functional spastin) is posited to be the main
cause of the greater vulnerability of the axon to the mutant spastins. Contemporary molecular biological, live-cell
imaging, anatomical and behavioral approaches will be used to test these hypotheses. Successful resolution of
these issues will lead to better prospects for treating patients with HSP-SPG4, and also provide insights into
microtubule-based mechanisms that may be common across HSPs caused by mutations of other genes."

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), caused by a variety of triggers including COVID-19, is a
devastating critical illness without effective therapies. Despite numerous studies on COVID-19 related ARDS
(CARDS), the best available treatments lead to only modest or inconsistent clinical improvements. This paucity
of discoveries is likely in part due to heterogeneity of host response to COVID-19. The long-term goal is to bring
precision therapies to patients with ARDS and CARDS. Using plasma protein biomarkers and clinical data, Dr.
Calfee (sponsor of the applicant) has identified two biologic subphenotypes of non-COVID-19 related or “typical”
ARDS. Specifically, patients with the hyperinflammatory subphenotype had higher levels of inflammatory
biomarkers, metabolic acidosis, and shock. They also experienced significantly higher mortality and were more
likely to benefit from certain ICU therapies. Conversely, most CARDS patients demonstrate a hypoinflammatory
subphenotype of typical ARDS, raising questions about the pathophysiology underlying poor outcomes in this
population. The overall objective of this project is to (i) identify plasma biomarkers and differential gene
expression associated with poor outcomes in CARDS and (ii) search for the presence of CARDS specific
subphenotypes of clinical importance. The central hypothesis is that differential gene expression indicative of
dysregulated inflammation and high baseline plasma biomarkers of lung injury and disordered coagulation will
predict poor outcomes in CARDS, and that distinct CARDS subphenotypes exist associated with differential
outcomes and treatment responses. The rationale for this project is that it will offer mechanistic insights into the
biology underlying poor outcomes in this population, lead to identifying potential druggable targets, and identify
patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapies. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing these
specific aims: 1) Identify biological predictors of poor clinical outcomes within patients with CARDS; and 2)
Identify distinct biologic subphenotypes of CARDS associated with poor clinical outcomes and differential
treatment response. Under aim 1, hypothesis-driven plasma protein biomarkers will be measured, and RNA
sequencing performed on blood samples of CARDS patients enrolled in ISPY COVID, an ongoing adaptive
randomized controlled trial of experimental drugs across multiple US institutions. Under aim 2, latent class
analysis will be performed on a combination of protein biomarkers and clinical variables to identify
subphenotypes associated with distinct outcomes and responses to the trial’s investigational agents. The
proposed research is innovative, because extensive biological phenotyping in a large and representative cohort
of patients with a uniform trigger for ARDS has not been done and may be the key to identifying successful
therapies. Ultimately, this knowledge will pave the way for conducting phenotype-aware trials studying targeted
therapies in patients with subphenotypes of CARDS."

synthetic population template of normative samples (Figure1) and will be used to assess the ‘normal’
phenotypic variation in mouse development at E15.5 (Aim 1). The template will be segmented to the finest
anatomical detail possible and will contain more anatomical structure and detail than the existing KOMP2 fetal
atlas. Each sci-RNA-seq line will be assesses for overall phenotypic variability (Figure 3) and then be
subjected to region-specific statistical (Figure 4) analysis of tissue volume and shape differences (Aim 2). We
will also train a deep-learning model to achieve automated segmentation of fetal mice and compare the results
to the current-state-of-the-art, template-based analysis (Aim 3).
Our goal is to leverage recent advances in the 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the
3D morphological characterization of mouse mutants to be more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and
accessible. Combining molecular phenotype and anatomical phenotypes will provide a comprehensive
characterization of mice with mutations relevant to human structural birth defects."

Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine. This proposal represents a true collaborative effort between the NCCU
and UNC faculty with both groups contributing significant effort and being essential to the success of this
Alcohol and Health Disparities program. Within this proposal, an NCCU Administrative Core and three
Research Components will integrate with the UNC-BCAS Administrative Research Components, as well as
other activities at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. The UNC NIAAA Alcohol Research Center (ARC) and
BCAS have many faculty studying mechanisms of alcohol pathology across the spectrum of behavioral, tissue,
and cellular pathologies that occur with alcohol exposure. This proposal will focus on cellular pathologies that
allow collaborative research partnerships on common areas of interest between UNC and NCCU faculty.
These partnerships open UNC research laboratories, core facilities, and medical libraries to NCCU faculty,
improving opportunities for developing productive research laboratories at NCCU. In addition, due to recent
NCCU NIAAA R awards, large numbers of NCCU students will continue to become involved in research on
mechanisms of alcohol pathology, providing education on African American alcohol-related health disparities
which are due to increased morbidity to alcohol-related pathologies and not increased alcohol use disorder.
The objective of this U54 partnership is to investigate molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced cellular
pathology. This proposal includes three NCCU research projects, involving six NCCU faculty, that will
investigate the molecular mechanisms of fetal alcohol pathology, alcohol-induced mammary stem cell toxicity,
and neuroimmune responses in adolescent and adult brain. A second objective is to provide research
experiences and scholarly education on alcohol pathology for NCCU students. The educational efforts in this
proposal will involve NCCU undergraduate and graduate students through the BCAS seminar series, through
training in UNC laboratories and research development and mentor meetings, attendance and presentation of
data at the annual RSA meeting, an alcohol seminar series hosted by NCCU, new course curricula on alcohol
pathology developed with a focus on health disparities, as well as specific undergraduate student summer
internships for NCCU students to study and learn about alcohol pathology and health disparities within
laboratories in both institutions. Ultimately, this proposal will conduct, promote, support, and mentor research
into mechanisms of alcohol pathology, creating an active and successful alcohol research program within
NCCU that synergizes with UNC to advance education and discoveries."
10812312,"Our overarching hypothesis is that senescent stromal fibroblasts, especially if they elicit an inflammatory
response, promote progression to lethal disease in men with prostate cancer. Senescent stromal fibroblasts
may result from telomere attrition, but also other aging and non-aging mechanisms, and can elicit inflammation
that acts in cancer initiation and promotion to a lethal state. Our preliminary findings implicate prostate stromal
cell telomere shortening and intraprostatic inflammation, both are intimately linked to the biology of cellular
senescence, in prostate cancer. Thus, we expect that specifically senescent fibroblasts, which have been
shown to secrete cytokines and other growth promoting factors, will be present in prostate-cancer associated
stroma and be related to lethal disease in men with prostate cancer. To address our hypothesis, we developed
and documented a multi-marker tissue-based strategy to uniquely identify fibroblasts, one of two major cell
types in the prostate stroma, the subset of fibroblasts that are senescent, and the associated immune infiltrate.
We propose these aims: 1. Evaluate the association between senescent stromal fibroblasts, especially in the
presence of stromal inflammation, in prostatectomy tissue and risk of progression to metastatic prostate cancer
in men with intermediate and high-risk disease (Cohort 1). 2. Evaluate the association between senescent
stromal fibroblasts, especially in the presence of stromal inflammation, and risk of progression to metastasis or
rapidly rising PSA in a second, independent cohort of men with intermediate and high-risk disease (Cohort 2).
3. Determine whether senescent fibroblasts are present in prostate metastases, and if so, their heterogeneity
across metastatic sites in bone and in soft tissues, in men who died of castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We
will identify senescent stromal fibroblasts in fixed prostate tissues using multiplex in situ immunofluorescence
staining with quantification via image analysis. In Aims 1 and 2, we will calculate the density of specific
senescent stomal fibroblasts per stromal area, the proportion with associated inflammation, and estimate
adjusted relative risks of lethal disease progression. Given that Black men have substantially higher prostate
cancer mortality rates, we will estimate associations separately in Black men. If our hypothesis is confirmed,
we will determine prognostic performance of senescent stromal fibroblasts, and assess whether their addition
enhances performance of existing cancer cell-based genomic prognostic tests already measured in Cohorts 1
and 2. Goal 1 is to inform the pressing clinical need for identifying which men’s, including Black men’s prostate
cancers are very likely to kill and, equally important, which ones are very unlikely to kill. If our hypothesis is
confirmed, data from our work could be incorporated into a prognostic tool. Goal 2 is to inform novel
therapeutics (senolytics) that eliminate senescent stromal fibroblasts in men at risk for progression or harboring
metastases. A prognostic tool incorporating senescent stromal fibroblasts could also serve as a companion
diagnostic, in that it would identify men with these senescent cells for targeting."
