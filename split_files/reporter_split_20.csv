10906180,"Constipation is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorders in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),
due in part to their multiple comorbidities, concomitant medications, low fiber and fluid intake, and altered gut
microbiota. Although constipation is usually perceived as a benign condition, recent evidence has challenged
this most common perception, demonstrating its independent association with poor clinical outcomes, partly
through the altered gut microbiota favoring the production of fecal metabolites. Among patients with CKD whose
gut plays an important role in the disposal of uremic toxins and in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, the presence
of constipation can preclude these compensatory mechanisms and may further contribute to their poor clinical
outcomes. Importantly, recent experimental studies in uremic animals have shown that constipation treatment
with laxatives not only accelerated intestinal motility but also modified the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites,
protected the gut barrier, suppressed inflammatory responses, and even ameliorated CKD progression. These
findings led to the suggestion that the adequate management of constipation in patients with CKD may provide
additional therapeutic and prognostic benefits beyond its conventional defecation control. However, no human
studies have yet examined the effects of constipation treatment on clinical outcomes associated with constipation,
or on outcome-related biochemical and microbiological parameters in patients with CKD. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that treatment of constipation in patients with CKD not only improves their constipation
symptoms but also favorably modifies the relevant biochemical and gut microbial profiles, and ultimately
improves clinical outcomes in these patients. As a first step to test this hypothesis, we propose to perform a
single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, pilot feasibility trial of a 4-week intervention of
constipation treatment (vs. control) in patients with CKD and constipation, with the following specific aims: 1)
Test the feasibility of delivering the proposed interventions and performing the proposed examinations; and 2)
Determine the effects of constipation treatment on the changes in constipation-related clinical symptoms,
biochemical parameters, and microbial profiles of the gut and circulating microbiota, in a total of 40 patients with
CKD stages G3-G5 and constipation, randomized 1:1 to constipation treatment (with lactulose) vs. control (with
no treatment except bisacodyl rescue therapy). Consistent with the objectives of the small R01 mechanism, this
small, short-term pilot feasibility trial allows us to acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of constipation
treatment on various aspects of patients with CKD and feasibility data related to recruitment, retention, and study
conduct. Furthermore, the findings of this study will lay the foundation for our long-term goal to test the
effectiveness of constipation treatment on several clinical outcomes associated with constipation in CKD in a
large-scale clinical trial, along with the determination of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, potentially
leading to the development of novel gut-targeted therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes in CKD."
10821336,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the primary cause of trauma-related death, and approximately
half of hemorrhage deaths occur before the patient reaches the hospital. Current techniques for
hemorrhage control are insufficient for a large number of wounds and do not adequately address
non-compressible hemorrhages. Thus, there is a critical need for improved hemostatic dressing
materials that are inexpensive, easy to apply, effective, and safe to use over prolonged time
frames. In the absence of such treatment options, tragic deaths from uncontrolled bleeding will
continue.
 The long-term goal of the proposed work is to provide an accessible option for hemorrhage
control that can be used with minimal training in remote situations. The overall objectives in this
application are to characterize efficacy of a promising biomaterial platform, shape memory
polymer (SMP) foams, in clinically-relevant hemorrhage models and to develop easy-to-use
storage and delivery devices. In preliminary work in a porcine grade V liver injury, SMP foam
treatment provided faster hemostasis, reduced total blood loss, and improved survival relative to
treatment with clinical controls. The rationale for the proposed work is that future clinical
translation efforts will be enabled by an improved understanding of how foam properties affect
hemorrhage control and expanded pre-clinical characterization of this promising platform.
 To achieve these objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued:
 Specific Aim 1: Evaluate effects of SMP foam architectures on hemorrhage control in in vitro
wound models, and design storage and delivery devices for non-compressible torso wounds and
compressible extremity wounds.
 Specific Aim 2: Characterize SMP foam efficacy in vivo in a non-compressible grade V liver
injury.
 Specific Aim 3: Characterize SMP foam application, efficacy, removal, and safety in vivo in
a compressible femoral artery injury.
 At the completion of these studies, the expectation is to have clinically-relevant SMP foam-
based hemostatic device designs for use in compressible and non-compressible traumatic
wounds. The primary positive impact of these studies will be a hemostatic dressing that is easy-
to-use and effective in a range of hemorrhagic wound types."
10812398,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults that is universally fatal
despite multimodal treatment. Novel therapies are therefore critically needed. Immunotherapy, such as
checkpoint blockade, has thus far failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. GBM has high intrinsic resistance to
antitumor immunity due to, among other factors, low expression of MHC-I and lack of T-cell infiltration.
Strategies to promote immunogenicity of GBM to sensitize tumor to checkpoint therapy is needed. Protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase comprised of a catalytic (C), regulatory (B)
and scaffolding (A) subunit. We have previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of PP2Ac can enhance
the efficacy of anti-PD1 blockade in multiple preclinical models, including GBM. However, the mechanism(s) or
cell type(s) responsible for the enhanced antitumor immune response is not well understood. Recently, we found
that deficiency of PP2Ac, by genetic modification, in glioma cells resulted in enhanced interferon signaling, which
is essential to eliciting antitumor immune response. PP2A deficiency in glioma cells enhanced MHC-I expression,
tumor T-cell infiltration and sensitivity to checkpoint blockade in vivo. We also demonstrated that PP2Ac
deficiency led to enhanced production of cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is known to activate
cGAS-STING signaling, a potent simulator of interferon production. Moreover, from unbiased screening of all
known regulatory B subunits, we identified PPP2R2C, a specific B subunit of PP2A, to have a similar role as
PP2Ac in promoting MHC-I expression. In this project, we will first elucidate the effect of PP2Ac deficiency in
glioma cells on the immunological landscape of the tumor microenvironment and will identify the immune cell
types responsible for PP2Ac modulated antitumor immunity. We will then dissect the molecular mechanisms
that link PP2A deficiency to cGAS-STING activation and promotion of interferon signaling in the glioma
microenvironment. We will also identify the role of the specific regulatory B subunit, PPP2R2C, in modulating
dsDNA production and cGAS-STING signaling. Finally, we will investigate the ability of PP2Ac deficiency to
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy, a major component of current standard-of-care and a
known stimulator of cGAS-STING signaling. The immediate goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms of
PP2A modulated immunogenicity in GBM, with the long-term goal of developing precise PP2A targeting
strategies to increase effectiveness of immunotherapies for GBM. We believe this study fits the mission of NINDS
to seek fundamental knowledge of the nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of
neurological disease such as brain tumor."
10807108,"Project Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related
death by 2030, yet there are no accurate diagnostic tests for early diagnosis. Among pancreatic cystic lesions
(PCLs), branch duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the most common precursor
lesion for pancreatic cancer. Nearly 50% of all prevalent cysts are BD-IPMNs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-
guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of PCLs and cyst fluid analysis are standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic
modalities. Unfortunately, the current SOC is suboptimal (65-75% accuracy) for the detection and risk
stratification [high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma (HGD-Ca) vs. low-grade dysplasia (LGD)] of BD-IPMNs.
The goal of surgery in BD-IPMNs is to resect lesions with HGD-Ca. However, multiple surgical series over the
last 5 years have revealed that nearly half to two-thirds of resected BD-IPMNs had only LGD, often
representing overtreatment. In these instances, the morbidity (30%) and mortality (2%) from surgical resection
of PCLs are not justified. On the other hand, several series reports missed (mean 13%) invasive cancers in
BD-IPMNs during follow-up. There are currently no accurate tests for detecting HGD-Ca in BD-IPMNs. We
have utilized a novel diagnostic modality of EUS-guided needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE),
a technology that provides in vivo, real-time, optical biopsies of PCLs. In a landmark study, we demonstrated a
high accuracy (97%) for nCLE-guided diagnosis of precancerous (includes mucinous BD-IPMNs) PCLs. We
have derived nCLE features of HGD-Ca that can be qualitatively assessed and quantitatively analyzed in BD-
IPMNs. We also have designed a pilot CLE-based convolutional neural network (CNN)-artificial intelligence
(AI) algorithm to risk-stratify BD-IPMNs (HGD-Ca vs. LGD). We have also pioneered cyst fluid Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) analysis, augmenting the diagnosis and risk-stratification of BD-IPMNs. The primary
objective of the proposed study is to accurately risk-stratify (HGD-Ca vs. LGD) BD-IPMNs to detect early-stage
PDAC and avoid unjustified pancreatic surgery. Supported by preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that
EUS-nCLE (manual and CNN-AI algorithm) and a combination of EUS-nCLE with NGS and SOC variables will
accurately risk-stratify BD-IPMNs. Specific aims – (1) Evaluate the accuracy and interobserver agreement of
EUS-nCLE differentiation (HGD-Ca vs. LGD) of BD-IPMNs among independent observers. (2) Improve and
prospectively evaluate an accurate nCLE-based CNN-AI algorithm for presurgical risk stratification (HGD-Ca
vs. LGD) of BD-IPMNs. (3) Evaluate an integrative diagnostic approach including nCLE, NGS, and SOC to
improve the accuracy of risk stratification (HGD-Ca vs. LGD) of BD-IPMNs. Successful completion of this
project and application in clinical practice will provide a method for early detection of PDAC arising from PCLs,
guiding surgical decision-making to help avoid unwarranted resections or delayed treatment."
10813872,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex establishes and maintains di- and tri-methylation of the
histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) in the genome and regulates chromatin structure, transcription, cellular
stemness and differentiation. PRC2 is a context-dependent tumor suppressor whose core components (e.g.,
EZH2, EED, or SUZ12) are inactivated in various cancer types. Among these, high-grade malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma with no effective therapies, has a high
prevalence (≥80%) of biallelic inactivation of EED or SUZ12, leading to complete loss of the PRC2 function.
PRC2 loss in cancer results in aberrant transcriptional activation of developmentally silenced master regulators,
which leads to enhanced cellular plasticity and aberrant activation of multiple signaling pathways. We recently
uncovered that PRC2 loss in cancer leads to an immune-desert tumor microenvironment and resistance to
immune checkpoint blockade. Nevertheless, we observed that, in murine models of PRC2-loss MPNST and
mammary tumors, response to immunotherapy can be enhanced by infection with immunogenic virus, which
activates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) signaling responses. Moreover, we have identified and validated a
lethal interaction between PRC2 loss and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) knockdown in MPNST. In vitro and
in vivo treatment with a demethylating agent (decitabine) or selective DNMT1 inhibitors (GSK862, GSK032) led
to enhanced cytotoxicity and antitumor effects in PRC2-loss compared to PRC2 wild-type (wt) MPNST models.
Mechanistically, DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) treatment in the PRC2-loss context amplified the expression of
endogenous retrotransposons and subsequently led to activation of innate immune responses, which could be
explained by retrotransposons forming dsRNA and triggering cytotoxicity via PKR-dependent dsRNA sensing.
we hypothesize that PRC2 loss in cancer may create therapeutic opportunities for agents (e.g., DNMTi, synthetic
dsRNA, immunogenic viruses) that activate the dsRNA signaling pathways in tumor cells to induce cytotoxicity
and enhance immunogenicity. Here, we propose integrative multi-omics analysis (e.g., transcriptome,
epigenome, single-cell [sc]RNA-seq and scATAC-seq) and innovative approaches (e.g., novel immunogenic
viruses, a novel lineage-tracking system) to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies and their mechanisms of
activating dsRNA responses and anti-tumor effects in relevant PRC2-loss cancers, focusing on specific aims:
(1) dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie the selective sensitivity to DNMTi in different PRC2-loss
cancers; (2) evaluate exogenous dsRNAs as a strategy to induce cytotoxicity in PRC2-loss tumors; and (3)
evaluate novel therapeutic strategies of activating dsRNA-responses in relevant cancer models. These studies
will generate insights into exploiting dsRNA-sensing and activation of innate immune responses as therapeutic
strategies in PRC2-loss cancers and provide the pivotal preclinical data for biomarker-driven clinical trials."

Inflammatory immune responses dictate cardiac healing post-myocardial infarction (MI) and are temporally
regulated to initiate wound-healing and scar formation. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to
immediately after myocardial infarction (MI), circulating, splenic and cardiac inflammatory cells (monocytes,
macrophages, and T-lymphocytes) are augmented even at 8-weeks post-MI (chronic HF), and promote
pathological left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Moreover, we and others have shown that depletion of specific
cell types, including monocytes/macrophages or T-cells during chronic HF blunts LV remodeling and prevents
progressive decline in cardiac function, suggesting a critical role of immune cells in this disease. These
findings underscore the necessity for identifying specific molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to restrain
pathological immune activation for therapeutic immune-modulation.
Recent studies have shown that CD4+ T-cells are obligatory for efficient healing, neovascularization, and to
check excessive fibrosis during MI. However, global knockout mouse models (such as CD4-/-) fail to consider
spatio-temporal alterations that we see during progression from acute-MI to chronic HF. Indeed, our previous
studies showed that CD4+ T-cells undergo a phenotypic shift specifically during chronic HF, promote LV
remodeling in an antigen-dependent manner, and their depletion from 4 to 8 weeks post-MI blunts progressive
cardiac dysfunction. Nonetheless, the molecular signatures that mediate this transition from being protective
during MI to pathological during chronic HF are not known. Using RNA sequencing on cardiac CD4+ T-cells
flow-sorted from the failing hearts of male mice, we showed that, as opposed to MI, T-cells activated during HF
possess upregulated estrogen receptor (ER) α signaling. Since ERα effects are opposed by ERβ activation, we
identified a novel ERβ agonistic drug (OSU-ERb-012). Our preliminary data show that OSU-ERb-012 is highly
efficacious at inhibiting anti-CD3/CD28 (T-cell receptor) mediated T-cell proliferation and expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, ex-vivo and in-vivo. Moreover, at 10 mg/kg dose OSU-ERb-012 significantly blunted
LV remodeling and HF progression when administered from 4 to 8 weeks post-MI suggesting its therapeutic
efficacy. Thus, we hypothesize that OSU-ERb-012 selectively inhibits antigenically activated pathological CD4+
T-cells at clinically translatable doses, ameliorate LV remodeling and progressive cardiac dysfunction during
chronic HF, and that ERβ agonists could be used as selective immuno-modulatory drugs. We will test this
hypothesis by i) delineating dose-dependent effects of OSU-ERb-012 in ameliorating LV remodeling, ii) testing
whether the protective effects of OSU-ERb-012 are mediated through T-cell specific ERβ agonism, and iii)
identify effects of OSU-ERb-012 on cardiomyocyte function and cardiac physiology."
10799621,"The nasal mucosa (NM) has several critical physiologic functions, including as a chemosensory organ, as a filter and conditioning surface of inhaled air for the lower airways, and as a first line of defense against airborne infections. In mammals, the nasal passage is anatomically complex, with different sub-compartments with distinct morphological and cellular features that may exert specialized, but as yet poorly understood, functions. Owing to its constant exposure to ever-changing environments, the NM is arguably the most frequently infected tissue in mammals. Aside from being a preferred initial target for many fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens, some of which may subsequently spread to the lower airways, blood, brain or other cranial regions, the nasal cavity is also colonized by a specialized microbiome that can serve as a reservoir for opportunistic pathogens. Despite the NM's importance for human health, little is known about the mechanisms by which local immune responses are initiated and/or regulated. Arguably, the NM must possess specialized features to enable appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses against a broad variety of challenges. The NM is known to harbor a population of subepithelial extravascular immune cells, but their origin, composition, and role at steady-state and in pathologic conditions are poorly understood. To address this issue, a novel intravital microscopy (IVM) model was devised to track the dynamic behavior of leukocytes in the NM of living mice. Preliminary results indicate that murine steady-state NM harbors a prominent population of extravascular neutrophils (EVN) that are abundant in both conventional and germ-free mice, suggesting that their presence is not driven by microbial stimuli. Furthermore, nasal EVN can be subdivided into three phenotypically distinct subsets: one population (termed N1) is CD11bint Ly6Gint, while the other two subsets are both CD11bhi Ly6Ghi and distinguishable by the absence (N2) or presence (N3) of CD11c and SiglecF. The primary objective of this project is to define how these unusual EVN subsets arise, how they respond to infectious challenges and what role they play in health and disease. It is hypothesized that each nasal EVN subset has a distinct origin, accesses the NM by discrete mechanisms, and exerts specialized functions in tissue homeostasis and in host defense against microbial infections. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will explore the origin and migratory properties of steady-state nasal EVN subsets, whereas Aim 2 will define the function of each EVN subset in homeostasis and after intranasal pathogen challenge. Results from the proposed work may not only improve our understanding of the NM as a critical barrier tissue, but also shed new light on immunological mechanisms that may impact the efficacy of nasal vaccines and on pathologic conditions affecting the nasal cavity such as allergies and a host of respiratory infections."

Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) affects over 35 million people worldwide, and this number is expected to triple by
2050. As early as a century ago, Alois Alzheimer noted three significant neuropathological features in the brain
of AD patients: senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and lipid granule accumulation. While senile plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles are now widely accepted as hallmarks of AD pathology, and thus have been extensively
studied, the role of lipid accumulation in AD pathogenesis has been less studied. Lipidomics is a new omics
technique that can identify and accurately quantify hundreds to thousands of lipids in biospecimens in large-
scale population studies. Using this technology, many lipid species have been reported to be associated with
cognitive phenotypes and AD neuropathologies (e.g., amyloid-beta, tau tangles). However, several key
knowledge gaps exist in this field. First, previous studies have largely focused on blood, but the brain lipidomic
profile is likely different from that of blood. To date, little is known about the global lipid composition and
individual lipid species that trigger neuropathologies in human AD brains. Second, of the few existing lipidomic
studies in human AD brains, sample size was mostly small and results were inconsistent. Importantly, the
coverage of brain lipidome (i.e., collection of all lipid species in brain) in previous studies was low, and thus
many disease-related lipids have not been investigated. To date, a full spectrum of brain lipidome in relation to
AD pathology is lacking, especially in large-scale epidemiological studies. Finally, the potential causal role of
lipid regulation in brain aging and AD neuropathology remains largely unknown and unexplored. To address
these important questions, we leverage the large-collection of postmortem brain tissue samples, the deep
clinical and neuropathological phenotypes, and the rich brain omics data (e.g., genomics, epigenomics, and
transcriptomics) in two community-based longitudinal cohorts of aging and dementia – the Religious Orders
Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Specifically, we will conduct the first comprehensive
lipidomic profiling in 1,450 frozen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using the Metabolon’s Complex Lipid
Panel (CLP), a mass spectrometry based platform that can identify and accurately quantify the absolute
concentrations of up to 1,100 individual lipid species and 14 lipid classes in large-scale epidemiological
studies. Our goals here are to 1) generate the first comprehensive reference map of brain lipidome in relation
to Alzheimer’s dementia-phenotypes (Aim 1); 2) identify individual brain lipid species associated with AD
neuropathologies and cognitive phenotypes (Aims 1 and 2); and 3) elucidate the potential causal role of altered
brain lipid regulation in AD pathology (Aim 3). Such results will shed light on the mechanisms through which
lipid accumulation in the aging brain affects AD pathology, and provide evidence for targeting lipid metabolism
in developing novel therapeutics for AD prevention and treatment."

Early life interactions between the microbiome and its human host are responsible for an array of immune
functions and future health outcomes. It is essential to study this period during early life when the oral
microbiome changes from highly dynamic infant microbiota towards a more stable adult-like microbiota. The
oral microbiome plays an essential role in oral and systemic health. As such, the study of the oral microbiome
may serve as a harbinger for children’s health. Understanding the establishment and early development of the
oral microbiome, and its association with the early childhood caries (ECC), may provide innovative solutions for
personalized, predictive, and preventive pediatric dentistry. This Mentored Research Development Award K01
study seeks to understand the dynamic changes of the oral microbiome during the first three years of life
among children who were born along the United States (US)-Mexico border. These children experience a high
risk of dental caries and other oral diseases; therefore, providing a complex environment for the microbiome.
The study aims are: (1) to understand the establishment of newborn oral microbiome among Latinx/Hispanic
children living along the US-Mexico border by using salivary samples at prenatal (from mother), 4-, 9-, 12-, 24-,
36-months to characterize their oral microbiome establishment from birth to a full set of twenty primary teeth;
(2) to compare children’s oral microbiome composition between control and treatment groups (mothers
received therapeutic three-month regimen of chlorhexidine mouth rinse to reduce the bacteria that causes
tooth decay when their children were between the ages of four to six months) while both groups received oral
health counseling; and (3) to develop statistical expertise in modeling the changes of oral microbiota and their
association with ECC controlling for confounding factors. This proposed research will use three recently
developed Bayesian-based ML algorithms to model the temporal patterns of the oral microbiome and evaluate
their ability to predict ECC. The K01 will support Dr. Yan Wang to develop expertise in: (1) oral microbiome
development in early childhood, (2) statistical analysis for oral microbiome data, and (3) biomarker discoveries
using saliva samples. To achieve these training goals and research activities, Dr. Wang has assembled a
highly qualified mentorship team with substantial experience in mentoring early-career investigators and with
expertise in oral microbiome research among children. Dr. Wang’s primary mentors at UCLA, Dr. Grace
Aldrovandi (School of Medicine) and Dr. David Wong (School of Dentistry), are highly experienced NIH-funded
investigators. Co-mentor Dr. Francisco Ramos-Gomez (School of Dentistry) is a leading expert in pediatric oral
health, especially among Latinx/Hispanic children. The proposed research and training aims will build strong
research capacities and collaborations for Dr. Yan Wang. In addition, this work will advance Dr. Yan Wang’s
research career in analytical and translational oral microbiome research."

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1/MENIN) is a transcriptional regulator known to interact with
Lysine Methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A/MLL1) driving aggressive subsets of leukemia including MLL1
rearranged (MLL-r), NPM1 mutated and NUP98 rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as other
cancers including gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Early success has been reported in clinical trials using
small molecule MENIN inhibitors (MI) that disrupt the MLL1/MENIN interaction to treat AML causing MENIN
to emerge as an important drug target. As a result, efforts to understand MENIN function are paramount for
the continued success of targeting this protein. I, as a research fellow working under the mentorship of Drs.
Scott Armstrong and Eric Fischer, have recently characterized an exciting aspect of the mechanism driving
the therapeutic effect of MI treatments. We have observed that protein stability changes to MENIN and other
proteins is an essential feature of MI sensitivity. Our preliminary examination of this mechanism has
uncovered that the loss of a specific E3 ligase can mediate decreased MI sensitivities via MENIN protein
stabilization. These findings have inspired a new approach of targeting MENIN protein stability with the
simple idea that more MENIN protein decreases drug sensitivity while less MENIN protein inhibits MLL-r
transcriptional programs. The experiments outline in this proposal aim to characterize MENIN protein
stability in AML by studying how this specific E3 ligase regulates MENIN contributing to MI sensitivity and
investigate newly established rapid MENIN degradation systems as a proof-of-principle for improving both
MENIN targeted therapies as well as the means to study MENIN function. We have recently established a
novel set of tools to study MENIN protein function including (i) MLL-r leukemia cell lines with edited MEN1
loci inserting different protein tags enabling high throughput MENIN protein stability reporter systems and
dTAG based rapid MENIN degradation systems, (ii) specific CRISPR libraries targeting MENIN protein
function and (iii) early candidate small molecule MENIN proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC). This
proposal is also designed to provide additional training experiences in advanced methods of transcriptional
analysis, biochemical binding assays, small molecule PROTAC design and mass spectrometry-based co-
immunoprecipitation as well as mentoring in manuscript/grant writing and leadership skills. Anchored by the
guidance of two well-resourced and established mentors, an excellent scientific advisory committee
composed of experts in the fields of leukemia and chromatin biology and a highly dynamic research
environment at DCFI, funding for this proposal will enable me to transition to an independent investigator."
10896965,"Project Summary/Abstract
The heart has a distinct metabolism that supports the continuous pumping of blood. This includes maintaining
the pyruvate-lactate axis.
This metabolic axis describes the interrelation between three critical metabolic nodes:
central carbon metabolism in the cytoplasm, oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, and lactate
abundance in the extracellular milieu.
During heart failure, this metabolic axis is imbalanced by increased
glycolytic flux coupled to decreased pyruvate oxidation and increased lactate export. In newly published data, I
demonstrated that inhibiting lactate export in the heart, was sufficient to rebalance this axis and mitigate cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure in mice. Suggesting that retaining lactate within the heart is beneficial to its health.
This is further supported by the fact that healthy hearts are net consumers of lactate. Yet, lactate metabolism
remains ill-defined and poorly studied within the heart. This proposal seeks to quantitatively characterize lactate
metabolism in the heart and to test the hypothesis that myocardial lactate production and consumption is integral
to cardiac health by balancing and maintaining the pyruvate-lactate axis in the heart. In my K99 Aim 1, I will use
isotope tracers to quantify lactate production and consumption fluxes in normal cardiomyocytes and hearts. In
my K99 Aim 2, I will define the metabolic rewiring of the pyruvate-lactate axis in chronic heart failure patients
undergoing left ventricle assist device (LVAD) therapy that have been infused with 13C-glucose and compare
failing and recovering human hearts. I will also infuse HF mouse models with 13C-glucose and treat them with
the MCT4 inhibitor VB124, to determine if VB124 is a suitable treatment for LVAD HF patients. In my R00 Aim3,
I will build a research program centered around comprehensively understanding how lactate metabolism is
regulated, and how it impacts hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Collectively, these experiments will lay the
groundwork for targeting of lactate metabolism as a new therapeutic approach in cardiac hypertrophy and heart
failure. Under the guidance of my primary mentor, Co-mentor and my team of collaborators during the K99
period, this proposal will allow me to successfully transition from my current mentored position into an
independent research group leader."
10809730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Latinx children with diagnosed or suspected autism have especially long wait times for diagnoses and
intervention, up to a year or even more. This delayed access to intervention is likely to prevent children from
reaching their full potential in skills and adaptive functioning. A comprehensive, online mobile device-based,
free intervention that can be used by parents while on these wait lists may optimize their child's development.
We have developed such a program, the Online Parent Training in Early Intervention (OPT-In-Early) program.
It teaches parents the fundamental principles of both applied behavior analysis and naturalistic interventions,
uses non-technical language, video demonstrations, guidance in selecting appropriate skills to teach,
embedding teaching into daily routines, and reducing interfering behaviors. It is a self-paced, individualized
platform giving parents strategies to strengthen the parent-child relationship, to teach basic skills, such as
simple communication, to reduce interfering behaviors, and to establish helpful routines. In pilot the RCT,
parents (half of whom were self-identified as Latinx) rated the program very highly and showed positive
changes in behavior and knowledge.
 The goal of the current project is to develop, and pilot test a bilingual Spanish/English culturally tailored
version of OPT-In-Early for Latinx families in the US. First, we will obtain detailed, iterative feedback from
bilingual Latinx parents with an autistic child regarding OPT-In-Early. We will use this feedback to culturally
adapt the program content and format. Next, we will modify the adapted program via user testing with Spanish-
speaking parents. Finally, we will test the bilingual version in a six-month pilot RCT, in preparation for a fully-
powered R01 trial. We will use a wait-list control design: the Intervention Now arm will be given the online
program and the Intervention Later arm (controls) will be given educational material about autism. All children
will receive a baseline and 6-month follow-up assessment, which will measure parent fidelity in using the
intervention principles (the primary outcome), child social communication, level of autism symptoms, impact of
autism symptoms, and degree of developmental delays.
 At the conclusion of this research, we will have developed an evidence-based, comprehensive, freely
available, parent-delivered intervention that can be used by US Latinx families on their mobile devices as they
await diagnosis and intervention. This will increase parent efficacy and reduce their stress, accelerate
children's skills, reduce interfering behavior, and enhance PCPs' willingness to implement universal autism
screening."

This proposal is in response to NIH FOA (PAR-22-126), which “supports exploratory research leading to the
development of innovative technologies for biomedical research...” This R21 project aims to harness the high
sensitivity and resolving power of optical microscopy and asymmetric bipolar microelectrode arrays to develop
a low-cost, highly sensitive bipolar electrochemical array platform for detecting and counting individual
biological target species.
 Many biologically or clinically relevant species, such as certain cancer biomarkers, present at very low
concentrations, sometimes down to a few copies. These species have been difficult to detect and quantify
with existing bioanalytical methods due to their insufficient sensitivity, selectivity, and response speed. To
address this challenge, we propose to develop a bipolar electrochemical single entity bioanalyzer, which
will allow us to analyze individual biological species, such as single viruses and circulating tumor exosomes.
The success of this project builds upon the strong expertise of the PI’s group in bipolar electrochemical arrays,
microfabricated sensors, and single entity electroanalysis and has three specific aims. Aim 1 builds the
asymmetric bipolar microelectrode arrays containing 250,000 electrodes and characterizes and optimizes
them for single entity analysis. Aim 2 will synthesize and characterize Janus Pt/silica nanoparticles (NPs) and
use them to label analyte species pre-concentrated onto magnetic microbeads. Aim 3 will build an integrated
analytical platform by combining the bipolar microelectrode array with optical microscopy, characterize and
optimize its analytical performance for single entity bioanalysis of pseudovirus particles and exosomes.
 The proposed analytical platform is innovative and powerful for single entity bioanalysis due to the use
of an optical signal to amplify and read a small electrochemical signal. The use of a large array of 250,000
bipolar microelectrodes and magnetic beads for pre-concentration further enhances the sensitivity, selectivity,
and throughput. Future work will develop a standalone benchtop analytical instrument, which will be useful
for their general use in research and diagnosis involving single entity bioanalysis."
10840004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term career goal of the K99/R00 applicant, Dr. Stephanie Balters, is to continue her career transition
from engineering and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging into the clinical neuroscience
of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Specifically, her aim is to develop fNIRS neuroimaging methods that
will advance the science of PTSD in addressing questions about brain mechanisms underlying this complex
disorder, with the goal of improving diagnosis and treatment of PTSD (i.e., Precision Medicine). Through her
Ph.D. and postdoctoral training, Dr. Balters has acquired fundamental knowledge in the psychophysiology and
neuroscience of acute and chronic stress; she has advanced the measurement with various psychophysiological
sensors from the laboratory into naturalistic environments (e.g., salivary cortisol, heart rate variability, skin
conductance); she has built novel unobtrusive stress sensors (e.g., steering wheel stress sensor) and subtle
interventions (e.g., Precision Health breathing intervention); has gathered considerable experience in applying
fNIRS neuroimaging within naturalistic environments; and has analyzed existing fNIRS-PTSD datasets.
However, she has not yet conducted an fNIRS study focused on a clinical PTSD population. To facilitate her
career transition to a research faculty position and conduct reliable and safe PTSD neuroimaging research
independently (yet in close collaboration with her licensed clinical colleagues), she further requires essential
research skills and career preparation. Specifically, Dr. Balters will acquire training in 1) the clinical presentation
and diagnosis of PTSD; 2) concurrent fNIRS-fMRI; 3) machine learning algorithms, with focus on Gaussian
Models; and 4) skills for independence. Her short-term goal is to acquire the critical didactic and “hands-on”
training (1-4) during the K99 period, and to apply these new skills in the R00 period independently. The
overarching objective of the proposed K99/R00 research is to develop novel brain imaging methods that enable
the assessment of PTSD brain biomarkers in an affordable, portable, and repeated manner. The central
hypothesis is that aberrant brain function related to PTSD can be measured with fNIRS. Three specific aims will
be addressed: (1) derive cortical biomarkers of PTSD with fNIRS; (2) infer deep brain biomarkers of PTSD with
fNIRS; and (3) assess day-to-day fluctuations of fNIRS biomarkers. Successful completion of this K99/R00
research will make significant inroads to providing scientists access to affordable and valid biomarkers of PTSD
for diagnosis and improved understanding of brain mechanisms underlying PTSD. Dr. Balters will be equipped
with a unique and interdisciplinary skill set to advance PTSD neuroimaging with fNIRS. To bolster her potential
for success, Dr. Balters positioned herself within an outstanding research and academic environment at Stanford
University, secured the support of exceptional advisors who are committed to catalyzing her NIH pathway to
independence, and has developed a strong strategic training plan. Dr. Balters’ completion of the research and
career development plan is indispensable to her transition to an independent career in clinical neuroscience."
10898630,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The devastation wrought by cancer derives primarily from the capacity of tumor cells to evolve. Metastasis,
immune evasion, treatment resistance, and even tumorigenesis itself are evolutionary processes. Our
understanding of tumor evolution is incomplete, evidenced by the ability of some cancers to evolve more
quickly in response to treatment than is compatible with classical genetics. A more comprehensive molecular
understanding of how tumors evolve is key to improving cancer treatment.
 Recent work has shown that oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) is a major
driver of tumor evolution, treatment resistance, and poor outcomes in patients. These circular DNAs are
acentric and have long been thought to asymmetrically segregate at cell division, leading to intratumoral
heterogeneity. We have recently proved this to be the case, but our understanding of the precise mechanisms
through which ecDNA drives tumor evolution remains limited. In this project, Dr. John Rose aims to advance
our understanding of ecDNAs in cancer evolution through unprecedented, well-controlled experimental studies
of ecDNA. First, through a novel approach to image every ecDNA in living cells, I will delineate ecDNA
dynamics on the level of single cells and single ecDNAs (Aim 1a), before extending these findings to organoid
models and analysis of ecDNA+ patient samples (Aim 1b). Second, I will identify the genes that impact ecDNA,
either promoting or inhibiting their accrual in tumor cells, using a high-throughput CRISPR screening strategy
(Aim 2). Finally, I will characterize the development of ecDNAs’ uniquely accessible chromatin structure,
elucidating its etiology (Aim 3). Together, these studies will dramatically improve our understanding of ecDNA
in tumor evolution, while identifying putative avenues for therapeutic intervention.
 This work will be performed in the world-class training environment at Stanford University, under the
mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang, an expert in the application of epigenomics to the study of cancer, and Dr.
Paul Mischel, an expert in extrachromosomal DNA. An advisory committee composed of leaders in the fields of
tumor evolution, computational biology, advanced cell imaging, high-throughput CRISPR screens, and cancer
organoid models will provide additional expertise and mentorship. The first half of each aim will be completed
predominantly during the K99 phase of the award, providing a platform for completion of the aims in the R00
phase."
10836507,"Project 1 Summary
 Transplantation tolerance bears the potential to improve the quality of life of transplant recipients. However,
we have shown that infections/inflammation can break transplantation tolerance. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms induced in alloreactive T cells when tolerance is successful, identifying those that are destabilized
during infections, and those missing in T cells from immunosuppressed non-tolerant hosts will help design
approaches for more durable tolerance. We have used a mouse model of fully mismatched cardiac
transplantation in which a costimulation blockade (CoB)-based treatment results in permanent donor-specific
tolerance. In this model, systemic infection with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), or inflammation, 2 months post-
transplantation precipitate graft rejection in 50% of the animals and erode tolerance in the rest. The 1st cycle of
this program project demonstrated that transplantation tolerance can exist at different levels of robustness and
can be eroded by infection or inflammatory cytokines. In the 2nd (current) cycle of Project 1, we studied the
mechanisms that maintain robust tolerance. First, CD4+ T cells with indirect specificity for a donor MHC-I-peptide
develop a profound state of T cell dysfunction that combines characteristics of exhaustion and anergy, depending
both on graft persistence for ~3 weeks and CD154 blockade. Second, these tolerant T cells maintain better
susceptibility to Treg suppression than memory T cells, due to downregulation of the transcription factor Satb1.
Third, tolerance durably constrains expansion of high avidity T cell clones in polyclonal populations.
 Our preliminary data have identified new vulnerabilities that may prevent long-term graft acceptance. We
found heterogeneity in the level of dysfunction of alloreactive T cells within a tolerant host and identified 2 causes
to this heterogeneity. (i) duration of antigen persistence: high avidity T cells specific for persistently expressed
alloantigens (donor MHC-I) have greater loss of function than high avidity T cells specific for more transient
alloantigens (donor MHC-II); (ii) TCR strength of signal, a product of T cell affinity/avidity and cognate ligand
density, where low avidity T cells are resistant to CoB-mediated dysfunction and preferentially dependent on
suppression by Tregs. Because infections and inflammation can inhibit Treg suppressive function and upregulate
expression of some donor antigens (MHC class II) on the graft, we reason that infections may enable alloreactive
T cells with retained functionality, despite CoB-induced tolerance, to trigger rejection or graft damage.
 We hypothesize that high affinity/avidity Tconvs specific for chronically expressed alloantigens will develop
dysfunction, whereas high avidity T cells recognizing more transiently expressed alloantigens, and low avidity T
cells, will retain function and will have to be durably controlled by Tregs. Rejection triggered by
infection/inflammation might thus be due to these more functional T cells escaping Treg suppression. Aim 1.
Investigate the mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in T cell dysfunction due to different duration of
alloantigen expression. Aim 2. Define the role of low avidity T cells as a vulnerability to long-term graft stability."
10836516,"Project 2 Summary
 Transplantation tolerance promises to facilitate long-term allograft acceptance while avoiding the need for
life-long immunosuppression and its associated problems. In the past decade, operational clinical transplantation
tolerance has been achievable through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or weaning of conventional
immunosuppression. However, the vast majority of transplant recipients fail to achieve allograft tolerance, and a
subset of operationally tolerant transplant recipients eventually experience graft loss. High frequencies of
memory alloreactive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells have been identified as potent barriers to the successful induction of
transplantation tolerance. There continues to be an urgent need to identify new strategies for overcoming the
barrier posed by memory T cells; Project 2 proposes to address this need. We recently showed that memory T
cells resist infectious tolerance mechanisms, and cannot acquire the cell-intrinsic hypofunctional states attained
by naïve T cells. Moreover, in sensitized recipients harboring memory T cells directed to just a single donor
antigen, we reported that the larger repertoire of naïve donor-specific CD4+ Tconv also develops resistance to
co-stimulation blockade-induced tolerance. We refer to this phenomenon as “linked sensitization” and posit that
understanding the mechanism underlying this barrier to co-stimulation blockade-induced allograft tolerance is
not only relevant to recipients with heterologous memory T cells, but also can lead to the identification of new
targets that synergize with co-stimulation blockade to achieve transplantation tolerance. Aim 1 will focus on
defining the mechanism of linked sensitization. Our observations that memory T cells are resistant to being
programmed into cell-intrinsic hypofunctional states identify a gap in knowledge as to whether, and how, memory
T cells may be programmed to tolerance. To this end, we leveraged the physiologically powerful processes of
pregnancy that program T cells specific for the semi-allogeneic fetus to spontaneously accept subsequent
offspring-matched heart allografts. Remarkably, we show that pregnancy is able to program memory T cells,
generated by the rejection of fully mismatched skin grafts, to become hypofunctional and susceptible to co-
stimulation blockade-induced transplant tolerance. We will define the mechanisms by which pregnancy programs
hypofunction in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in Aims 2 and 3, respectively. The proposed studies have direct relevance
to post-partum transplant recipients, and will likely yield a conceptual and potentially therapeutic roadmap for
programming hypofunction and susceptibility to co-stimulation blockade-induced transplant tolerance in memory
T cells. Thus, insights gained from our studies will ultimately be applicable to sensitized transplant recipients of
both sexes."
10808193,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a devastating malignancy that may arise from precursor mucosal
lesions, called oral premalignant lesions (OPLs). OPLs consist of low- and high-grade dysplasia (ODs).
Although most low-grade ODs remain stable for years and some even regress spontaneously, a significant
minority of them (4-11%) rapidly develop OSCC. Currently, there is no biomarker available for screening low-
grade ODs to identify those at high risk of developing OSCC to implement evidence-based cancer prevention
management. Several studies reported DNA methylation changes in oral carcinogenesis, but failed to address
the differences between progressive vs. static low-grade ODs or generate whole genome coverage with
sufficient width and depth for maximal new discoveries. Our long-term goal is to understand the epigenetic
mechanisms that drive the malignant progression of precancerous lesions. The objective of this R21 is to
discover new differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with OPL progression using a whole-
genome single-nucleotide-resolution approach, create novel DMR-based models, and validate their power in
predicting the progression of low-grade ODs to OSCC. The central hypothesis of this R21 states that the
progression of OPLs to OSCC is driven by DNA methylation changes that can be discovered by whole-genome
DMR analysis of progressive vs. static OPLs and used to predict the cancer risk of OPLs for management
decision. This hypothesis is formulated based on the scientific premises that: 1) epigenetic modification is a
key disease-driving mechanism that captures early carcinogenic environment-gene interaction events and is
faithfully preserved throughout disease progression, and 2) DNA methylation changes have been shown to
occur in ODs and OSCC compared to normal oral epithelium. The rationale for pursuing the proposed research
is that once the spectrum of DMRs between the progressive and static ODs are identified based on high quality
data and powerful analysis, we will discover key DMR sites that drive and predict the malignant progression of
low-grade ODs, which would otherwise be missed. Aim 1 will discover genomic regions differentially
methylated in progressive vs. static low-grade ODs using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on
samples with longitudinal follow-ups. Aim 2 will create DMR-based models and validate their power in
predicting the risk of low-grade ODs in progression to OSCC. A successful completion is expected to discover
new DMRs capable of differentiating progressive vs. static ODs and create novel risk-prediction DMR models.
The outcome will fill the critical need for a sensitive and reliable screening method to predict the risk of OPLs in
becoming OSCCs at an early stage, when medical interventions are more effective and less damaging, which
will lead to a direct impact on reducing the incidence of OSCC and related health issues, as well as finding
novel DNA methylation mechanisms driving the malignant progression of OSCC that may be druggable. It may
also have a broad impact on advancing research on other tobacco-related HNSCC."
10824321,"ABSTRACT
Minimally displaced femoral neck fractures have traditionally been treated with internal fixation because an
open reduction is rarely required and the fixation devices can be implanted with little surgical dissection. As
such, internal fixation of minimally displaced fractures is perceived to have a relatively low risk of complications
and mortality. However, recent data suggests that patients treated with internal fixation experience high
complication rates. Recent research has suggested arthroplasty could result in superior outcomes, reducing
the risk of major reoperations, decreasing mortality, and improving mobility. While the preliminary data
supporting the use of arthroplasty for minimally displaced fractures is promising, clinical practice would benefit
from a definitive trial that clearly defines the optimal surgical treatment for patients with these fracture types.
Addressing this need, we propose a multi-center randomized controlled trial designed to determine if
arthroplasty is superior to internal fixation in patients with a minimally displaced femoral neck fracture. If
arthroplasty outcomes are superior to internal fixation in the proposed trial, it will provide a rationale for
widespread changes in treatment and improve the care of thousands of patients each year. In order to
successfully implement this landmark trial, we propose an 18-month planning period. We will leverage our
team’s experience designing, implementing, and conducting multi-center randomized controlled trials to
develop a feasible and patient-centered trial. During the planning period, we will complete the following three
specific aims: 1) Finalize the patient-centered trial protocol; 2) Establish trial infrastructure, and 3) Prepare the
clinical sites for initiation."
10807034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sleep is critical to health and well-being, such that current trends towards reduced sleep time and quality,
coupled with rising diagnoses of sleep disorders, negatively affect multiple physiological systems. Increasing
clinical evidence indicates that sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contribute to chronic pain,
with over 40% of sleep disordered patients reporting chronic pain conditions. However, there is a gap in
knowledge concerning how disorders such as intermittent hypoxia contribute to persistent pain. Our long-term
goal is to reduce persistent pain in patients experiencing sleep disorders. As we work towards this goal, the
overall objective of this application is to define the mechanism by which intermittent hypoxia contributes to the
transition from acute-to-chronic pain. Our central hypothesis is that hypoxia from sleep disorders produces
neuroimmune hyperalgesic priming via peripheral macrophage up-regulation. We propose that chronic
intermittent hypoxia stimulates macrophage polarization to increase inflammatory cytokine production in
peripheral nociceptive tissues. Our hypothesis is based on strong evidence utilizing an innovative rodent model
for chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) that mimics OSA. The rationale for this work is that increasing our
mechanistic understanding of how intermittent hypoxia contributes to persistent pain could improve quality of life
for tens of millions of American that suffer from sleep disorders. To accomplish our objective, we will test our
central hypothesis with the following related, yet interdependent aims: (1) Identify the location of neuroimmune
interaction, (2) Interrogate the distribution and role of M1/M2 macrophage polarization, and (3) Examine hypoxic
activation of peripheral macrophages. We propose a multi-disciplinary approach to testing our hypothesis,
utilizing transgenic and Cre-Lox recombination mice in biochemical, pharmacological, in vivo imaging and
behavioral protocols with FACS cell sorting and RNA profiling in tandem. Our CIH treatment paradigm is highly
innovative for its translational relevance to human OSA, as is our molecular and biochemical profiling of resident
and infiltrating macrophage populations in hyperalgesic priming. The proposed research is significant because
it will identify novel mechanisms by which sleeping disorders contribute to persistent pain."
10877732,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."
10870088,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Herpes zoster (HZ, or shingles) is a major cause of morbidity, affecting one in three Americans during their
lifetime. HZ can be particularly devastating when it involves the eye (herpes zoster ophthalmicus, HZO) and can
result in permanent vision loss. The FDA approved a highly effective HZ vaccine (Shingrix, recombinant zoster
vaccine [RZV]) in late 2017 for ages 50 and above. Our group published the first post-licensure observational
studies of real-world effectiveness of RZV using two years of data. Long-term monitoring of RZV uptake,
effectiveness and safety, as well as its impact on HZ/HZO incidence is critical to guide vaccination efforts.
During our current R01 grant period, we found that incidence rates of HZ/HZO increased significantly from 2007
to 2018 in the middle-aged groups. In this current proposal, we propose to assess the incidence in the era of
RZV vaccination to determine if the incidence is increasing in age groups which are not currently eligible for
vaccination (Aim 1). This could have ramifications for policies regarding age recommendations for RZV. Despite
the high efficacy of RZV, there is concern that vaccine uptake may be low among specific demographic groups
due to early shortages and healthcare disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no studies on RZV
vaccination coverage of the eligible US population, but an understanding of factors associated with lower
likelihood of vaccination, including social determinants of health, could help better target vaccination efforts (Aim
2).
Our previous studies were the first to demonstrate high short-term effectiveness of RZV in general practice, and
we now propose to assess how long the protection against HZ and HZO will last (Aim 3). Additionally, we will
provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness and waning in the immunocompromised subgroup, a group at high
risk for HZ which was excluded from clinical trials. Understanding the long-term vaccine effectiveness is critical
for informing vaccine policy recommendations for different groups, including the need for and timing of re-
vaccination. Lastly, patients with a history of HZO are a subgroup for which there are concerns regarding RZV
vaccination, as reflected in a survey conducted by our group showing hesitancy among cornea specialists to
recommend RZV. This uncertainty may be due to a lack of evidence on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy to
inform clinical recommendations for this patient population. We will determine whether there is an increased risk
of post-RZV HZO exacerbations, and we will estimate the effectiveness of RZV in preventing future recurrences
and exacerbations of HZO in patients with a history of HZO (Aim 4). Rigorous information on the relative risks
and benefits of RZV will facilitate making evidence-based recommendations regarding vaccination."
10836552,"Project Summary. Exposure to childhood adversity is one of the strongest risk factors for depression
across the life course, increasing risk by at least twofold. Although these exposures are clearly harmful,
there is substantial variation in how people respond to adversity; not all children who experience early-life
adversity go on to develop mental health problems. This finding raises the question: Are there modifiable
factors early in life that protect against the effects of adversity, contribute to resilient biological processes,
and prevent new onsets of depression? Family- and community-level factors, including maternal social
support, parenting behaviors, grandparent involvement, peer support, and school quality, are established
promotive factors for depression, even among children with a history of adversity. Emerging research
also suggests DNA methylation (DNAm), a well-studied epigenetic modification, may function as a
pathway to explain the biological embedding of these promotive factors. Yet, prior studies in this field
have been small, cross-sectional, and focused mostly on candidate genes. As such, our interdisciplinary
team seeks to considerably advance these insights by identifying the extent to which DNAm mediates, or
partially explains, the effect of these positive life experiences on risk for depression across childhood to
adulthood. We will study these relationships in two birth cohorts: the US-based Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) and the UK-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC). Both cohorts are rare in containing repeated measures of positive life experiences, childhood
adversities, DNAm, symptom and/or diagnostic markers of depression risk, and indicators of positive
adaptation. Leveraging our team’s track-record of identifying adversity-linked sensitive periods for DNAm
and depression, we will capitalize on these data to pursue three aims. In all aims, we will model risk (i.e.,
childhood adversity exposure) and positive life experiences simultaneously, which few studies have done
before. In Aim 1, we will characterize the time-dependent effects of positive life experiences on
depression from childhood to adulthood. In Aim 2, we will investigate the time-varying impacts of positive
life experiences on DNAm patterns and trajectories. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use a two-stage structured
life-course modeling approach (SLCMA) our team developed for high-dimensional data. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the extent to which these DNAm patterns explain the relationship between positive life
experiences and depression using statistical mediation. In sum, this study will: 1) identify modifiable
positive life experiences that shape DNAm and depression patterns, 2) determine if there are sensitive
periods when these experiences are more influential in shaping these outcomes, and 3) generate
insights about promotive and protective biological mechanisms that could lead to new targeted
interventions that benefit all children and mitigate the effects of adversity for those who are exposed."
10802373,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is vital for spatial navigation, learning and memory, and is extensively interconnected with
many cortical and subcortical regions. In addition to the well-defined long-range glutamatergic projections,
emerging evidence suggests that a diverse group of GABAergic inhibitory neurons can also send long-range
projections to distant areas. This long-range inhibition is ideally positioned to synchronize rhythmic activity and
coordinate cell ensemble activity of multiple brain areas to participate in various behavioral tasks. One such
example is theta oscillations – a 4-12 Hz rhythmic activity important for memory encoding and retrieval.
However, despite the potential importance of the long-range inhibition in coordinating activity between the
hippocampus and other brain regions, its cell identity, electrophysiological properties, connectivity, and
behavioral roles remain poorly understood. In our preliminary experiments, we performed anterograde tracing
to demonstrate that somatostatin-expressing, but not parvalbumin-expressing, inhibitory neurons in the
hippocampal CA3 region project to two subcortical areas known as pacemakers for theta oscillations – medial
septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DB) and supramammillary nucleus (SUM) in the hypothalamus. Ex vivo
ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted patch-clamp recordings further revealed that these long-range inhibitory
neurons preferentially inhibit presumptive GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in MS-DB and GABAergic
neurons in SUM, and optogenetic stimulation of somatostatin-expressing axons robustly entrained firing of
postsynaptic MS-DB neurons at theta frequencies. We, therefore, hypothesize that somatostatin-expressing
inhibitory neurons in CA3 send long-range projection to coordinate cell ensemble activity of CA3, MS-DB and
SUM during theta oscillations. In this proposal, we will perform intersectional viral-based neural tracing and ex
vivo brain-slice patch-clamp recordings to define anatomical connectivity and cellular and synaptic properties
of long-range projecting somatostatin-expressing neurons, and determine their functional connections with
both local and remote target regions. Furthermore, we will employ in vivo electrophysiology, closed-loop
optogenetic stimulation, and behavior analysis to determine whether these long-range somatostatin-expressing
inhibitory neurons play a role in coordinating activity between the hippocampus and MS-DB or SUM in memory
formation. As abnormalities in coordination and synchronization between the hippocampus and other brain
areas have been implicated in numerous brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and
major depression, the proposed studies will not only deepen our understanding of physiological functions of
hippocampal long-range inhibition, but also provide a knowledge base for future studies to examine the role of
long-range inhibition in these diseases."

Cardiac muscle generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is being
increasingly used to model heart injury and regeneration. The lack of maturity, multicellular
composition, perfusable vasculature and patient specificity remain the key limitations of currently
available cardiac tissue models. Several advances, achieved in our labs during the previous grant
cycle, form the basis for the proposed patient specific studies of viral myocarditis and ischemia-
reperfusion injury: (i) Derivation of multiple cell types that compose native myocardium (cardiac
myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, circulating and
resident macrophages), all from the same starting human iPSCs for biological complexity and
patient specificity. (ii) Perfusable microvascular networks serving as a template for engineering
vascularized cardiac muscle. (iii) Ability to link tissues by vascular perfusion in a way allowing the
maintenance of the individual tissue niches while enabling cross-talk by circulating cells,
extracellular vesicles (EVs) and secreted factors. (iv) Development of an isogenic model of bone
marrow, serving as a source of immune cells when linked to the cardiac muscle by vascular flow.
(v) Models of viral myocarditis and ischemia-reperfusion injury, with data indicating the sex
specificity and therapeutic effects of EVs. We propose to build upon these advances and
bioengineer patient-specific vascularized human cardiac microbundles to study the individual
differences under normal conditions, and following the viral myocarditis, ischemic injury and EV
treatment. We hypothesize that the vascularized cardiac muscle of such a high maturity and
biological fidelity will be able to capture sex-specific responses to cardiac injury. To test this
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims that will be pursued in an integrated fashion, with the
outcomes of each aim informing the other two aims. Aim 1 is to engineer multicellular, patient-
specific, vascularized cardiac microbundles. Aim 2 is to deploy vascularized cardiac microbundles
in modeling acute viral myocarditis, for which males are at a higher risk. Aim 3 is to deploy
vascularized cardiac microbundles in modeling acute and sustained ischemia-reperfusion injury,
with females are at a higher risk. For both Aim 2 and Aim 3, we will also study the cell-protective
measures of EVs and miRNAs in their cargo. We believe that this work will have impact on both
the biological research and the treatment of heart injury and disease."

mathematical systems physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Towards this goal, a series of in
vitro, in vivo, and in silico investigations in translationally relevant preclinical species are proposed to obtain
unprecedented quantitative insight into the processes responsible for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination (ADME) of drug-laden polymer nanoparticles. In addition, all the preclinical data will be

To date, there is no effective treatment for cognitive impairment and dementia. Understanding mechanisms
that promote cognitive resilience and delay vascular dementia, particularly in high-risk populations, is a
complimentary approach to extend cognitive health span. Ischemic stroke survivors represent a growing
population among older adults in the U.S. and a very high-risk group for Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). Beyond the underlying burden of brain infarction, biological factors and molecular
mechanisms that elicit differences in cognitive resilience and timing of dementia onset after stroke, remain
unclear. Biological aging processes at the physiological level are associated with risk of age-related diseases
including cognition, stroke and dementia. However, it remains poorly understood if differences in biological
aging explain variabilities in post-stroke ADRD. At the molecular level, among recognized aging biology
mechanisms, the proteome plays a central role as proteins control cell functions, can help identify novel
therapeutic targets and are associated with cognitive trajectories in aging. However, these associations were
restricted to post-mortem assessments and have not been assessed in accessible tissue such as peripheral
blood and in vulnerable populations such as ischemic stroke survivors. The immediate objective of this
application is to assess the role of biological aging and molecular proteomic mechanisms in cognitive resilience
and timing of onset of vascular dementia among ischemic stroke survivors. I will measure biological aging
using physiological biomarkers data collected from blood tests in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and
the Rotterdam Study (RS). I will then integrate these phenotypes with state-of-the art clinical ascertainment of
stroke and cognition over >15 years of follow-up to assess the role of biological aging differences in cognitive
resilience after stroke. I will leverage an Aptamer-based proteomic platform to identify molecular networks and
cellular-level pathways of biological aging, cognitive resilience and vascular dementia among stroke survivors
and healthy controls. I will evaluate algorithms of combined biological aging, proteomic and clinical stroke data
for prognosis of cognitive resilience and domain-specific cognitive outcomes using supervised machine
learning. I am well suited to perform this research based on 1) my prior research experience in epidemiology of
stroke and aging, 2) the outstanding mentoring team to ensure this research is of highest quality; and 3) the
exceptional research environment to support my career development. The proposed training and research will
help me acquire substantive new skills in molecular epidemiology, high-dimensional data and machine learning
to establish an independent career as a researcher at the intersection of molecular epidemiology and ADRD in
vulnerable populations. This project will enable unprecedented perspectives on biological and molecular
mechanisms of cognitive resilience to uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to protect cognitive
health in old age among ischemic stroke survivors."
10883741,"ATP1A1 is the only Na/K-ATPase (NKA) isoform expressed in the kidney. As stated in physiology textbooks,
NKA is the enzymatic machinery that powers energy storage in the form of a transmembrane Na+ gradient, which
is essential for renal salt handling and the control of blood pressure. In the renal proximal tubule (RPT), activation
of NKA-mediated classic ion transport function decreases natriuresis through activation of both basolateral (NKA)
and apical (NHE3) Na+ reabsorption. In contrast, activation of the more recently discovered NKA signaling
function triggers a cellular redistribution of both NKA and NHE3 in RPT cells, which decreases Na+ uptake.
Hence, RPT NKA simultaneously serves two opposing roles in Na+ handling: anti-natriuretic through its classic
ATPase-driven ion transport function, and natriuretic through its more recently recognized receptor/signaling
function. To date, the relative contributions of these two NKA functions to the net RPT Na+ handling in vivo is a
fundamentally and therapeutically essential question that has been virtually impossible to answer. NKA signaling,
which is both distinct and independent from NKA classic enzymatic ion-transporting function, was first brought
to the attention of the scientific community by the work of Dr. Zijian Xie in ouabain-treated cardiac myocytes and
renal epithelial cells. Mechanistically, binding of NKA specific ligands such as the cardiotonic steroid (CTS)
ouabain activates Src, resulting in the activation of multiple protein/lipid kinases and the generation of
intracellular second messengers. Numerous groups around the world have expanded the concept of non-
enzymatic signaling function of NKA, while we have focused on the mechanism by which NKA is engaged in
direct interaction with several signaling and scaffolding proteins including Src. This has allowed us to develop
ATP1A1 mutants with intact enzymatic function but defective ability of interaction with signaling partners.
Critically, we have developed a hypomorphic mouse (RPTα1-/-) with a RPT-specific reduction of 70% of NKA α1.
The hyper-reabsorptive renal phenotype of this mouse suggests that NKA signaling is not only physiologically
relevant, but also functionally prevalent in the regulation of RPT Na+ handling. We have established feasibility of
RPT-specific rescue of the hypomorphic RPTα1-/- mouse with either wild-type or Src-binding null mutant forms
of NKA, and propose to use those new tools to test the central hypothesis that NKA α1 (ATP1A1) exerts a tonic
inhibition of apical NHE3 and basolateral Na+ transporters in the RPT. We further surmise that this regulatory
mechanism has a prevalent regulatory role in RPT Na+ handling (Aim 1), depends on NKA α1/Src interaction
(Aim 2), and enables NKA α1 ligands such as CTS to modulate RPT Na+ reabsorption (Aim 3).
Successful completion of the proposed investigation shall reveal a hitherto unrecognized regulatory mechanism
of salt handling by RPT NKA α1, the molecular basis of this regulation, an integrated compensatory transport
network, and their impact on renal physiology and the development of salt sensitivity."

Parkinsonism, the second most common movement disorder, affects over 900,000 Americans and its prevalence
is rising, while dystonia, the third most common, afflicts 250,000 Americans. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism
(XDP) is a rare neurogenetic movement disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from a parkinsonism
indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease (PD), generalized dystonia, similar to DYT1 (a hereditary dystonia),
or combined dystonia and parkinsonism. Female XDP carriers are at risk for parkinsonism, given X-inactivation
and represents a possible genetic risk factor. As such, XDP serves as an excellent model of both dystonia and
parkinsonism, and insights can inform both phenotypes and mixed movement disorders, which are notoriously
challenging to assess. To provide adequate clinical trial endpoints, rater-independent, quantitative assessments
of motor function are urgently needed to identify early abnormalities which may predate overt clinical symptoms
and track disease progression, given the unreliability of rater-dependent clinical rating scales. This project will
provide Dr. Stephen with a skill set that will allow him to assess potential quantitative measures of disease
severity and progression in dystonia and parkinsonism using motion sensors and compare these measures with
proposed biochemical biomarkers, using machine learning to define optimal parameters. This project aims to
address three key knowledge gaps in dystonia and parkinsonism, using pure phenotypes (DYT1 and PD) and in
combination (XDP): Aim 1) to utilize technology-based evaluations as more sensitive and accurate measures of
dystonia in isolation (DYT1) vs. in combination with parkinsonism (XDP) compared to clinical scales; Aim 2) to
examine the accuracy of sensor-based monitoring of disease progression over 1 year in XDP, PD and DYT1
patients; and Aim 3) to analyze 2 proposed blood biomarkers (one specific to XDP, and neurofilament light chain,
a general marker of neurodegeneration) in XDP and combine these motor and blood markers, using machine
learning to predict disease phenotype/biotype and clinical course. This research complements the NINDS
objective of clinical trial readiness in rare neurological disorders, with a wider goal of better understanding these
common phenotypes in the context of a mixed movement disorder, using innovative technology and analysis
methods. The goal of this award is to prepare the candidate to become a fully independent investigator in the
quantitative assessment of dystonia, parkinsonism and other movement disorders, in the setting of expert
mentorship. The career development plan includes training goals: 1) learning transferrable motion analysis skills,
2) learning machine learning techniques to develop predictive models of motor behaviors and combining these
with blood biomarker data; and 3) an introduction to biomarker science and bioinformatics. Successful
completion of this project will put Dr. Stephen in a unique position to inform clinical trial readiness efforts in XDP,
relevant to other dystonia and to prepare for submission of a competitive R01 application focusing on quantitative
movement analysis and biofluid markers in genetic dystonia, parkinsonism and mixed movement disorders."

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project and the HapMap Project, genetic science has identified a
wealth of associations between common or rare variants and human complex traits, including diseases. GWAS
has arguably been the most successful tool in this so called “post-genomic” era, yielding almost 200,000 robust
associations between common SNPs and more than 5,000 human traits. However, because of linkage
disequilibrium, GWAS only report genomic “signals” or “loci” tagged by index SNPs and not the underlying true
causal variants. Even more crucially, GWAS cannot indicate the effector genes at these loci, which are necessary
to translate these findings into development of new therapies for disease. The main challenges to identifying
causal variants and effector genes are that 1) the majority of variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding
regions of the genome and are thought to regulate gene expression, often hundreds of kb away in linear distance
and 2) gene expression regulation is exquisitely tissue and cell type specific. While consortia such as ENCODE
and GTEx have already built high quality, publicly available genome-wide datasets for many epigenetic markers
and gene expression in different tissues and cell types, some limitations exist such as the number and
heterogeneity of cell and tissue types available, the use of post-mortem samples, and the limited power due to
the large sample number needed for QTL studies. As an alternative approach, I propose a variant-to-gene
mapping campaign based on genome-wide high-resolution, promoter-focused Capture C, a technique that
detects contacts between different regions of the genome in 3D space. Coupled with other genomic techniques,
i.e. ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, this approach will allow us to identify putative causal variants residing
in open chromatin and with enhancer signatures, and their (transcriptionally active) effector genes (including
non-coding RNAs). Importantly, this proposal will focus on brain-related traits and disorders, a field where many
GWAS signals have been reported, but only a few have been definitely linked to their effector genes, including
many neurodegenerative disorders still lacking effective therapies. Using a tractable in vitro model system such
as human iPSC-derived neural cell types (neurons, astrocytes and microglia, including co-cultures and brain
organoids), I will be able to incorporate a temporal and functional dimension to these studies, which will help us
identify mechanisms of disease etiology and progression in neuro-developmental and neurodegenerative
disorders. Importantly, the functional genomics studies proposed will be performed in cell lines derived from
individuals of different sex and ethnicity, to explore sex and ethnicity -specific differences in gene regulation."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."

 Over the past several decades, the traditional approach to combating viral infectious
diseases has been to target the virus itself, in most cases by either blocking virus-encoded
enzymes that are required for viral replication, or by preventing the virus from entering host cells.
One of the major caveats of these approaches has been the ability of the virus to readily mutate
and thereby become resistant to these classical types of antiviral therapies. In fact, this is a
serious problem for the therapy of RNA virus infections, such as HIV or influenza virus, which are
known to rapidly mutate and thereby escape antiviral drugs. Additionally, traditional antiviral
approaches are designed to target a specific virus, and therefore are ineffective against any new
virus that may emerge in the future, and it is impossible to predict what virus will cause the next
outbreak or pandemic. Therefore, there is the urgent need to develop new ways for targeting viral
pathogens, which will require creative and innovative research.
 Like human proteins, viral proteins robustly undergo posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) for their regulation and proper functioning in the virus life cycle. In most cases, viral PTMs
are dynamically regulated by human enzymes, such as kinases/phosphatases, ubiquitin E3
ligases/deubiquitinating enzymes, or acetyl transferases/deacetylases. Thus, cellular enzymes
play an important role in controlling the ability of the virus to replicate and to cause disease.
 This proposal’s overarching goal is to comprehensively map the ‘viral PTMome’ to identify
the PTMs that are essential for virus replication and pathogenesis. We will combine proteomics
screens and molecular virology approaches including reverse genetics techniques with cutting-
edge molecular, biochemical and biophysical studies. This will allow us to identify and
characterize viral PTMs and the responsible host modifying enzymes, as well as to determine
their roles for effective viral replication and pathogenesis. This powerful approach, combined with
collaborative studies to design and test chemical inhibitors to block the enzymes that regulate
critical viral PTMs, will not only provide unique mechanistic insight into host control of virus
replication but will also lay the groundwork for developing new antivirals for a range of emerging
viral infectious diseases."

 Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receive the maximum cumulative anthracycline exposure
during frontline therapy (>440 mg/m2), an exposure that causes very well-described cardiac complications. The
importance of acute, short-term cardiotoxicity in pediatric AML has been described recently by our group using
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) clinical trial data. Specifically, nearly 40% of patients experienced left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) warranting chemotherapy modifications, and 21% suffered LVSD
consistent with moderate to life-threatening cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Over 70% of LVSD was first
documented during frontline therapy and was associated with a 13% absolute decrease in overall survival
(OS). Notably, the decline in OS from early cardiotoxicity is larger than the improvement from any randomized
intervention reported to date in pediatric AML cooperative group trials. Despite this clinical impact, there are no
clinical prediction models for early chemotherapy associated cardiac toxicity. The cardiotoxicity prediction
models developed to date focus exclusively on long-term childhood cancer survivors due to the absence of a
sufficiently large and well-characterized de novo AML cohort. The variability in guidelines and clinical practice
is fertile ground for disparities in echo monitoring and identification of cardiac outcomes, yet the well described
disparities in survival outcomes by race/ethnicity in pediatric AML have not included analyses of echo
adherence or cardiac dysfunction.With this application, we propose to develop a highly unique dataset
including detailed demographic, clinical, genomic, treatment, and toxicity data, combined with longitudinal
indices of LV size, diastolic, and systolic function from all clinical surveillance echocardiograms for patients
enrolled on two COG AML trials, AAML0531 and AAML1031. With this unique data set, we will use novel,
sophisticated analytic methods to develop models that: (1) continually update predictions of early cardiotoxicity
risk during frontline therapy, (2) predict LV functional trajectories leading to persistent or worsening LVSD in
the early/moderate time window after AML therapy, and (3) compare cancer treatment outcomes (EFS and
OS) and detection of LVSD for three cardiotoxicity monitoring schedules with different echo frequencies in
pediatric AML patients. The first model should enable personalized chemotherapy modifications and earlier
initiation of cardiac-directed medications, thus improving survival outcomes. The second model should inform
more personalized, evidence-based recommendations for off-treatment cardiotoxicity surveillance, potentially
leading to improved adherence and reducing costs of unnecessary testing. The third analyses will provide a
data driven guidance for on-therapy echocardiogram monitoring for pediatric patients with AML."
10841575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep stabilizes memories in cortical regions and optimizes synaptic organization, freeing up the hippocampus
for ongoing learning. In early childhood, naps serve a critical function, enhancing memory through sleep-
dependent memory consolidation. Given this, it remains unknown why children transition out of naps when they
are still in a stage rich with learning. We predict that critical brain development occurs at this time, making the
mid-day “unloading” of memories no longer essential. Here we propose the first longitudinal study of the
cognitive, physiological, and neural changes that accompany the nap transition. The central hypothesis is that
maturation of the brain (in particular, the hippocampus) during early childhood results in more information being
retained without interference, reducing the need for frequent consolidation that takes place during naps. We posit
that these changes contribute to the biphasic (nap and overnight sleep) to monophasic (overnight sleep) sleep
transition. To examine this, we will recruit 180 participants (36-54 months) and use a longitudinal design to
assess brain development in relation to memory, sleep physiology, and nap status across the nap transition.
Nap status will be monitored in real-time with actigraphy and verified via parent-reported ecological momentary
assessments. Sleep will be assessed with polysomnography during the nap and overnight sleep. Memory will
be assessed with a mnemonic similarity task, designed to tap hippocampal-dependent memory. Assessments
will occur before and after a nap (with an equivalent interval awake as a control) and again before and after
subsequent overnight sleep. Brain macro/micro structure and anatomical/functional connectivity will be
measured with MRI. Aim 1 is to identify neural markers that predict the shift from biphasic to monophasic sleep.
Aim 2 is to examine changes in sleep-dependent memory processing across the sleep transition. Aim 3 is to
examine changes in diurnal and nocturnal sleep microstructure and topography across the sleep transition. Aim
4 is to examine interrelations among sleep architecture, memory, and the brain across the sleep transition using
latent change score modeling. Innovative aspects of the proposed work include: real-time tracking of nap
transitions longitudinally within the same subjects; examination of nap and overnight sleep microstructure and
topography; comprehensive and targeted measures of brain development; measures of hippocampal-mediated
memory; and latent change score modeling. This work will also result in a novel and rich dataset for additional
analyses by our group and others to test alternative outcomes, explore the contribution of additional brain
regions, and assess additional hypotheses from other prominent sleep theories. This work will have significant
implications for human health by enhancing understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep regulation and
the consequences of sleep on cognitive health and performance and identification of biomarkers in sleep which
may be useful in identifying risk and health outcomes."

The mission of the Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (P3) is to discover biological
transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes predictive
of risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Each year ~1.5 million American women enter into the perimenopause, a
neuroendocrine transition state unique to the female. Herein, we focus on the neuro-immune system as a key
driver of chronological and endocrinological aging that occurs in the midlife female brain. Our goals are to identify
the mechanisms by which these transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to
prevent conversion to an at-Alzheimer's-risk phenotype. Project 1 contributes to meeting P3 goals by determining
the mechanisms, at the cellular level, by which brain- and systemic metabolic transformations modulate
neuroimmune systems in the female aging brain and their interactions with the APOE4 gene. This mission will
be accomplished through cell-type-specific, inter-cellular, and cross-organ analyses of metabolic and
neuroinflammatory cascades perturbed in brain and metabolic organs during the perimenopausal transition and
their impact on developing an at-AD-risk phenotype. We propose that metabolic reprogramming across brain
cell types regulates the inflammatory cascade throughout perimenopause and leads to AD-like phenotypes. We
further propose that perimenopause-induced perturbations to peripheral metabolism also contribute to brain
immune phenotypes via shift in fuel supply and reshaping of peripheral inflammatory profile. To test our
hypotheses, we will implement three levels of mechanistic investigations: 1) cell type-specific bioenergetic-
inflammatory interactions, 2) intercellular crosstalk that propagates neuroimmune signals, and 3) brain-periphery
communications that transduce systemic metabolic status. Aim 1 is designed to characterize the cell type-
specific changes underlying the metabolic-inflammatory transformations during the perimenopausal transition
and the perturbation by ApoE4. The goal of Aim 2 is to determine cellular- and intercellular mechanisms that
bridge metabolic- and neuroinflammatory phenotypes occurring throughout the perimenopausal transition. Aim
3 will determine how peripheral metabolic changes induced by perimenopause and ApoE4 contribute to
metabolic-immune responses in the brain. Outcomes from this research will provide novel insight to the cell type-
specific and inter-cellular mechanisms underlying the perimenopause- and ApoE4 modifications of AD risk and
has the potential to identify ApoE genotype-specific and cell type-specific therapeutic targets to maintain or
restore the metabolic-inflammatory homeostasis in female aging brain. The P3 program of research addresses
key strategic goals of the National Institutes on Aging’s 2016: Aging Well in the 21st Century: Strategic Directions
for Research on Aging, specifically Goals A (1,2,3,7,8,11) & D (1,2,4)."

the dynamic conversions in immune transcriptome and phenotype, the contributing cells, the map of neural
immune responses and therapeutics that specifically target each stage of immune conversion. The overall
hypothesis guiding Project 2 program of research is that the immune system is the initiator and driver of the
metabolic crisis in brain. Based on our preliminary evidence, we anticipate that the neuro-immune profile in brain
will be dynamic and endocrine aging stage dependent. Further, we hypothesize that APOE genotype will be a
key regulator of the neuro-immune system of biology in brain. Aim 1 addresses fundamental systems biology of
the interface between the bioenergetic and immune systems in brain. Aim 1 analyses will determine the dynamic
neuro-immune genotypic/phenotypic signatures that emerge over the course of the pre, peri, and
postmenopausal transition. The goal of Aim 2 is to establish a foundation for precision immune modulating
therapies for reduction of Alzheimer’s disease risk in women based on endocrine aging status and APOE
genotype which will be achieved through computational medical bioinformatics strategies. The translational goal
of Aim 3 is to create a platform for precision neuro-immune therapy based on APOE4 genetic burden and
endocrine aging status. Aim 3 objectives will be achieved by: 1) integrating neuro-immune signatures derived
from Aim 1 with therapeutic candidates from Aim 2; 2) treating hAPOE mice with neuro-immune therapy specific
to endocrine aging transition; 3) determining efficacy of precision neuro-immune therapy to prevent, delay and
treat hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease. Collectively, outcomes of these analyses will provide a
platform on which to achieve precision neuro-immune medicine to intervene with the right therapy at the right
time in the right APOE genotype.

Neural crest cells (NC) are unique to vertebrates, arise early in development, emigrate from the dorsal aspect of
the neural tube, and differentiate into a plethora of derivatives throughout the body, contributing neurons and glia
of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and craniofacial bone and cartilage amongst other derivatives.
Failed NC development is associated with a large number of conditions known as Neurocristopathies, which
include common orofacial clefts, aggressive cancers and rare syndromes. The long term goal of this research
program is to advance our understanding of the earliest signaling events responsible for the formation of the NC.
Currently signaling by WNT, FGF and BMP are amongst a few of key inputs recognized to be critical for the
formation of NC, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which they execute their effects remain
limited. To improve our knowledge of this events, it is critical to identify the effectors modulated by these pathways
and to characterize their effects. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) to establish and characterize for the
first time the role of TGFb /SMAD2-SMAD3 signaling during early facets of NC formation, prior to their allocation
into the neural tube, migration or differentiation; and 2) to identify the effectors of the WNT and/or TGFb and
characterize their role during early NC formation. Our Hypotheses are that the TGFb /SMAD2-SMAD3 signaling
is required to launch the earliest events in NC formation, and that a combination of TGFb and WNT responsive
molecules direct the specific acquisition of the NC lineage. To address these hypotheses our proposal is guided
by 3 specific aims: 1) to demonstrate the requirement and contribution of the TGFb /SMAD2-SMAD3 signaling
during early facets of NC formation, 2) to identify novel candidate effectors of WNT and/or TGFb and characterize
their specific contributions to the acquisition of the NC fate, and 3) to assess their function in vivo in a vertebrate
embryo. This innovative proposal takes advantage of a robust model of human NC formation based in
pluripotent stem cells and classic chick embryology to, for the first time address the possible contribution of
TGFb signaling (not BMPs) during this process and pursues an integrative approach addressing the
combinatorial signaling of WNT and TGFb. The proposal is significant because the gains in this area will have
impact in key aspects of fate acquisition and differentiation applicable to other cell types, and should improve our
capacity to manage the many pathologies associated with NC."

Just as the function of metazoan tissues and organs is mediated by the patterned assembly of phenotypically
distinct cells during development, the functions of oral microbes in promoting health and disease arise from the
emergent properties of their patterned structure: the biofilm. For example, the accumulation of supragingival
dental plaque into stable, long-range biofilms at the gingival margin is implicated in reversible gingivitis, which
may progress to chronic periodontitis. Recent studies have called into question the relative contribution of two
conspicuous, filamentous organisms in structuring supragingival plaque over long distances: Fusobacterium
nucleatum and Corynebacterium matruchotii. There exists a critical need to understand the role that
filamentous organisms play in biofilm assembly because it is well understood that changes in taxonomic
abundance, ecological succession and biofilm structure mediate the transition from health to inflammatory
periodontal diseases in the mouth. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed an in vitro oral biofilm
model, amenable to systems imaging in which to study the molecular basis of long-range community structure
and biochemical interaction. We will elucidate the role of micron-scale spatial structure in oral biofilm assembly,
growth and function, through combined metagenomic sequencing and systems imaging of biofilms inoculated
with dental plaque from healthy donors. We will further map novel Corynebacterium genes involved in long
range spatial structure of biofilms, through co-culture RNA-seq and mRNA FISH imaging. We will next
decipher the specific F. nucleatum molecular components that underly long-range biofilm structure, through
targeted inhibition of F. nucleatum outer membrane proteins with neutralizing antibodies and through genetic
complementation of these proteins in E. coli cells co-cultured with dental plaque inocula. The knowledge
gained from the research proposed here will comprise a holistic understanding of oral community assembly
processes and physical structure across spatial scales from molecule to microbiome and may identify new
paradigms for intervening in the progression of dental plaque-mediated diseases."

 Proposed is a five-year research career development plan focused on evaluating the mechanisms of
thyroid autoimmunity during cancer immunotherapy. The candidate, Dr. Melissa G. Lechner, M.D., Ph.D., is an
Assistant Professor of Medicine in Endocrinology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This
proposal builds upon her strong background and provides new training in mouse models of autoimmunity,
advanced transcriptomic and proteomic techniques, and bioinformatics. During the award term, Dr. Lechner will
be mentored by Dr. Maureen Su, M.D., a leader in the field of autoimmune disease and experienced physician
scientist with a track record of mentoring more than 30 students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty. She
will have additional support from co-mentor Dr. Greg Brent, M.D., a renowned thyroid researcher, and a strong
team of advisors with technical and content expertise.
 Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but their use is limited
by the development of unwanted autoimmune side effects seen in up to 60% of patients. These immune-related
adverse events (IrAE) interrupt cancer treatment and lead to organ dysfunction, hospitalization, and even death.
The cause of IrAEs remains unknown, however, recent data suggest that toxicity can be uncoupled from anti-
tumor effects. Thyroiditis, a common IrAE, is ideal for studying mechanisms of IrAE development because of the
ability to directly sample immune infiltrates in the thyroid by fine needle biopsy and to compare with Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis (HT), a well-described spontaneous thyroid autoimmune disease. Interestingly, ICI-thyroiditis has both
similar and distinct features from HT. Dr. Lechner developed a mouse model that recapitulates human IrAEs
from checkpoint immunotherapy, including multi-organ immune infiltrates and autoantibodies. Using this model,
she has identified a role for RORg+ Th17 and Tc17 cells and T peripheral helper (TPH, CXCR5-ICOS+PD1+) cells
in IrAEs. These cell populations have previously been associated with spontaneous autoimmune diseases,
including HT, but not yet IrAE. Additionally, studies in patients with checkpoint-inhibitor thyroiditis showed
intrathyroidal T cell accumulation and increased RORg+ T cells. Therefore, in Specific Aim 1, Dr. Lechner will
determine the role of RORg+ Th17 and Tc17 and TPH cells in IrAE development using a mouse model and analysis
of thyroid-infiltrating cells patients with ICI-thyroiditis vs. HT. The absence of autoantibodies to known thyroid
antigens (e.g. thyroid peroxidase thyroglobulin) in many ICI-thyroiditis patients also suggests immune attack
against yet unidentified targets. Thus, in Specific Aim 2, Dr. Lechner will identify the antigen targets in ICI
thyroiditis, evaluate immune responses to these antigens, and compare them known antigens in HT. With this
work, Dr. Lechner aims to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying thyroid autoimmune disease
and checkpoint immunotherapy toxicities, and obtain the skills needed to become an independent investigator."

through childhood with emphasis on the impact of in utero substance exposure on outcome.
 At the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the University of Alabama (UA) we will enroll pregnant
women during their second trimester and follow their infants with a comprehensive multimodal data longitudinal
study. Strengths to UAB include the Comprehensive Addiction in Pregnancy Program (CAPP) that provides
prenatal care and support to pregnant women with history of substance use. UAB OB supports several prenatal
clinics within Jefferson and Blount County Departments of Health, neighborhood health centers, and the
Complications clinic. UAB is actively enrolling participants for the HEAL Outcomes of Babies with Opioid
exposure and the ACT NOW Weaning study. UAB is a site for the NICHD Maternal Fetal Medicine Network and
the NICHD Neonatal Research Network for >25 years, with long-standing, well-established and highly productive
collaborations with other centers. UA operates at the University Medical Center in Tuscaloosa that serves the
majority of the Medicaid recipients in the region as well as rural clinics in surrounding counties, including those
in the Alabama Black Belt. The UA team has expertise in neuroimaging, EEG, rural health, maternal health and
child development. Therefore, there is demonstrated adequacy of clinical, research, administrative and facilities
to accomplish this project. We clearly express our intent to participate in a cooperative manner with the other
research sites, the HDCC, HCAC, the NIH Program Scientist and the NIH Program Official in all aspects of
research in a manner consistent with the terms of the award.
Specific Aims: 1. Determine typical neurodevelopmental trajectories and typical range of variability of brain
development from birth through childhood in a diverse population. 2. Determine how early life exposure to
opioids, other substances, and other adverse environmental circumstances affect these trajectories. 3.
Determine how genetic influences interact with environmental factors to influence neurodevelopment.
Design: 300 mother/child dyads (100 with and 200 without history of drug exposure) with complete longitudinal
brain, behavioral and biological assessment in conjunction with other research sites within the HEAL Initiative."

There is an epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Central America, and the prevalence has been
increasing over the past 20 years. El Salvador and Nicaragua have the highest overall mortality rates from kidney
disease in the world, and CKD is the second leading cause of mortality among men of working age. In the US
and Europe, CKD is common in older populations (age>60), affects men and women equally, and is primarily
due to diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, CKD in certain regions of Central America disproportionately
affects younger men and appears to be unrelated to diabetes or hypertension. Agricultural workers are the most
affected, but the specific cause(s) remains unknown. Similar epidemics of chronic kidney disease of unknown
etiology (CKDu) exist in Sri Lanka and India. The US National Institutes of Health is establishing a research
consortium that will bring together a broad range of expertise and enable discovery science to understand the
cause or causes of CKDu and disease progression. The Consortium will also work to identify potential therapeutic
targets and public health intervention and will consist of a Scientific Data Coordinating Center, Field
Epidemiology Sites, and a Renal Science Core. The Consortium will work together to finalize ethical

Our aims are: (1) Develop study protocol with the CURE Consortium Steering Committee and SDCC to conduct
longitudinal research on the causes and progression of CKDu; (2) Engage and consent up to 880 Salvadoran
and Nicaraguan participants residing in well-documented high-risk CKDu communities into the CURE
Consortium; (3) Conduct clinical assessments, collect biological and environmental samples, and administer

longitudinally for three years; (4) Engage in multi-directional and sustained communication among investigators
and stakeholders locally and internationally, including communicating individual kidney function results to CURE
participants, and overall study results to cohort participants, local partners, the scientific community, public health
officials, and the general public. Our study team currently has a strong history together on this topic.

Chronic kidney disease is estimated to be the 12th leading cause of death globally, with “hot spots” of kidney
disease with no known causes. Our study of a high-risk population affected by chronic kidney disease in Central
America (kidney disease “hot spots”) will contribute to scientific understanding of environmental contributors of
disease susceptibility and severity with a particular focus on opportunities for prevention and treatment."

Increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia is a significant clinical complication of pulmonary viral
infections. The characterization of molecular players that leave immunological scars/memory for sustained
periods after clinical recovery from viral infections is vital for preventing secondary pneumonic infections. Our
current knowledge in this regard is vastly limited, and the studies so far have mainly focused on “immunologically
tolerized” dendritic cells and macrophages developing as a result of immunosuppressive microenvironment
established upon resolution of primary infection. In this application, based on our strong supportive data
(communicated to Nature Immunology) showing that IFNγ produced during pulmonary influenza infection
imprints an immunological memory in alveolar macrophages (AMs) that drive a pathologic innate memory
response to a subsequent bacterial pathogen, we propose to identify the novel mechanism of transcriptional
reprogramming in these immunologically trained AMs. In this regard, pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at
the transcriptional start site of most mammalian genes and its release onto the gene body for rapid transcription
upon cellular activation is a key step in determination of transcriptional activation. By using state-of-the art
genome-wide techniques, we have found that IFNγ responsive genes in macrophages acquire Pol II enrichment
at the promotor-proximal regions during their transcriptional induction phase that controls simultaneous
elongation and subsequent gene expression. We termed this novel mechanism Acquired Promoter-proximal Pol
II enrichment (APPe), and propose that APPe is responsible for IFN-induced memory phenotype in influenza
infection. Further, we found that chromatin modifier Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) is involved in
IFN-induced memory response by establishing APPe early in trained-macrophages. Based on these data, we
will determine: (Aim 1) how PRMT8 controls IFN-induced memory transcriptional reprogramming responsible for
an earlier and greater transcription of IFN-responsive genes in these trained AMs upon reactivation during
secondary bacterial infection, and whether PRMT8 deficiency ameliorates pathology and reinstates an
appropriate immune response to secondary bacterial infection by both Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae)
and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae/ pneumococcus); (Aim 2)
how transcriptional memory outcomes in AMs during secondary bacterial pneumonia are regulated through the
rate-liming step of APPe via PRMT8 mediated APPe occurrence for an early, uncontrolled transcription of target
genes that are involved in cytokine storm and later severe sepsis. The successful completion of proposed work
will address a major gap in our knowledge of mechanisms dictating macrophage functions during influenza and
subsequent bacterial infections, which will have implications for future therapeutic measures."

10868461,"Quality of life problems and functional deficits after cancer diagnosis are particularly acute for low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority cancer survivors. Physical activity has been shown to remediate many problems experienced by survivors and has been shown to reduce fatigue and psychological distress and improve physical functioning and quality of life. Observational data indicate that survivors who are more physically active have lower cancer-related mortality. Yet most cancer survivors do not exercise at recommended levels, and little is known about how to increase physical activity among cancer survivors in persistent poverty areas. Considerable physical activity barriers exist in persistent poverty neighborhoods, such as lack of facilities for leisure-time physical activity, few/poor quality sidewalks and parks, and concerns about neighborhood safety. Active Living After Cancer (ALAC) is an evidence-based physical activity program, adapted for minority and medically underserved survivors, that teaches participants behavioral and cognitive skills to increase physical activity. However, it is focused primarily on individual behavior change. The proposed project will incorporate community-level interventions into the ALAC program before implementing it in Acres Homes, a historically Black, persistent poverty community in Houston, Texas. We propose to leverage Be Well Acres Homes, a place-based cancer prevention initiative, to develop a multi-level intervention using health promotion interweaving. The community resources and programs developed in Be Well Acres Homes will enable connection/navigation to resources as participants develop the skills for increasing their physical activity and will foster sustainable community supports beyond the completion of participation in the ALAC program. The adaptations in ALAC will interweave the intervention with the informational environment (through enhanced communication strategies to recruit potential participants and exposure to cancer prevention educational messages provided by Be Well Acres Homes), social/cultural/organizational environment (creating a network of cancer survivors in a single neighborhood, connecting survivors with other groups/programs, e.g., walking clubs, fitness classes, community gardens), and the physical environment (connecting survivors with environmental supports for activity, e.g., park improvements) of the Acres Homes community. Using a wait-list control design we will evaluate the effect of the adapted ALAC intervention on cancer survivors’ physical functioning, quality of life. Additionally, using outcome measures based on the RE-AIM framework we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, and implementation of the ALAC program and investigate poverty-related moderators of program effectiveness and engagement to identify further program adaptations needed for survivors in persistent poverty communities."

Understanding the genetic basis of human disease requires a comprehensive assessment of the full spectrum
of human genetic variation. While the majority of structural variation can now be routinely discovered by
application of long reads and phased genome assembly, inversions have proven more difficult to characterize
due to their association with repetitive DNA and their location/structure in the genome. These represent some
of the largest forms of naturally occurring human genetic variation but are the least understood. That is
because these loci are preferentially associated with gaps and are frequently subject to the highest frequency
of recurrent mutation making them difficult to genotype using standard approaches. In this competing renewal,
we focus on the complete sequence resolution of inversion hotspots of structural variation flanked by multi-
copy segmental duplications. We apply long-read high-fidelity sequencing, ultra-long-read sequencing, and
Strand-seq data to fully phase and assemble all inversion polymorphisms and flanking sequence for 120
human genomes (Aim 1). We use the associated haplotype data to develop methods to identify inversions
associated with recurrent mutation and then test whether recurrent mutations are preferentially associated with
altered structural configurations of flanking segmental duplications by genotyping these variants in a diversity
panel of 3,200 human genomes where short-read whole-genome sequence data are available (Aim 2). Finally,
we use the sequence-resolved haplotype structures coupled to long-read sequencing of patients to delineate
breakpoints of rearrangements identified in 125 individuals harboring de novo large-scale deletions or
duplications (Aim 3). This aim will test whether certain structural configurations are predisposed to recurrent
rearrangement and improve breakpoint mapping associated with de novo rearrangement events. New
sequence-based methods will also be developed to characterize more complex forms of human genetic
variation and provide fundamental insight into their diversity, mechanism of origin, and mutational properties.
This research has the additional benefit that it will improve genome assembly, characterize a large class of
missing genetic variation, and provide us with the ability to more systematically explore this form of human
genetic variation as part of future disease-association studies."

 This translational project will focus on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a unique disease model
of inflammation and thrombosis. SLE is a complex autoimmune disease. The prevalence of SLE ranges
from 20 to 150 cases per 100,000 population. SLE affects primarily women and there is a significant impact
of health disparities in patients with Lupus. SLE is 2-3 times more prevalent among African American and
Hispanic than among Caucasian women. Patients with SLE can experience significant symptoms, such as
chronic pain, extreme fatigue, hair loss, cognitive issues, and physical impairments that affect every facet
of their lives. Many suffer from cardiovascular disease, strokes, disfiguring rashes, and painful arthritis.
The 10-year survival rate is about 70%. Historically, SLE has been considered as an adaptive immune
system disorder characterized by the presence in patient serum of autoantibodies raised against nuclear
components which deposit in blood vessels, skin, kidney, lung, joints and brain causing tissue damage
and clinical manifestations. New advances in the understanding of SLE pathogenesis have focused on the
innate immune system, with a particular focus on leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils, monocytes) as key players
in perpetuating and amplifying this systemic disease. Currently, there is no prevention or cure for SLE, and
the mainstay of treatment is non-specific immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents. Thus, there is
significant unmet clinical need in SLE and compelling demand for more effective therapeutic approaches.
Leukocyte-platelet interactions induce bidirectional signals that amplify pro-inflammatory and pro-
thrombotic cellular responses. We have focused on the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2), identifying this
adhesive receptor as a critical molecular determinant of leukocyte recruitment and signaling. Our
laboratory first reported the interaction between Mac-1 and its platelet counter-receptor GPIbα and
determined the molecular basis of GPIb recognition. We established that Mac-1:GPIbα broadly regulates
inflammation in models of vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and multiple sclerosis as well as arterial
thrombosis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the Mac-1:GPIbα interaction is broadly required
for inflammation and initiates pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic signals that promote diverse disease
processes. The specific aims of the project are: 1) To determine the effect of disrupting Mac-1:GPIbα on
the progression and complications of SLE using mouse models; 2) To define the physical determinants of
Mac-1:GPIbα binding and the nature of “outside-in” signals generated by this interaction; and 3) To provide
evidence that clinical SLE disease activity is correlated with biomarkers of the Mac-1:GPIbα interaction.
Because leukocyte-platelet interactions broadly regulate inflammation and thrombosis, understanding the
molecular machinery of this cellular complex will provide important insights for developing new therapies
directed at reducing end-organ damage in SLE and other inflammatory/thrombotic disorders."

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have revolutionized our understanding of biology at cell level. Spatial
transcriptomics further moves the field forward by providing spatial context of gene expression. These exciting
techniques have been applied in many basic science or clinical research projects to understand living systems
or the biological basis for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The data generated by scRNA-seq or
spatial transcriptomics typically has high dimension (the number of genes) and large sample size (the number
of cells or spatial spots). Many biological processes underlying the observed gene expression data are likely
non-linear functions of high dimensional gene expression data. Large sample size combined with non-linear
signals of high dimensional data makes deep learning an appropriate tool to analyze scRNA-seq or spatial
transcriptomics data. Earlier deep learning works on scRNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics focus on un-
supervised tasks, such as de-noising or clustering. For many biomedical applications, a natural next step is
supervised analysis, e.g., comparing scRNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics between two conditions. There are
much fewer works in this direction where deep learning methods face two general challenges: interpretability
and noisy labels of single cells. In this project, we aim to address the interpretability challenge by a flexible
method to incorporate gene annotation into deep learning. To work with single cells with noisy labels, we
propose a mixture model that iteratively refines cell labels and the neural network that predicts cell labels. Our
work on spatial transcriptomics focuses on using these data to train deep learning models to interpret
histological images, particularly H&E stained histological images. Our method provides spatial annotation of
histological images in terms of cell type proportions and interactions between any two cell types. Histological
images are universally available in many clinical settings. In contrast, spatial transcriptomics is harder to scale
due to cost and logistic challenges. Our method enables the transfer of knowledge from spatial transcriptomics
to histological images. Once trained by an appropriate training dataset with both spatial transcriptomics and
histological images, our method can be applied to analyze datasets with only histological images and assess
their associations with phenotypic or clinical outcomes. In summary, our computation methods address
fundamental questions on scRNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics data analysis and they are applicable for most
basic science or clinical research projects that produce relevant data."
10865110,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
There has been little advancement in overall survival for patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
(MPNST), despite decades of research and many clinical trials, and thus novel therapies are needed. While loss
of NF1 GTPase-activating protein function suggests that targeting RAS may be a logical therapeutic approach,
there is currently no approved drug that effectively and directly targets wild-type RAS. The design of novel
therapeutic combinations requires a deep understanding of the signaling pathways regulated by hyperactive
RAS and feedback that conditions the response to their inhibition. MEK, SHP2, and CDK4/6 are critical nodes
in RAS effector signaling in MPNST tumors, and combinations of small molecule inhibitors that target them may
have synergistic anti-tumor activity. Further, adaptive signaling changes in response to RAS effector pathway
inhibition occurs not only in tumor cells but also in cells that comprise the tumor immune micro-
environment (TIME). Thus, the characterization of the TIME in our murine model of MPNST, and its modulation
via small-molecule inhibitors of the RAS pathway, will identify key immune pathways leading to the
reprogramming of intratumoral myeloid cells, enhancing endogenous immune responses.
We propose three Aims: 1. Identify and functionally validate mechanisms of acquired resistance to SHP2
inhibitors in MPNST in order to develop novel therapeutic combinations. We will determine how tumors become
resistant to SHP2i, as well as to SHP2i +CDK4/6i in combination, and will perform genetic manipulation studies
in order to functionally validate priority hits. 2. Determine the efficacy and tolerability of combination small-
molecule inhibitors of RAS signaling, particularly SHP2i + CDK4/6i, in in vitro, patient-derived xenografts (PDX),
and immune-competent syngeneic Nf1 -/-/Ink4a/Arf -/- mouse models. We will test the effects of SHP2i and
CDK4/6i single agents or combinations as tools to probe the biochemical and biological changes that occur upon
pathway perturbation, and will determine the mechanism and anti-tumor activity of these combinations, with a
priority focus on the SHP2i+CDK4/6i combination, based on our advanced preliminary data. 3. Reprogram the
intratumoral pathological myeloid cells via treatment with the combination of SHP2i and CDK4/6i in murine
MPNST. Our preliminary data suggest that the landscape of MPNST is densely populated by tumor infiltrating
myeloid cells. To evaluate the effects of these agents and their combinations on the TIME, we will utilize single
cell transcriptional analysis, multiparameter flow cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry to decipher the
specific effects of these drugs on cell types that comprise the tumor, including both immune-infiltrating and
primary tumor cells. By determining the efficacy and mechanism of these rationally-designed therapeutic
strategies in both PDX and immune-competent mouse models, our studies will provide mechanism-based,
promising combinatorial approaches that may be rapidly and successfully translated to the clinic, and will inform
effective patient selection strategies and the development of novel clinical trials for patients with MPNST."

This multiple-PI application proposes investigations of cellular and molecular mechanisms of Fibrolamellar
Hepatocellular Carcinoma, FLC. FLC is a disease that occurs in children, adolescents and in young adults
without a history of other liver disorders such as fibrosis or cirrhosis. Numerous studies in FLC patients and in
animal models clearly showed that FLC is caused by a fusion protein kinase DNAJB1-PKAc which is sufficient
to induce liver cancer resembling FLC in mouse models. We found that the fusion kinase DNAJB1-PKAc
phosphorylates b-catenin at Ser675 in FLC patients and in FLC-derived spheroid cells. This phosphorylation
leads to elevation of the b-catenin-TCF4 complex which might activate multiple cancer genes via two pathways:
interaction with and activation of unique chromosomal regions (Cancer-Enhancing Genomic Regions or
Aggressive Liver Cancer Domains, CEGRs/ALCDs) and via direct activation of the promoters of genes involved
in metabolic rewiring. The main hypothesis of this application is that the DNAJB1-PKAc-b-catenin axis is a critical
mediator of FLC pathology via activation of CEGRs/ALCDs-dependent neuronal genes, oncogenes and
collagens as well as genes involved in pathological metabolic changes. Three Specific Aims are designed to test
this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will examine the role of the DNAJB1-PKAc-b-catenin pathway in activation of
CEGRs/ALCDs-dependent cancer genes in FLC. The focus of these studies is on the FLC patients who have
relapsed tumor and lung metastases which are potentially caused by activation of DNAJB1-PKAc-b-catenin-
dependent neuronal pathways. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the role of the DNAJB1-PKAc-b-catenin-TCF4
axis in FLC using a mouse model of FLC. We have generated an FLC mouse model, in which DNAJB1-PKAc
protein is created and expressed at high levels at 4 months after injections of gRNAs. We will examine
development of pathological changes in the liver and investigate the DNAJB1-PKAc-b-catenin-TCF4 pathway at
different stages of FLC. We will inhibit b-catenin by PRI-724 in the FLC mouse model, examine development of
FLC, and determine downstream molecular mediators. Specific Am 3 will determine the role of the DNAJB1-
PKAc-b-catenin-TCF4 axis in rewiring of metabolic pathways in FLC. Our preliminary data suggest that the urea
cycle and associated metabolic processes are rewired toward increased collagen synthesis and maturation in
FLC, and the treatment of FLC spheroids with PRI-724 reverts these changes. Therefore, we will test the
hypothesis that the DNAJB1-PKAc-β-catenin-TCF4 axis is a critical event for metabolic rewiring and will also
determine the impact of metabolic rewiring on FLC proliferation and survival. Thus, this project will elucidate
mechanisms of FLC and develop a background for b-catenin-based therapy."

 Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease that features the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells
resulting in insulin deﬁciency and daily insulin injections for survival. Early identiﬁcation of type 1 diabetes can
be achieved by continuously monitoring islet autoantibody status and longitudinal markers that measure the
immunological and metabolic functions. The goal of this proposal is to develop a statistical model that can
give dynamic predictions about type 1 diabetes risk based on autoantibody status and the historical data of an
individual. A longitudinal model for characterizing time-varying risk factors, a multistate model for predicting
autoantibody status, and a survival model for predicting disease progression will be combined in a joint model
to achieve the goal. The model will be applied to a dataset derived from The Environmental Determinants of
Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. It may be challenging to develop a model with such a complex structure.
However, the advances in statistical methodology and computational technology have opened up opportunities
to resolve the problems. In Aim 1, we will formulate the proposed joint model and apply it to the TEDDY data.
Statistical inferences can be made to investigate how the changes in diabetes-related antoantibodies and other
longitudinal risk factors are associated with the risk for type 1 diabetes diagnosis. In Aim 2, based on the
proposed joint model, a dynamic prediction algorithm will be derived that predicts autoantibody development
and the subsequent risk of type 1 diabetes given the historical data of an individual. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
evaluate the accuracy of the proposed dynamic prediction algorithm using a variety of diagnostic measures.
We expect that the proposed joint model will demonstrate better performance than the conventional static
survival models that use baseline characteristics or last available measurements. The proposed research can
answer critical research questions about the natural history of type 1 diabetes and the relationship between
longitudinal risk factors."
10873821,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 During development, specific synaptic partners connect in order to ensure proper neural circuit function,
but how these connections are disassembled during neurodegeneration is less well understood. In rodent
experimental glaucoma (EG) models, synapse loss occurs early, preceding retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite
retraction and cell death. Converging evidence in rodents suggests that specific RGC types are more susceptible
to elevated intraocular pressure, but little is known about retinal circuit disassembly in glaucomatous primate
retina. Indeed, significant differences in mice, which lack a lamina cribrosa and macula and have dissimilar RGC
types, limit the translation and generalizability of findings to humans. It is critically important to address this
knowledge gap in order to advance successful development of clinically relevant diagnostics and novel treatment
approaches, such as neuroprotection, gene therapy, and cell-based vision restoration strategies. Here we
assemble a highly collaborative team of investigators with complementary expertise well-matched to our goal
of systematically determining the connectivity, function, and transcriptomes of RGCs undergoing circuit
and synapse disassembly in glaucomatous primate retina. Our approach builds on a well-established rhesus
macaque non-human primate (NHP) model of experimental glaucoma that closely recapitulates structural and
functional changes observed in human glaucoma, and permits detailed and precise staging of disease. Based
on our studies in mice and preliminary data in NHP, we hypothesize that specific microcircuits in the injured
adult NHP retina may exhibit susceptibility in connectivity and function, which is reflected in differential
gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we apply rigorous quantitative electrophysiological, anatomical, and
molecular assessments focusing on the four main RGC types in NHP retina: ON and OFF midget and parasol
ganglion cells. Aim 1 will use high-density multielectrode arrays, single cell recordings, and Patch-seq to identify
the functional RGC types that are vulnerable in NHP EG and probe their transcriptomes to reveal mechanistic
insights and novel therapeutic targets. Aim 2 will determine the specificity and patterns of circuit and synapse
disassembly in NHP EG from both lamina-specific and cell type-specific perspectives using detailed circuit and
synapse mapping. The proposal is innovative because it brings together multi-modal function, morphologic, and
molecular analyses, and is significant because it focuses on the four main RGC types in primate that account for
the majority of human vision and are affected in glaucoma. We will generate significant resources for the scientific
community and reveal insights into retinal circuit disassembly and the potential for circuit repair in a highly
clinically relevant model of glaucoma."
10906666,"Background:
Among newly initiated Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) patients, same day access to PC-MHI
from primary care or other select medical clinics (e.g., emergency department/urgent care) is a Veterans
Health Administration (VA) Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) performance measure
(mnemonic: pcmhi7). Prompt initiation of mental health care after a medical visit increases the likelihood of
subsequent mental health follow-up visits, enhancing quality of care. Yet, despite the rapid VA virtual care
expansion during COVID-19, factors that influence virtual same day access to PC-MHI are unknown.
Significance:
Preliminary studies from this research group found that in a large VA medical center, PC-MHI same day
access rates were nearly twice as high for in-person visits compared to virtual visits. Accordingly, PC-MHI
patients who initiate care virtually may experience poorer medical and mental health outcomes from loss to
follow-up. This finding reflects a knowledge gap that exists across disciplines in both VA and non-VA settings
regarding effective strategies for virtual care coordination. The proposed study addresses multiple HSR&D
Priority Areas: Access to Care, Mental Health, Primary Care Practice, Virtual Care/Telehealth.
Innovation & Impact:
The proposed research would be the first to characterize factors that influence same day access to PC-MHI
among patients who use virtual care to initiate mental health services, including mutable clinic characteristics
that may be amenable to intervention.
By identifying specific predictors of same day access to PC-MHI from primary care, the proposed study will
advance understanding of factors that affect virtual same day access while also identifying specific targets for
future interventions, improving quality of care, and relatedly, medical and mental health outcomes, for
Veterans who seek PC-MHI care virtually. Moreover, the study will advance scientific knowledge by providing
data to inform strategies for effective interdisciplinary virtual care coordination.
Specific Aims:
1) Identify multi-level characteristics associated with virtual and in-person PC-MHI same day access in
a national VA sample.
2) Assess barriers, facilitators, and strategies for successful virtual care coordination in PC-MHI.
Methodology:
The study will use a mixed methods design. For Aim 1 (Quantitative), a national cohort of Veterans who
initiated PC-MHI mental health services during FY2019 − FY2021 will be identified. PC-MHI same day access
will be determined based on the presence or absence of a primary care or other select medical clinic visit on
the same day as the initial PC-MHI appointment, per the Mental Health SAIL definition. A multi-level
generalized linear model will be used to evaluate predictors of virtual and in-person same day access. For Aim
2 (Qualitative), semi-structured qualitative interviews with PC-MHI mental health providers and primary care
providers from two VA healthcare systems (one urban, one rural) will be conducted to identify barriers,
facilitators, and strategies for virtual care coordination in PC-MHI.
Next Steps/Implementation:
In partnership with the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the Office of Connected Care, and the
Office of Primary Care, the findings will be applied toward an HSR&D Merit Review Award grant proposal to
develop an intervention to improve virtual care coordination in PC-MHI."
10904649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Orofacial clefts involving the lip and palate are the most common congenital craniofacial malformation that occur
as part of >400 syndromes or as an isolated phenotype in ~1/700 live-births. Non-syndromic cleft palate only by
itself afflicts 1/1700 children with a 2:1 increased incidence in females. The lifetime cost for medical treatment,
educational services, and lost productivity averages more than $100,000 per affected person. Embryonic
palatogenesis involves bilateral vertical outgrowth of shelves from the maxilla that elevate horizontally and fuse
above the tongue. While palatogenesis has been studied for more than a century, it is not clear how palatal
shelves reorient from the vertical to horizontal direction during elevation. One reason for this knowledge gap is
that this process is rapid and therefore hard to time and capture. Another is a lack of methodologies to assess
palate elevation and of mouse models with a well-characterized palate elevation delay. Our studies show that
palatal shelves elevate in less than 3 hours in utero and that there is a defined embryonic window of time for
elevation. We have also assessed the dynamic interplay of cell proliferation, cell orientation and actomyosin
contraction that underlies normal palatal shelf elevation. We have established novel methodologies to use MRI
for in utero imaging and to use finite element analysis to model palatal shelf elevation. In addition, we have been
studying the role of cytoskeletal scaffolding protein SPECC1L in palatogenesis. We identified the first de novo
autosomal dominant SPECC1L mutations in patients with orofacial clefts. We and others have now shown that
patients with SPECC1L mutations clustered in the second coil ed coil domain (CCD2) or calponin homology
domain (CHD) commonly manifest hypertelorism, cleft palate and omphalocele among other phenotypes. Using
multiple Specc1l mouse alleles, we have established that loss of SPECC1L leads to a delay in palatal shelf
elevation. Interestingly, in-frame CCD2 specific mutations (deletions, point mutations) in mice result in a more
severe palatal shelf elevation delay, indicating a gain-of-function. At the cellular level, CCD2 leads to
perinuclear mislocalization of SPECC1L along with a disruption of cytoplasmic filamentous actin and non-muscle
myosin II. Lastly, our preliminary data show that cleft palate in CCD2 mutants is rescued upon maternal folic
acid supplementation. In Aim 1, we will study the cell and tissue mechanics underlying both normal and abnormal
palate elevation in CCD2 alleles using ex vivo and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and computational
modeling. In Aim 2, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the gain-of-function in
CCD2 mutant cells using state-of-the-art proteomic analyses. In Aim 3, we will determine how maternal folate
supplementation rescues palate elevation defects in CCD2 mutants. Successful completion of these studies will
provide critical insights into tissue dynamics and cell signaling during normal and abnormal palatal shelf
elevation, as well as into the effect of maternal folic acid supplementation, which will provide targets for future
translational strategies against orofacial clefting."
10791920,"One of the eternal wars between the host and pathogens is the fight for nutritional metal ions. Bacteria have
evolved multiple pathways to achieve that, including the one mediated by a group of small molecules called
siderophores that are often critical for the virulence of the bacteria. The long-term goal is to help develop potential
molecules targeting the siderophore-mediated metal uptake process, so to treat bacterial infections. However,
one of the critical steps in this process, the substrate uptake mediated by ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) importers,
is poorly understood. The overall objective in this proposal is to address the problem by studying the detailed
molecular mechanism of a specific siderophore ABC importer from uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC): the
yersiniabactin (Ybt) importer YbtPQ. The rational is that, with detailed knowledge gained here, it will be possible
to design and optimize small molecules to specifically target YbtPQ. To accomplish the goal, two specific aims
will be pursued: 1) reconstructing its complete transport cycle by structural studies; and 2) investigating its
substrate selectivity and interaction with potential inhibitors. The multidisciplinary approach used here include
structural biology, biochemistry, biophysics, as well as microbiology. The proposal is innovative because 1)
YbtPQ is an exporter-like importer, representing a substantial departure from the established paradigm of ABC
importers; and 2) the results will provide potential inhibitors against YbtPQ that could be clinically useful in the
future. Last but not least, this study is also significant because it is expected to not only reveal novel molecular
mechanism of exporter-like importer, but also provide scientific justification for further development of drugs
against siderophore ABC importers."
10815769,"Resident-to-resident aggression (RRA) in long-term care (LTC) is associated with preventable injury, suffering,
and serious psychological distress. One in five residents in nursing homes (NH) experiences RRA in a given
month. Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at an even higher risk of RRA
due to cognitive impairment-related symptoms. However, RRA remains poorly understood. The race and
ethnicity of residents may play an important role in RRA initiation and escalation, risk/resilience factors,
consequences, and NH response systems. As NH populations are becoming increasingly racially/ethnically
diverse, focusing on the role of race/ethnicity in RRA allows for the development of a tailored prevention and
intervention to identify and address it, as many residents involved in RRA have ADRD and are unable to speak
for themselves. The goal of this equity-driven project is to systematically investigate the role of race/ethnicity in
the types, patterns, and circumstances surrounding RRA using the first prevalence cohort study of RRA, and
collecting additional stakeholder input with explicit consideration of the needs of residents with ADRD, to
develop, refine, and pilot-test a novel intervention. In Aim 1, I will leverage the first and only NIH-funded RRA
prevalence cohort study to qualitatively contextualizing and quantitatively examining the role of race/ethnicity in
RRA across individual, dyadic, and facility levels. Aim 2, I will gather input from multiple NH stakeholders to
improve understanding of the role of race/ethnicity in RRA, and to identify current and optimal intervention and
prevention strategies in residents with and without ADRD via mixed methods approach. In Aims 3a and 3b,
findings from Aim 1 and Aim 2 will be used to develop and refine a staff education intervention focused on the
role of race/ethnicity in RRA that may be integrated into an existing RRA intervention program that does not
currently have information regarding race/ethnicity. As a social scientist trained in public health research, I am
ideally positioned to spearhead this line of research, given my productive track record in social determinants of
health and elder mistreatment research. Through the award period, I will build upon my prior training to
develop new knowledge and skills in long-term care research (Aim 1; Training Objective 1); health equity
research (Aim 1; Training Objective 2); long-term care policy-making, advocacy, and leadership (Aim 2;
Training Objective 3); and behavioral intervention and implementation science (Aim 3a, 3b; Training Objective
3). Career development activities will consist of formal coursework, experiential learning and research
opportunities, and mentorship from experts in elder mistreatment, RRA research, health disparities, and
behavioral intervention development. This award will help me achieve my long-term career goal of being an
independent investigator with an impactful program of long-term care research focused on equity-driven,
evidence-based elder abuse prevention and intervention development and implementation for
racially/ethnically diverse older persons with ADRD."
10879054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The 2014 Surgeon General’s report provided clear evidence that smoking by cancer survivors causes adverse
health outcomes and the 2020 report concluded that smoking cessation after a cancer diagnosis improves
survival. Though smoking cessation improves outcomes and is advocated as a standard of care in oncology,
tobacco treatment is not consistently delivered as a part of cancer care. To address this challenge, the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) in 2017. The C3I
provides financial and technical assistance through a Coordinating Center to 52 NCI-designated cancer
centers to implement evidence-based tobacco treatment programs and integrate smoking cessation into
routine patient care in oncology settings. All funded centers were required to sustain their programs for a
minimum of three years following the NCI-funded period. However, the trajectories and determinants of
sustainability for tobacco treatment programs in these cancer centers are unknown. More broadly, achieving
sustained delivery of evidence-based programs over time has been identified as one of the most crucial yet
understudied challenges. Our long-term goal is to develop a generalizable model for sustaining evidence-
based tobacco treatment programs in cancer care. The objective of this study is to investigate the trajectories
and determinants of sustainability across evidence-based tobacco treatment programs in C3I and to identify
appropriate strategies for promoting sustainability using an implementation mapping approach (i.e.,
“sustainability mapping”). We define sustainability as the extent to which programs maintain core components,
implementation strategies, and program outcomes over time. We have demonstrated the feasibility of these
assessments in collaboration with the C3I Coordinating Center and participating cancer centers. The proposed
study will extend this collaboration and leverage the NCI’s substantial investment in the C3I to pursue the
following specific aims: 1) Characterize the sustainment of tobacco treatment programs within cancer centers;
2) Specify the relationships between multilevel determinants, strategies, and outcomes of sustainability for
tobacco treatment programs within cancer centers; and 3) Develop and test a toolkit to guide the selection of
sustainment strategies for tobacco treatment programs in cancer care. The proposed research offers an
unprecedented opportunity for identifying how investment in building evidence-based programs is converted
into sustainable healthcare systems change."

 Mental disorders that affect the hippocampus disrupt people’s ability to form one-shot memories. My goal is
to lead an independent lab, linking biological properties of hippocampal neurons to the ability to perform memory-
guided cognitive behaviors. To map cognitive behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms, my lab will
perform theoretical analyses and simulation of state-space models of cognitive behaviors, implementing these
models in a recurrent network architecture with learning rules that match biological plasticity rules (Aims 3a, c).
To precisely characterize memory-guided behaviors at real-world complexity, my lab will apply state-of-the-art
behavioral tracking techniques in natural settings to foraging behavior of wintering birds, chickadees and
sparrows (Aim 3b). As a theorist, I will actively collaborate with experimentalists, drawing on my experience
recording from the brain in animals performing cognitive tasks.
 My postdoctoral work in the Aronov lab, at Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute, focuses on neural
activity underlying a hippocampus-dependent one-shot memory behavior, food-caching, in the model system
chickadees, caching birds with extreme memory abilities. I developed new methods for recording large
populations of neurons in the chickadee hippocampus while they cache and retrieve food, and methods for
precisely tracking their caching behavior (Aim 1a). Probing the hippocampus at moments of caching, I found a
new mode of hippocampal activity patterns (Aim 1b), which is reactivated when birds return to retrieve food (Aim
1c). To compare this one-shot mode to representations of consistent environmental features, I am reproducing,
in food-caching birds, findings from rodents showing changes to place cells at consistent reward zones, and
comparing this to one-shot representations of food-caching (Aim 2a). I am developing a theoretical state-space
model that explains both one-shot and consistent representations in the hippocampus (Aim 2b), incorporating
hippocampus-inspired neural mechanisms (Aim 2c).
 Here, I outline a training plan to expand my skills and experience to lead an independent lab doing a
combination of theoretical and real-world behavioral studies. I will deepen my training in theoretical methods
working with my co-mentor Prof. Larry Abbott, and through affiliation with the Columbia Center for Theoretical
Neuroscience. My training in tracking real-world behavior will be guided by my collaborator Prof. Vladimir
Pravosudov, the leading pioneer in tracking real-world chickadee behaviors, with an extended visit to his
Cognitive and Behavioral Ecology Lab and field sites. For additional training designing and fabricating custom
equipment, I will work with Dr. Tanya Tabachnik, who heads the Advanced Instrumentation Core at ZI. This
additional training, with instrumental support from the K99/R00 award, will prepare me well, and make me a
highly competitive candidate for tenure-track faculty positions."

The purpose of the Animal and Microsurgery Core (Core B) is to establish a focused facility that provides
investigators in each of the two projects with sufficient breeding of animals with specified genotypes, and with
standardized cardiac or skin transplantation and tolerance induction procedures for the proposed experiments.
Core B will provide a key service role that will enable the Principal Investigators and their staff to focus on
experimental and scientific efforts. Centralized breeding and screening of the progeny will ensure that animals
of required genotypes are available for the proposed experiments. Transplantation performed by a centralized
source will standardize the procedures, minimize surgically imposed disparities in the grafts used by the two
projects and allow some long-term acceptors generated for Project 1 (addressing vulnerabilities to the
maintenance of transplantation tolerance) to be used for Project 2 (confronting the barrier to stable
transplantation tolerance posed by memory T cells) to minimize experimental costs. In addition, the purchase of
supplies, such as sutures, anesthetics and immunosuppressants will be done in bulk for both projects to reduce
cost. The specific tasks of Core B will be to: a) breed and genotype animals to be used for both projects; b)
transplant heart allografts as directed by the project leaders and their personnel; c) prepare and inject donor
splenocytes and administer indicated immunosuppressive therapies; d) monitor the beating of the transplanted
hearts, the health of the transplant recipients, and record times of rejection; e) sacrifice transplanted animals as
directed by the Principal Investigators and their personnel, and collect organs for histology, as well as to distribute
to other project personnel for phenotypic and functional analyses of immune cells."
10933401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently virus particles have gained immense attention for their potential as transformative therapeutic carriers.
For example, the FDA-approved biologic Luxturna is an adeno-associated virus (AAV) used to carry genetic
materials to treat hereditary blindness. In drug delivery, quality control is very important and the percentage of
empty and part-filled capsids in such a sample needs to be determined accurately to avoid possible catastrophic
effects of overdosing. While there are existing techniques like ELISA and qPCR that are used for this purpose,
blind studies have shown alarmingly high intra-sample standard deviations. We propose a simpler yet more
effective technique to discriminate AAVs depending on their cargo content – a plasmonic nanopore sensor with
automated recapture capability for electrical sensing, aligned to operate in tandem with an optical trapping
system. Viruses are soft nanoparticles and the deformability of AAV capsids depends on their cargo content. We
will implement our bimodal virus characterization platform through our three Specific Aims: (1a) Characterize
deformation dynamics of single AAVs during translocations through solid-state nanopores; (1b) Recapture each
virus after translocation and automate a recapture protocol; (2) Capture single AAVs by self-induced back-action
(SIBA) actuated nanopore electrophoresis (SANE) optical trapping in tandem with electrical recapturing; (3)
Achieve robust classification of AAVs based on their cargo load by applying machine learning to optical-electrical
signals that depend on virus deforamability during experiments. First, we will track the voltage-induced
deformability of three AAV samples of different cargo contents: filled with ssDNA (AAVssDNA), dsDNA (AAVdsDNA),
and empty capsids (AAVempty) through a range of voltages. Each type of AAV is expected to induce a unique and
reproducible change in relative translocation current versus applied voltage. A narrow voltage range that shows
the best discrimination will be applied on different percentage mixtures of AAVssDNA+AAVempty and
AAVdsDNA+AAVempty. Conditions will be optimized to get the best discrimination between cargo-filled AAVs and
the empty/part-filled capsid populations. Once this step is successful, we will incorporate single/multiple
recapture capability to the platform to gain statistically sound data per AAV particle. Next, a gold double nanohole
structure will be fabricated on top of the nanopore to optically trap AAVs by SIBA force, which will further deform
AAVs and slow down their translocation. Importantly, optical-electrical tandem sensing will allow characterization
of single AAV size deformations decoupled from charge effects. For automatic classification of viruses, we will
develop a probabilistic (Bayesian) machine learning model with multiple data segments from optical-electrical
signals of single AAVs for very high accuracy predictions. The proposed machine leanring assisted electrical-
optical sensing will detect the fraction of viral particles (e.g., the AAVdsDNA fraction) from a complex AAV mixture
while using only pico- to nano-molar concentrations, in contrast to current analytical ultracenrifugation
technologies that use up significant amounts of an AAV preparation in the quality assurance step."

The candidate, Sung Won Choi MD MS, is a physician-scientist who has developed a career in patient-oriented
research (POR). She is an active clinical pediatric oncologist who focuses on treating life-threatening blood
diseases with novel immune-based therapies, such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Despite
the potentially curative intent of HCT, its broader application has been limited by acute graft-versus host disease
(GVHD). Unfortunately, acute GVHD can negatively impact clinical and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
outcomes and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Dr. Choi’s research program has focused on designing
innovative clinical trials to mitigate acute GVHD by incorporating biological, clinical, and psychosocial correlative
studies and leveraging modern mobile health technologies to further enhance care delivery. Thus, her research
program provides a unique training opportunity for early stage investigators interested in POR, which is
complemented by the following outstanding resources at the University of Michigan: (1) NHLBI T32 Training
Grant in Hematology (T32 HL007622); (2) Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) | Clinical
and Translational Science Award (UL1TR002240); (3) Clinical Trials Support Unit; and (4) School of Public
Health. This ideal training environment will allow young, clinical investigators to develop and gain new skills in
clinical trials design, qualitative and quantitative research methods, communication and presentation skills,
manuscript and grant writing, professional growth, individual development plans, team science projects, ethical
conduct of research, and protection of human subjects. Indeed, this rich environment has influenced Dr. Choi’s
overall career goal of designing rigorous POR studies, mentoring the next generation of POR investigators, and
together with her mentees, making meaningful contributions to the clinical and HRQOL outcomes of family
caregivers and HCT patients through joint productive activity. In this application, Dr. Choi proposes didactic
courses and group discussions coupled with experiential training in her currently funded research projects: in a
phase I/II clinical trial, to test the safety and efficacy of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to prevent acute
GVHD in pediatric HCT (Aim 1); in a mobile health randomized trial, to examine the effectiveness of Roadmap
2.0, a positive psychology intervention in family caregivers of HCT patients (Aim 2). Dr. Choi will also develop
new research directions by generating preliminary data for a future, full-scale just-in-time adaptive intervention
(JITAI) to promote physical and mental HRQOL in family caregivers of HCT patients (Aim 3). This new research
direction is a logical extension of Aim 2. Thus, these projects will collectively provide Dr. Choi’s trainees with
unique experiences in: i) multidisciplinary team science; ii) designing, conducting, and analyzing pharmaceutical
and non-pharmaceutical (social and behavioral) interventions; iii) early phase clinical trial design and randomized
controlled trial design; and iii) and generating new research ideas as well as preliminary data for future grant
applications. Dr. Choi will expand her mentoring activities and build core knowledge in professional development."
10911921,"SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. The frontline treatment for advanced
prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which has been the standard of care for ~80 years. Recent
practice-changing data have demonstrated a survival benefit when ADT is intensified, but the treatment choice
for intensification is unclear. Regardless, metastatic disease almost always progresses as castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). A major limitation of new CRPC treatments is that patients are selected based on prior
therapies instead of their genetics and disease-driving molecular processes. Essential findings from our previous
project period include clear and reproducible clinical evidence that an “adrenal-permissive” HSD3B1(1245C)
germline variant encodes for a gain-of-function missense in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1),
the rate-limiting steroidogenic enzyme for synthesis of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from extragonadal
precursor steroids. This adrenal-permissive HSD3B1 is a genetic and metabolic driver of hormone therapy
resistance. In this renewal application, we propose to determine the mechanisms and clinical significance of
inheritance of the HSD3B1(1245C) variant and move toward its use as a biomarker to tailor castration-
resistant and castration-sensitive prostate cancer treatment to the individual patient's genetics and tumor
biology. We hypothesize that the germline HSD3B1(1245C) variant is a predictive biomarker that will allow us
to identify patients who will benefit from upfront adrenal androgen ablation. Our preliminary data indicate that
BMX inhibition of 3βHSD1 phosphorylation will be therapeutic – direct therapeutic inhibition of 3βHSD1 for
men with the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1 should reverse the adverse biology and clinical outcomes conferred by
extragonadal androgen biosynthesis in CRPC. Our data also indicate that after intensified hormonal therapy,
HSD3B1 inheritance is a determinant of systemic metabolic effects, including adverse effects seen in some men,
but not others. The potential clinical consequences of the concepts we propose are profound because they
couple a germline disease-driving metabolic driver to therapeutic mechanisms for reversal of poor outcomes.
Aim 1: Determine whether inheritance of the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) allele is a predictive
biomarker of improved benefit from adding abiraterone to ADT for non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate
cancer. We will analyze germline DNA available from 959 men enrolled in the STAMPEDE trial. Aim 2: Define
the role of phosphorylation in 3βHSD1 activation and determine the role of BMX in the conversion of DHEA to
downstream potent androgens. We will determine if the BMX kinase is essential for 3βHSD1 phosphorylation
and cellular activation and test its efficacy in a proof-of-concept clinical trial. Aim 3: Determine the mechanistic
link between HSD3B1 inheritance and circulating metabolites in men undergoing intensive hormonal therapy.
The mechanisms that regulate these circulating metabolites are most likely a function of hepatic metabolism, so
we will test whether the effects of HSD3B1 genotype occur via sex steroid signaling or bile acid signaling."
10846624,"ABSTRACT
Background: The global pandemic brought on by SARS-CoV-2 has profoundly impacted health and care for
veterans, who are generally older, sicker and more economically vulnerable than the overall U.S. population.
Veterans are likely to face lasting risks related to care disruptions. Understanding the long-term impact of these
disruptions and varied responses across VA Medical Centers (VAMC) is critical to understanding (1) primary
care needs moving forward, (2) identifying high risk patients for targeted interventions, and (3) reducing
disparities exacerbated by care disruptions.
Significance: Diabetes and hypertension are chronic conditions requiring substantial provider and patient care
to manage and result in high healthcare cost. Roughly, a quarter of all veterans receiving care at the VA have
diabetes and well over a third have hypertension. Diabetes and hypertension are associated with high
cardiovascular risk and lead to serious complications, including stroke, heart disease, kidney failure, amputation
and death. Racial, socioeconomic and geographic disparities in disease prevalence and progression are well
documented; hence, it is critical that we understand the impact of the pandemic with a particular focus on
“lessons learned” and health disparities that have widened.
Specific Aims: Our aims are (1) To determine the long-term impact of disrupted care on chronic disease
outcomes across the nation at the patient and VAMC level; (2) to identify veterans at high cardiovascular risk
as a result of disrupted care and determine the extent to which disparities with respect to race-ethnic group,
rural-urban residence and social vulnerability have widened during the pandemic; and (3) with input from our
advisory panel, create a Power BI dashboard of cardiovascular monitoring and risk to disseminate our results.
Methodology: We will create two retrospective cohorts of Veterans receiving primary care from 2017 through
2022: a diabetes and a hypertension cohort. Social vulnerability measures will be assigned at the census-tract
level based on a veterans’ residence. Our models are designed to investigate associations between individual-,
census tract- and VAMC- level factors, health care delivery metrics, and health outcomes using complex GIS
linkages and advanced spatio-temporal statistical methods. Delivery of care metrics include the extent to which
cardiovascular risk factors are monitored and their levels (when monitored) early in the pandemic. Outcomes
include prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), CVD risk levels, hospitalization, and
mortality. Aspects of our work that set it apart from ongoing projects are (1) our ability to include complete data
on inpatient hospital visits and emergency department visits when analyses are limited to South Carolina, (2)
the advanced statistical modeling that enables us to account for multiple factors at multiple levels (i.e., patient,
census tract, VAMC); and (3) the spatio-temporal aspects of the proposal which are critical given the spatio-
temporal nature of the pandemic
Next Steps/Implementation: We plan to create a dashboard in Power BI, a VA supported business intelligence
tool, that allows users to display data in visual format allowing data to inform strategic decisions. Our dashboard
will provide individualized information for each VAMC illustrating adjusted quarterly levels from 2017 through
2022 for (1) disrupted care metrics (i.e., CVD risk monitoring, primary care visits by mode), (2) levels of ASCVD,
(3) ACC ASCVD risk levels (in those without ASCVD); and (4) mortality rates. Our use of area-level data and
our focus on the VAMC level analyses will inform policy-level decision making during and following the
pandemic. Lessons learned on the relationship between changes in care delivery, VAMC-level adaptability and
chronic disease outcomes will inform post-pandemic care throughout the VA."
10846607,"Background: Veteran suicide prevention remains the top clinical priority for the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA). To mitigate Veteran suicide risk, VHA has national guidelines recommending an enhanced care package
after self-directed violence (SDV) such as creating a suicide safety plan or increasing the frequency of outpatient
mental health visits. Adherence to each given care component is considered a marker of care quality for suicide
risk (henceforth referred to as suicide-related care quality). Recent research utilizing national VHA data
suggests these care components may not be provided equitably to all Veterans. As research shows that Black,
Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Veterans experience poorer mental health care quality than white
Veterans, it is possible that similar issues may impact their suicide-related care quality. However, no research to
date has examined the quality of suicide-related care among BIPOC Veterans. Thus, further evaluation of
suicide-related care quality is needed to ensure equitable, effective care for BIPOC Veterans with SDV. The
current proposal seeks to evaluate components of suicide-related care quality among BIPOC Veterans using a
concurrent, mixed-methods triangulation approach to inform future intervention development.
Significance: The proposed project directly addresses VHA’s top clinical priority, suicide prevention. In
addition, this proposal aligns with VA HSR&D’s high priority foci of suicide prevention and health equity as well
as VHA National Strategic Plan Objectives 2.1 and 2.3 which focus on ensuring Veterans receive equitable,
comprehensive suicide prevention services to support their recovery. VHA Office of Health Equity and VHA
Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention also highlight in their strategic plans the need for supporting
equitable, suicide-related care for all Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed project is the first evaluation of suicide-related care quality among BIPOC
Veterans with SDV. In addition, no research to date has determined areas to improve suicide-related care quality
for BIPOC Veterans. Use of national VHA- and non-VHA administrative data triangulated with BIPOC Veteran
and mental health clinician qualitative data will result in a richer conceptualization of current factors impacting
suicide-related care and inform future strategies for enhancing care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1) Evaluate suicide-related care quality among BIPOC Veterans; Aim 2) Conduct qualitative
interviews with BIPOC Veterans and VA clinicians to better understand factors impacting suicide-related care
quality for BIPOC Veterans; Aim 3) Explore associations between health care systems-level factors and suicide-
related care quality indicators for BIPOC Veterans; Exploratory Aim) Explore the relationship between suicide-
related care quality among BIPOC Veterans and suicide outcomes.
Methodology: Aim 1 will identify BIPOC Veterans with SDV (FY18-FY22) utilizing VHA databases. Data from
the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse for suicide-related care quality outcomes as well as sociodemographic and
clinical variables will be linked. Data will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Aim 2 will involve
interviews with at least 40 BIPOC Veterans and at least 40 VHA mental health clinicians about their beliefs and
experiences with suicide-related care which will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Aim 3 will link data from
Aim 1 to health care systems factors at the station level. For the Exploratory Aim will link data from mortality data
sources to explore associations with mortality outcomes.
Next Steps/ Implementation: The proposed project will increase our understanding of factors impacting suicide-
related care quality among BIPOC Veterans. Findings from this project will inform future proposals focused on
intervention development to enhance suicide-related care quality among BIPOC Veterans."

 Climate change continues to result in increased exposure to wildfires in California (CA) and around the
world with smoke reaching far more populations than in recent years. There is increased concern for the health
effects of these fires, especially for pregnant people and their developing embryos/fetuses. Birth defects are
the leading cause of infant mortality in the US. In the US, 3-5% of all births, i.e., more than 100,000
babies/year, are born with a major birth defect. Few studies have been conducted to examine the relationship
between wildfire smoke and birth defects, and none have included study populations with detailed wildfire
smoke exposure metrics. None have included large population-based studies with thorough case
ascertainment.
 We propose to compile a unique group of datasets of fire occurrence, air quality monitoring and modeling,
meteorology and housing characteristics of the maternal residence during critical periods of pregnancy for
mothers of children with and without birth defects in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and
Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS) Study, observational, population-based,
case-control studies, between 2000-2018 in California. Cases had at least one of 22 major birth defects of the
heart, brain and spine, eye, ear, face and mouth, gut, or muscles and bones. Detailed residential history and
covariate data are available from extensive interviews of participants about their pregnancy experience and
general health, and medication use during pregnancy. Specifically, we aim to estimate the risk of 22 major
structural birth defects in relation to wildfire smoke exposures (fire burned area within 20 and 50km, smoke
frequencies, fire-sourced PM2.5 and ozone, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) at the maternal residence in
early pregnancy during defect-specific periods of development. Additionally, we will investigate whether the
relationship (or lack thereof) between wildfire smoke exposure and birth defects is modified by neighborhood
socioeconomic status, psychosocial stress or housing factors.
 With geocoded residential history, physician determined case ascertainment, extensive covariate
collection, housing characteristics and exhaustive air pollution and fire measurement and modeling, our study
will have the most precise exposure assessment and case ascertainment to date in a highly exposed region of
CA. The findings have the potential to inform targeted clinical and public health interventions designed to
reduce exposures to pregnant people."

The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) is a longitudinal study that follows a risk-enriched
cohort from late-midlife into old age and focuses on (1) Defining the preclinical window at the level of the
individual including the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) proteinopathy and cognitive decline prior to overt
clinical symptoms; (2) gaining a comprehensive picture of the effects of nonmodifiable genetics and modifiable
health and lifestyle factors on cognitive and AD biomarker onsets and trajectories; (3) characterizing the
presence and impact of other diseases associated with cognitive decline—chiefly vascular disease. WRAP
consists of over 1,729 (1386 active) adults who enrolled in midlife (baseline mean age 54 yrs), are followed
biannually for an average of 12 years of follow-up so far, and on whom we conduct cognitive, lifestyle, lab,
medical and biomarker assessments of AD and related disorders (ADRD). In the prior cycle we: (i) Developed
methods for identifying subtle cognitive decline utilizing each participant’s own baseline performance, thereby
improving sensitivity to decline while reducing diagnostic bias; (ii) Derived temporal information from amyloid
positron emission tomography (PET) and plasma assays showing that amyloid onset age can be estimated and
precedes tauopathy, (iii) found that when amyloid and tau proteinopathies are present, cognitive decline
accelerates; (iv) showed that lifestyle and health factors affect cognitive decline and likely impact the length of
the preclinical window; (v) showed that AD pathology/risk and aspects of vascular changes/risk independently
and jointly impact brain health and cognitive decline; (vi) included WRAP data in several multi-cohort
collaborations that have advanced the field. With these gains and new supportive preliminary data, WRAP is
uniquely positioned to address the following major aims and knowledge gaps in the next cycle: Aim 1 will derive
person-level estimates of the preclinical window defined as the interval between onset of AD proteinopathy and
the onset of cognitive decline. We will perform 3000 main WRAP study visits from which we will characterize
cognitive decline. We will assay 4,400 existing and 2,640 anticipated plasma samples for AD-related biomarkers.
Subsets undergo AD (PET and/or CSF) and vascular (MRI and ultrasound) biomarkers. PET—plasma
concordances will be established, and analyses using plasma-derived ADRD biomarkers will be conducted on
the entire cohort. Aim 2 examines relationships between key genetic and health/lifestyle predictors to cognitive
decline in the context of AD biomarkers. Aim 3 examines the inter-relationship between cerebrovascular health
spectrum and its associations with cognitive decline relative to AD proteinopathy. Overall, the questions that
WRAP is addressing with its longitudinal assessments and advanced temporal modeling are innovative and vital
to the field regarding defining preclinical AD with greater precision at the level of the individual, and determining
the factors that modify this window."

 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is common in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.
Recently, we discovered that the strongest biomarker signal was of microRNA let-7b-5p, with a 46-fold
increase (p<0.001) at birth in the blood of infants who subsequently developed severe BPD (versus
no BPD) many weeks later at 36w post-menstrual age. We also found a 14-fold increase of let-7b-5p on day
1 in the tracheal aspirate of infants who subsequently developed BPD. In cell culture, airway epithelial cells
were the primary source of let-7b-5p, that increased with hyperoxia. We found that excessive let-7b inhibits
angiogenesis, and that let-7b inhibition during hyperoxia improves lung development in newborn mice.
 In the “Let-7b in BPD” project, we will build upon our exciting discovery of let-7b-5p as a robust
biomarker of BPD, and determine its relevance to lung development and BPD. We will test the central
hypotheses that miRNA let-7b-5p is (a) a valuable biomarker for staging, monitoring disease
progression and response to therapy, (b) is released from airway epithelial cells by oxidative stress,
(c) is a contributor to dysregulated angiogenesis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and (d) that
inhibition of let-7b signaling improves lung angiogenesis and attenuates the BPD phenotype.
 We will test the hypotheses by the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1 – Determine if plasma let-7b-5p concentrations in extremely preterm infants track with lung
disease progression and correlate with response to therapy.
 Let-7b-5p will be measured in serial plasma samples from a well characterized prospective cohort of
150 extremely preterm infants. We will define the temporal changes in let-7b-5p with respiratory illness
severity, BPD staging and lung mechanics at 36w PMA, and with clinical therapies.
Specific Aim 2 – Determine the mechanisms of Let-7b release by newborn mouse lung airway epithelium
 To confirm that the let-7b-5p release by oxidative stress is the key upstream mechanism, we will use
novel transgenic mice. We will test the hypothesis that reduction of mitochondrial ROS reduces let-7b-5p
and the BPD phenotype, and determine the role of Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling using specific
inhibitors/modulators in cell culture models.
Specific Aim 3 – Determine effects of excessive let-7b-5p signaling on lung microvascular development.
 We will test the hypothesis that over-expression of let-7b-5p induces impaired lung microvascular
development, inducing a BPD phenotype in newborn mice even in normoxia, and that inhibition of let-7b-5p
improves lung development in hyperoxia- exposed newborn mouse lung (BPD model)."

ETAR and TXA2R signaling is essential to optimize blood flow through brain capillary networks, and that aberrant
activity through these receptors during amyloid beta (A) accumulation contributes to hypoperfusion. To address
this hypothesis, we will use an in vivo-ex vivo pipeline with innovative imaging approaches and a novel murine
Cre-driver to genetically target CNS pericytes. The work will be conducted by investigators with complementary
expertise in in vivo two-photon imaging of blood flow, ex vivo brain slice experiments, pericyte biology, and ETAR
and TXA2R signaling mechanisms. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ETAR and TXA2R signaling in pericytes
provides basal capillary tone and orchestrates optimization of flow through brain capillary networks. ETAR (ednra
gene), and separately, TXA2R (tbxa2r gene), will be conditionally deleted in capillary pericytes of normal mice.
In vivo deep two-photon imaging will be used to study capillary flow dynamics across cortical layers and into
callosal white matter of awake mice. A battery of vascular metrics, tissue hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and
behavioral outcomes will be assessed. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that G-protein signaling downstream of
ETAR and TXA2R requires actomyosin contractile machinery in capillary pericytes, despite low expression of α-
smooth muscle actin. We will use chemogenetics to drive G-protein activation, as seen downstream of ETAR
and TXA2R signaling. Pericytes will be chemogenetically contracted in ex vivo brain slices and blockers of
actomyosin and cytoskeletal machinery will be administered to dissect their roles in pericyte contraction. Further,
chemogenetic activation of CNS capillary pericytes in vivo will be characterized as a new model of cerebral
hypoperfusion. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that aberrant ETAR and TXA2R signaling drives deficiency in
capillary perfusion and cognitive decline during A accumulation. Conditional genetic deletion of ETAR or
TXA2R, and separately, chronic administration of ETAR/TXA2R inhibitors will be examined in two models of AD-
like pathology (Tg-SwDi and 5xFAD). Effects on cerebral blood flow, brain health, and behavioral metrics will be
examined. This project will advance our understanding of brain hypoperfusion in AD/ADRD by: (1) Deciphering
mechanisms of pericyte contractility in the normal and AD brain; (2) leveraging a novel capillary pericyte-specific
mouse line to dissect pericyte contributions to blood flow; (3) characterizing a novel model of capillary-driven
hypoperfusion in vivo; (4) employing advanced in vivo imaging approaches to study deep capillary networks
most strongly affected in AD/ADRD; (5) providing proof of concept preclinical studies to test if modulation of
ETAR and TXA2R signaling in pericytes can improve capillary network flow and cognition in AD/ADRD."
10884412,"Molecular subtyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has defined two major transcriptional
subtypes, Classical and Basal-like, which are presently the most powerful predictors of patient outcomes.
Thus, there is a critical need to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for PDAC cell identity.
Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that inactivation of PHF2, a histone demethylase, in low-passage
patient-derived Classical PDAC cells results in a striking loss of the Classical gene program and virtually
abolishes tumor growth. In addition, deletion of Phf2 suppresses pancreatic tumor initiation and prolongs
survival in genetically engineered mouse models. Moreover, our CUT&RUN experiments reveal that PHF2
co-localizes on chromosomes with CTCF and SMC3, proteins that contribute to cell identity by regulating
the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin. Based on these exciting preliminary results, our central
hypothesis is that PHF2, controls the Classical gene program in PDAC by regulating three-dimensional
architecture of chromatin. Experiments in this proposal will employ a unique collection of low-passage
human cell lines, high resolution mapping of chromatin-associated proteins and chromatin architecture, and
NanoString GeoMx spatial transcriptomic analysis of genetically engineered mouse models to define the
role of PHF2 in PDAC. Three specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis: 1) Define the subsets
of PDAC that are dependent on PHF2; 2) Identify the mechanisms by which PHF2 regulates gene expression
in PDAC; and 3) Define the contribution of Phf2 to tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mice. In the first
aim, orthotopic xenograft tumor models allowing for the temporal inactivation of PHF2 by CRISPR/Cas9 will
be employed to determine the importance of PHF2 in the maintenance of PDAC tumors as well as their
response to chemotherapy. In the second aim, CUT&RUN, HiChIP, and RNA-seq experiments will be
employed to define the global localization of PHF2 on chromatin in PDAC cells and ascertain its role in
recruiting CTCF and cohesion to DNA to mediate DNA loop formation. For the third aim, genetically
engineered mouse models of PDAC lacking Phf2 will be used to elucidate its role in the KRAS-driven
changes in cell identity required for pancreatic acinar cells to transform to invasive cancer . Spatial
transcriptomic studies will be performed to ascertain how Phf2 deficiency alters the composition of the tumor
microenvironment by the development of PDAC that is deficient in the Classical program. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because it will define a novel function for PHF2 in regulating
chromatin architecture, further elucidating the mechanisms that allow for cell type-specific chromatin
architecture. The proposed research is significant because it will provide strong evidence for the role of
epigenetic regulation of PDAC cell identity, ultimately providing new opportunities for the development of
novel therapies for PDAC."
10833686,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rationale: Low health literacy affects over a third of surgical populations and is associated with significantly
worse outcomes in surgery. Interventions that reduce disparities in this large population are urgently needed.
Our team has previously shown that enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) mitigate racial disparities in surgical
outcomes and offer a pragmatic way to address surgical disparities. Existing ERPs, however, work poorly for
patients with low health literacy who still experience worse outcomes. This gap arises from the lack of fit between
current ERPs and the needs of low health literacy patients. Through a K23, our team assessed these needs and
developed a novel multilevel strategy to improve fit: engage patients with VISuAl aids, Coach providers in
communication, and Train organizations in health literacy (VISACT). An opportunity now exists to deliver and
test the VISACT using a theory-based adaptation framework. Successful adaptations would transform existing
ERPs and broaden its disparity-reducing impact to low health literacy populations. Objectives: Our long-term
objective is to eliminate disparities and improve outcomes for low health literacy populations in surgery through
context-driven adaptations of existing ERPs. We hypothesize that VISACT will improve fidelity to ERP’s
components for low health literacy patients and thereby surgical outcomes. To achieve our objective, we aim to:
(SA1) identify the health literacy-sensitive components of ERPs to augment with VISACT, (SA2) assess the
health literacy needs of providers and organizational units on ERP teams, and (SA3) deliver and pilot test the
VISACT implementation strategy on existing ERPs. Methods: Guided by the Dynamics Adaptation Process
framework, we will first use machine learning on a large ERP database (n>7,000) to identify the health literacy-
sensitive components of ERPs to augment with VISACT (SA1). Second, we will use a convergent mixed-
methods integrative approach to identify gaps in health literacy knowledge, best practices, and preparedness to
adapt on ERP implementation teams through three interrelated methods: in vivo observations of ERPs in-action
at 4 Alabama facilities, extended semi-structured interviews of 120 stakeholders, and surveys measuring health
literacy knowledge and organizational preparedness to adapt. Third, we will deliver the VISACT to two sites in
Alabama (urban and rural) through a novel interactive response platform in a pilot study and assess for
feasibility/acceptability through a RE-AIM framework of reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance measures. Acquired data will inform design of a multi-institutional stepped-wedge trial of the
VISACT in the Deep South. Significance: This study will advance the NIH/NIMHD mission to eliminate surgical
disparities and responds directly to the NIMHD Science Visioning Research Strategies by removing health
literacy barriers (#24) and building the science of adapting interventions to different contexts (#30). Our team will
furthermore (i) deliver the first health literate intervention in surgery, (ii) establish a novel implementation strategy
(VISACT) to address surgical disparities and (iii) advance the science of interventions through adaptations."
10774330,"Project Summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is a common debilitating hereditary peripheral neuropathy. The
hallmark of CMT pathology is severely defective PNS myelin. There is currently no treatment or cure for
this disease. Roughly 75% of all cases of CMT are caused by Schwann cell overexpression of wild type
(WT) peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) due to trisomy (type 1A CMT), underexpression of PMP22 (for the
WT/null case), or genetically dominant heterozygous (WT/mutant) mutations that alter the PMP22 protein
sequence (type E CMT or the more severe Dejerine-Sottas Syndrome--DSS). Important questions remain
regarding the molecular mechanisms by which these different classes of defects in PMP22 result in
different forms of CMT. Here we propose to address key outstanding questions regarding the molecular
bases for the different forms of CMT.
 Aim 1. How does the trafficking and mis-trafficking of WT PMP22 under CMT1A WT
overexpression conditions differ from a folding-defective DSS mutant form of PMP22? We will test
the hypothesis that misfolded WT PMP22 ends up in the cytosol, whereas DSS mutants such as L16P
PMP22 are trapped in the ER or ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).
 Aim 2. Determine the role of the BAG6 complex (BAG6/GET4/UBL4A) in the cytosolic trafficking
of WT PMP22. Our preliminary data suggests that WT PMP22, but not DSS mutant forms of PMP22
interacts with the cytosolic BAG6 complex. This aim will test the hypothesis that the BAG6 complex
serves as a holdase for misfolded WT PMP22 to facilitate its healthy shuttling to the proteasome, but that
excess PMP22 in CMT1A overwhelms the proteasome, resulting in formation of aggresomes, which are
eventually degraded by BAG6-induced autophagy.
 Aim 3. Determine if excess WT PMP22 inhibits specific proteasome complexes and/or induces
phosphorylation of eIF2α in myelinating SCs. Prompted by our preliminary data, this Aim will test the
hypothesis that overexpression of WT PMP22 in SCs inhibits the 26S proteasome and activates an
integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2α to suppress protein translation."
10873752,"Inflammation evolved to lead to recovery from sterile or microbial injuries. The induction of the inflammatory process not only activates the immune cells, but also alters their metabolism and thus forge the immune response. Accumulating evidence shows that a proper inflammatory process requires the coincident recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). We recently demonstrated that the coincident recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of Gram-negative bacteria, and host-derived oxidized phospholipids known as oxPAPC (a class of DAMPs) leads to the formation of phagocytes characterized by a unique metabolic profile that increases the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. Whether, and how, the simultaneous encounter of LPS and oxPAPC alters other inflammatory activities of phagocytes remains largely unknown. Based on new compelling data, here we hypothesize that the coincident recognition of LPS and oxPAPC alters key metabolic checkpoints to drive hyper-inflammation. Also, that these changes can be harnessed against septic shock. Sepsis is a complex inflammatory syndrome characterized by a hyper-inflammatory phase called septic shock. Although it was previously proposed that oxPAPC protects against the hyperinflammatory phase of sepsis by inhibiting the capacity of LPS to signal, our new unpublished data show instead that oxPAPC production follows LPS or bacterial encounter in vivo and that oxPAPC increases inflammation and lethality in mouse models of sepsis. Notably, we found that, to exert its functions, oxPAPC directly interacts with, and inhibits, AKT. AKT is a central metabolic checkpoint that regulates the metabolism of phagocytes and their inflammatory activity. AKT inhibition by oxPAPC prevents the production of IL-10. IL-10 is a pluripotent immunoregulatory cytokine indispensable for maintaining immune homeostasis and restricting inflammation during sepsis. Mechanistically, oxPAPC-dependent inhibition of AKT potentiates the methionine cycle and favors the trimethylation of the histone H3, thus switching off IL-10 transcription. Supported by our new solid data, we will employ biochemistry, transcriptional and epigenetic analyses, as well as metabolomics in vitro to further dissect the signaling cascade initiated by oxPAPC during LPS encounter. By using new transgenic or conditional knock-out mice, as well as commercially available drugs, we will test in vivo the possibility to target the newly identified metabolic pathways regulated by oxPAPC to protect against sepsis. Altogether we will characterize the molecular components that mediate host-derived inflammatory ligand-dependent immunometabolic functions. Our study will offer potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune system activation and sepsis, a devastating inflammatory syndrome that is widespread in western countries."
10814250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy and failure involve a rewiring of gene expression through alternative splicing, but it remains
unclear which splicing changes are relevant to disease development, and how splice variants affect protein
function. Although many alternative transcript isoforms have been discovered, not all are translated into
proteins and instead may be degraded via non-sense mediated decay or co-translational protein quality control.
Proteomics methods that can identify and quantitate splice variant proteins empirically and on a large scale
provide essential tools to study how alternative splicing regulates cardiac gene expression. We and others
showed that tissue-specific splice variant proteins may be identified using a combined RNA sequencing and
mass spectrometry approach. Accordingly, our goal here is to examine the mechanisms by which alternative
splicing regulates the genetic program in hypertrophic and failing hearts, by identifying the proteins and
pathways that are coordinately regulated by splicing, the resulting complement of protein isoform species
(`proteoforms') in the heart, and the consequences of proteoform sequences on protein structure and function.
Specifically, we plan to: (1) apply a quantitative RNA-guided proteomics framework to identify key isoform
switches at the transcript and the protein level, with emphasis on the changes in splice factors and RNA-binding
proteins in mouse models of systolic and diastolic dysfunction; (2) combine RNA-guided proteomics and
proteome-wide biophysics approaches, we will interrogate the impact of splice variants on protein structure
and thermal stability, and discover significant isoforms through alternative splicing, intrinsically disordered, and
regulatory post-translational modification modules. We anticipate the successful completion of these aims will
generate new conceptual insights into how alternative splicing regulatory networks reprogram the cardiac
proteome in pathological remodeling and heart failure, and more generally, contribute to methods and concepts
to elucidate the regulation and function of alternative splicing in the heart."
10807031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite advances in surgical techniques and clinical regimens, malignant gliomas usually progress or recur after
treatment. Currently, visual inspection of imaging data is the mainstay to monitor glioma progression; however,
this approach may not be accurate or refined enough to monitor treatment response or evolving prognostic
subtypes. Imaging data has limited ability to distinguish 1) gliomas from other tumors (e.g., primary central
nervous system lymphoma), 2) progression from pseudoprogression (pseudoPD) resulting from therapy-induced
necrosis, or 3) minimal or remnant tumoral burden. Recently, we and others found that potential drivers of glioma
progression are mediated by gene mutation and epigenetic abnormalities. Generally, cancer molecular
signatures are identifiable in tumoral tissue; however, several groups have reported that tumor specific
signatures using both genetics and DNA methylation can be captured by non- or minimally-invasive approach
such as liquid biopsy (LB) using biospecimens such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid. To address this knowledge
gap in the role of LB to monitor glioma progression/recurrence, we aim to establish a novel approach to detect
postoperative malignant glioma using DNA methylation of blood-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) markers with the
ultimate goal to fine-tune surveillance and treatment in real time. With available DNA methylation data extracted
from serum/plasma cfDNA at initial diagnosis, we will develop a non-invasive Glioma-score that is associated
with prognostically relevant subtypes of glioma (e.g., G-CIMP-high vs -low), gliomas harboring unique and
druggable genetic alterations (FGFR3-TACC3 [F3-T3]) and gliomas developing in patients with
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1-glioma) (Aim 1). From available cohorts spanning longitudinal specimens
accrued for more than a decade, we will profile the epigenome of paired primary and recurrent sets (e.g., first,
second /or third recurrence), and develop a Glioma recurrence (GliomaR)-score associated with recurrence, and
response to therapy (Aim 2). Based on our defined scores, we will classify patients into defined prognostic
groups (e.g., good and poor outcome) and risk to recur as a more aggressive subtype upon recurrence
subgroups. This will assess the accuracy of LB to monitor postoperative progression of different molecular
subtypes of glioma throughout an individual’s disease. We will utilize the quantitative and semi-quantitative
imaging features routinely used in the diagnosis and monitoring of glioma to correlate the epigenomic markers
of the LB Glioma-score with well established glioma imaging standards and tailor the LB score towards the
resolution of the current limitations of imaging data for human glioma (e.g., pseudoPD and radiation necrosis)
(Aim 3). Our study will be the first to investigate glioma whole-epigenome LB markers to detect aggressive
gliomas at initial diagnosis and during tumor progression. Accurate diagnosis through a simple blood test will
allow clinicians to detect the evolution of the disease in real-time, thus identifying high-risk patients who may
benefit from more aggressive therapy at an earlier point when intervention could be more effective."

10868466,"The Acres Homes region in Houston, TX, is a predominantly African American and Hispanic community, a persistent poverty area with 69% of the residents living in food desert areas, and over 40% of the adult residents reportedly being obese. Ours is a cluster-randomized trial to assess the impact of Brighter Bites (BB), a school-based intervention improving access to fresh produce and nutrition education, on obesity and metabolic outcomes among children enrolled across 12 elementary schools serving the Acres Homes community and their parents. BB is proven to be effective at engaging parents, improving healthy dietary behaviors, reducing food insecurity, in low-income elementary school children in the short and long term. However, the impact of the program on obesity and metabolic measures in children or parents is unknown. Using an interweaving approach, BB will be integrated into Be Well Acres Homes, a place-based cancer prevention initiative. Elementary schools will be randomized to the BB intervention or waitlisted control condition (12 schools, 720 parent-child dyads). At BB schools, families will receive 16 distributions of 20-25 lbs. (~50 servings) of fresh produce to take home, recipe tastings, and hands-on, robust nutrition education in school, and for parents, access to the BB mobile app during one school year, with the option to continue participation in the BB program for two subsequent school years. Children and parents will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (~9 months) and 21-months follow-up for the following outcomes: height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) via finger stick, blood pressure (BP), dietary intake via screener, child skin carotenoid levels, diet-related behaviors, home availability/access to FV and food insecurity status via questionnaires. Aim 1: Our primary aim is to examine the effects of the BB intervention compared to wait-list control at post-intervention on changes in primary child outcomes (BMI z-score, HbA1c, and vegetable intake) Aim 2: To examine the effects of the BB intervention compared to wait-list control at 9-month post intervention on changes in secondary outcomes (household food security status, parent BMI, HbA1c, BP, parent and child dietary behaviors, and home access/availability of FV). Aim 3: To examine the mediational influence of changes in food security status, parent outcomes, and home environment measures on changes in child outcomes at 9-month post-intervention. Aim 4: Using within-subject analyses, examine and compare the long-term and dose-response effects of the BB intervention strategies on diet, adiposity, and metabolic outcomes at 21-mos follow-up in the children. Aim 5: Explore the moderating effects of social (financial distress, experiences of discrimination, health literacy, and social connectedness), and environmental variables (proximity to food access sources, food environment, and neighborhood social vulnerability) on program effectiveness. This project will inform the translation and scaling efforts of BB, a highly successful natural experiment. It also advances dissemination and implementation science by studying and improving upon implementation to increase program reach and impact in persistent poverty areas such as Acres Homes."
10868470,"The field of cancer prevention and control has grown, however, the cadre of trained and experienced researchers dedicated to cancer prevention in underserved communities grappling with persistent poverty, particularly those trained for multidisciplinary collaboration, remains too small to sufficiently advance the state of the art in cancer prevention and control. Our overall goal is to train early career investigators in the US to join a cadre of scholars who are able and purposefully lead key research efforts in multiple aspects of cancer prevention and control/population science. Such training is critical for success in research and implementation of health programs and practices in underserved settings and are not often emphasized in cancer research training or with sufficient detail in broad programs of cancer prevention and control. Long-term success in such career paths also requires skills in career navigation, resilience, and career persistence that can be fostered through formal training, mentorship by assigned mentors, and role models that will be part of the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) and throughout the proposed Center for Transformative Community Driven Research to Prevent Obesity-related Cancer. The specific aims of the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) are to (1) recruit, select, and train high-performing early career scientists for careers leading cancer prevention research in underserved communities, specifically in persistent poverty areas; (2) provide mentored research training experiences in a variety of cancer prevention disciplines; (3) develop a multidisciplinary cancer curriculum with emphasis on drivers of persistent poverty and its impact, research methods used in community settings, and career development for professionals in the field; and (4) evaluate the Program’s effectiveness and track trainees over time. The CEC takes advantage of its integration with the two Research Projects (Brighter Bites; Active Living After Cancer) and the other Cores, including activities funded by the BeWell infrastructure. For two regionally recruited doctoral students and two nationally recruited postdoctoral fellows (one supported by the U54 award, an additional postdoctoral fellow supported by pledged institutional funds), in 3-year appointments, the Engagement Core serves to connect trainees with opportunities for experiential learning embedded within community organizations, helping them learn how to foster relationships with them. A novel aspect of the CEC is its creation of a new Community Action Workshop series to foster conducting community research and a new Grantsmanship Workshop for trainees and community organization staff to train together for synergy and fostering collaborations. The grant training will be structured and scheduled around RFAs launched by the Development Core, for which they will help teach. Leaders of the Research and Methodology Core will also provide support for instruction for the new grantsmanship workshop, as well as providing guidance and support for trainee project data collection and analysis. Trainees will build their mentored research projects around the two research projects of the center (BB and ALAC)."

We envision the Core as an opportunity not only to reinforce the Center, but also to ensure that it is agile and responsive to the latest developments in the field. The key function of the Core will be to identify and maintain a pipeline of pilot projects that may grow into full projects to accelerate generation of knowledge on effective interventions for reducing risk and suffering from cancer in the context of persistent poverty. The Developmental Core will encourage pilot projects that incorporate consideration of the unique context of this persistent poverty community and leverage the Center’s transdisciplinary expertise. Collaborating with community partners through Be Well™ Acres Homes to implement evidence-based cancer prevention interventions enables researchers to test novel interventions, or evaluate hypotheses related to the effects of contextual variables on cancer prevention, in the context of these neighborhood-level programs and resources. The existing Be Well Acres Homes community action plan will provide unique opportunities for pilot projects not only within the Center but also across other funded persistent poverty centers, and the Persistent Poverty Initiative Network. Active engagement with the Engagement Core, Be Well Acres Homes Community Advisors ensures that research questions are grounded in the needs and priorities of the community by working collaboratively with community members in every step of research, from forming research questions and priorities and soliciting proposals, to review and make funding decisions. This meaningful engagement will serve as “a powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental and behavioral changes that will improve the health of the community and its members.”"
10866574,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
Engaging diverse intellectual capital is imperative for finding creative solutions for complex problems at the
frontiers of biomedical science. As a large public institution, the University of Michigan (UM) has been deeply
involved in both the science and practice of diversity-building. Identifying targets for intervention to promote the
careers of NIH-funded researchers has been a key scholarly focus of PI Reshma Jagsi, who has led national
programs to promote the vitality of the biomedical research workforce. Promoting cross-institutional change in
the service of inclusive excellence at UM has been led for the past 8 years by PI Robert Sellers, UM's first
Chief Diversity Officer. Together with innovative leaders across our campus, we now propose to establish the
Michigan Program for Advancing Cultural Transformation (M-PACT) to consolidate our gains and deepen our
commitment to expanding and sustaining diversity in the biomedical and health sciences. M-PACT will build on
UM's successful Collegiate Fellows Program, a fellows-to-faculty pipeline designed by Co-I Tabbye Chavous,
UM's new Chief Diversity Officer; since its inception, that program has successfully recruited 45 new tenure-
track faculty with demonstrated commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). M-PACT will broaden the
reach of this robust pilot program by expanding from one unit to 11 biomedical and health science units across
campus, and address an institutional gap, i.e., recruiting a critical mass of faculty committed to DEI, which is
needed for sustained impact. M-PACT's Administrative Core will oversee the recruitment of 30 new tenure-
track early-career investigators in 3 research clusters that span the breadth of NIH's mission: 1) Basic
Biomedical Research; 2) Clinical-Translational Research; and 3) Social and Behavioral Research. M-PACT's
Faculty Development (FD) Core will train a pool of accomplished Sponsor-Mentors with commitment to DEI
who will serve the M-PACT Scholars and transform culture by seeding change in departments across campus.
The FD Core will implement evidence-based practices, including training to support career development and
networking and culturally aware coaching support to develop the skills of Scholars to succeed in research, find
satisfaction in their professional and community/residential lives and develop into leaders who can sustain the
transformed culture. M-PACT's Evaluation Core will rigorously assess this process and outcomes to inform and
refine the program and disseminate generally. We anticipate that M-PACT will improve the productivity, career
trajectories and experiences of M-PACT Scholars and help transform the broader DEI climate through an
innovative approach that includes deep training of embedded Sponsor-Mentors, Scholars and unit-level
mentors and leaders positioned to affect the experiences of faculty and learners well beyond the Scholars
alone. Buy-in from across the highest levels of central administration, decanal support from the 11 participating
schools/colleges/institutes and close involvement of department leaders will foster institutionalization of best
practices and policies to ensure long-term cultural change."
10866575,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
To drive diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts around faculty hiring, the Michigan Program for Advancing
Cultural Transformation (M-PACT) at the University of Michigan (UM) proposes to hire and nurture a cohort of
new faculty in the biomedical and health sciences, help build a pipeline of diverse scholars, institutionalize best
practices for advancing sustainable DEI impact and broadly disseminate valuable lessons learned. Toward
those objectives, M-PACT will establish a strong Administrative Core to manage and coordinate the program's
activities. A major strength of the Administrative Core is the expertise and dedication of its leadership and key
personnel. The diverse team of faculty and staff are in line with the primary objective of M-PACT, which is to
diversify the faculty in the biomedical and health sciences at UM. The core also has strong internal and
external advisory bodies that will guide program strategy, act as mechanisms of accountability, and serve to
help the program navigate potential challenges and issues. With all of these assets, the core will achieve the
following specific aims: 1) establish a cohesive governance structure that leverages the significant experience
and expertise of the key personnel and strong support of the UM leadership to manage all administrative and
financial components that will enable M-PACT to achieve its program goals in an effective and efficient
manner; 2) administratively support the implementation of a cohort model to hire and successfully nurture 30
new faculty across 11 top-tier UM schools, colleges and institutes, using evidence-based practices and
procedures to reduce bias in the search process, as well as to develop more diverse pools of outstanding
candidates that meet the requirements of the NIH FIRST Program, including through an expansion of the
vibrant NextProf program – a valuable conference for preparing URM graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows nationwide for academic careers – to health sciences; and 3) disseminate important M-PACT findings,
outcomes and applications. The core's efforts will contribute to the ongoing cultural transformation efforts at
UM towards inclusive excellence by working with M-PACT constituencies (i.e., executive committee, Deans'
Advisory Committee, Cluster Leads and Sponsor-Mentors) to institutionalize best practices. The core will work
closely with the National Center for Institutional Diversity to disseminate the knowledge around best practices
that results from the evaluation of M-PACT's hiring processes and faculty development programming to the
broader fields of biomedical and health sciences research via conferences, academic publications, social
media and other means of public communication."
10865142,"Project Summary
 Mechanically ventilated children often have patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) although this is
incompletely characterized in the literature and infrequently recognized at the bedside. When a ventilated
patient has spontaneous effort, the ventilator attempts to synchronize with the patient, but PVA represents a
mismatch between what the patient wants and what the ventilator delivers. PVA is common in ventilated
adults and is associated with longer duration of ventilation, increased risk of infection, lung injury, diaphragm
dysfunction, and adverse neurocognitive effects. While there are many types of PVA, they are not equally
harmful or prevalent. Therapeutic strategies should focus on the most harmful forms of PVA. Although we still
don’t know which PVA subtypes are truly most harmful, Double Cycled (DC) breaths (where a second breath is
delivered before the first breath is complete) have the strongest biological plausibility for harm, because DC
induces lung stress, strain, ventilator induced lung injury and eccentric contraction of the diaphragm.
 PVA is understudied in children, even though it may be more common and goes largely unrecognized
even by highly trained clinicians. Moreover, existing pediatric studies have failed to identify a clear relationship
between PVA and worse clinical outcomes, although these studies have not focused on the highest risk
patients (such as those with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)), have used different definitions for
PVA and its subtypes, and have been inadequately powered to evaluate the relationship between PVA
subtypes and outcome. This proposal will set the stage for therapeutic strategies to manage PVA in children
and will fill crucial knowledge and implementation gaps including: (1) harmonizing how PVA is measured and
defined, (2) identifying the most harmful PVA subtypes and the patients at risk, and (3) using innovative and
accurate bedside tools to improve the recognition of PVA. We will leverage the expertise and preliminary data
from three premier pediatric research groups who have the expertise to use precise methods to capture the
patient’s neural respiratory effort, which is crucial to correctly identify PVA subtypes. This proposal will include
prospective, multi-center collection of ventilator waveforms from 200 ventilated children using precise
techniques to capture neural respiratory effort, in addition to detailed secondary analysis of existing waveforms
and clinical data from over 350 children. We will use causal inference and mediation approaches to evaluate
the relationship between PVA subtypes and clinical and mechanistic outcomes by leveraging data from a
randomized controlled trial (REDVent, R01HL124666) where PVA rates and subtypes likely differ between
intervention and control groups. This trial is prescribing a mechanical ventilation strategy promoting more
spontaneous breathing to achieve lung and diaphragm protective ventilation, compared to usual care."

induced tumor-supportive microenvironment. CSCs are regulated by cell intrinsic genetic and epigenetic
networks, extrinsic cellular interactions with the surrounding microenvironment, and the interaction between
those intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory programs. While multiple molecular mechanisms that drive self-renewal
have been identified, the effects of advanced age on CSC maintenance has yet to be explored. Specifically, it is
unclear how advanced age alters CSC maintenance and GBM growth. A recently recognized hallmark of
advanced age is the shift in sulfur amino acid metabolism that suppresses enzyme-dependent hydrogen sulfide
(H2S) generation, signaling, and bioavailability. H2S is a redox-active metabolite that signals through protein S-
sulfhydration (R-SSnH) and impacts metabolism, immune activation, and longevity. Its enzymatic production by
cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL) is repressed by thyroid hormone (TH). H2S has both pro- and anti-tumorigenic
functions that are tumor-type dependent. However, there is limited information on cell intrinsic and tumor
microenvironment functions of H2S in GBM. Recently, we modulated H2S levels through dietary and
pharmacological interventions and found that H2S functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM and attenuates CSC
self-renewal and tumor growth in pre-clinical models. H2S generation and sulfhydration were decreased in human
GBM specimens as compared to non-tumor controls. While the data support the hypothesis that H2S functions
as a tumor suppressor in GBM, the effects of aging-induced H2S declines on GBM progression and CSCs, and
how to reverse this for clinical use, are unexplored. Based on our published findings and new preliminary data,
we hypothesize that decreased H2S production during aging promotes CSC initiation, immune
suppression, and drives GBM growth but can ultimately be reversed by anti-TH based H2S boosting
approaches. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims by integrating our newly developed H2S and
sulfhydration detection assays in combination with in vitro and in vivo GBM models that manipulate H2S
production via genetic and pharmacological interventions with human samples to provide clinical relevance. Aim
1 tests the hypothesis that aging-induced suppression of CGL-derived H2S accelerates GBM progression. Aim
2 tests the hypothesis that chemically-induced hypothyroidism stimulates CGL to increase systemic and neural
H2S production resulting in reduced GBM progression, CSC enrichment, and improved survival in preclinical
GBM models. The long-term goal of this project is to interrogate the function of H2S as a GBM tumor suppressor
that is lost during aging, while also studying the therapeutic effects of hypothyroid-induced H2S production and
signaling to reduce CSC maintenance and immune suppression. Leveraging this axis represents a new strategy
for the management of GBM that may synergize with standard of care chemo-, radio-, and immunotherapies."

Public perception of myopia as a simple inconvenience masks its sight-threatening
consequences. Even moderate levels of myopia predispose an individual to glaucoma at rates
equal to a hypertensive's risk for cardiovascular disease. Yet, we lack specific diagnostic markers
to identify glaucoma in myopic patients. In fact, myopic eyes can exhibit anatomical changes
difficult to distinguish from glaucoma. This is alarming because half the world population is
predicted to be myopic in 30 years, which will increase significantly the global prevalence of
myopic glaucoma and associated visual impairment. Glaucoma is a complex neuropathy that
preferentially affects the ganglion cell complex (GCC). Myopia results in significant eye growth,
and appears related to glaucoma through its effect on the optic nerve head. However, the
mechanisms that link myopia and glaucoma, in particular the effect of myopic growth on the GCC,
remain unexplored. We hypothesize that glaucoma and myopia are linked via mechanisms that
sense and respond to mechanical stimuli and affect the GCC. The long-term goal of this research
is to identify the mechanisms of myopic glaucoma and explore novel neuroprotection therapeutics
to prolong ganglion cell function and survival. The overall objectives in this application are to
identify early 1) genetic, 2) cellular, 3) structural and 4) functional markers of glaucoma
longitudinally as experimental eyes develop progressive myopia compared to eyes induced with
glaucoma. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on
identifying key hallmarks of glaucoma comparing unique animal models of myopia and glaucoma
that mimic the prolonged exposure to sustained eye growth experienced by human myopic eyes
over time, which is fundamental to understanding how glaucoma can originate from myopia. This
research will have a direct positive impact as a tool to accelerate the development of novel
prevention and diagnostic strategies for myopic glaucoma, and open up new research avenues
for pharmacological interventions and experimental therapeutics to prevent glaucomatous
impairment in myopic eyes. The proposed research is significant because is expected to provide
strong evidence of the unknown nature of the myopia-glaucoma relationship, will help clinicians
address the long-standing challenge of diagnosing glaucoma in myopic eyes, epidemiologists
refine distribution patterns of myopic glaucoma, public health professionals develop prevention
strategies and campaigns, and scientists create new research avenues for myopic glaucoma."

lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, approximately 45% of people with PAD do not
meaningfully improve in response to exercise. Biologic pathways that mediate the beneficial effects of
exercise and biologic explanations for non-response to exercise in PAD are unknown. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that exercise-induced shear stress stimulates nitric oxide synthase to
increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability during exercise, thereby improving leg perfusion, skeletal muscle
 mitochondrial activity, and walking ability in PAD. We further

 demonstrated that plasma nitrite increased by 39.3% in 41

12-week f/up, compared to a no-exercise control; 2) that exercise “responders” have greater Δ nitrite increases
than “non-responders”; 3) among non-responders to 12 weeks of supervised exercise, that supplementing
exercise with nitrate-rich beetroot juice for an additional 12 weeks increases Δ nitrite and improves 6-min. walk

improvements in calf muscle perfusion and mitochondrial activity, brachial artery FMD, and 6-minute walk. If
our hypotheses are correct, this trial will, for the first time, establish Δ nitrite as a critical mediator of
the benefits of exercise in PAD. Results will also delineate a key biologic pathway of exercise non-
response, thereby identifying an important therapeutic target for future interventions in PAD."
10812444,"Project Summary: Hypertriglyceridemia, a condition in which blood triglyceride (TG) levels are elevated, is a
major risk factor of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease. Clearance of plasma TG is primarily mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL,
expressed by the parenchymal cells of lipolytic tissues, is transported to capillary lumen by the endothelial cell
transporter GPIHBP1, where it hydrolyzes plasma TG for local uptake into peripheral tissues. Although significant
progress has been made, the fine-tune regulation of LPL activity as well as TG lipolysis and partitioning into
peripheral tissues remain to be further elucidated.
 In the last funding cycle, we revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-tethered, liver-enriched
transcriptional factor CREBH functions as a diurnal metabolic regulator that integrates circadian regulation to
energy homeostasis. Recently, we discovered that the C-terminal fragment of CREBH (CREBH-C), produced
through Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), is secreted from the liver into circulation as a “hepatokine”
upon energy demands. Secreted CREBH-C interacts with angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) and ANGPTL8 to
prevent the inhibitory interactions between ANGPTL3/8 and LPL, thus promoting LPL activity and TG partitioning
into peripheral tissues. Circulatory CREBH-C promotes TG clearance and partitioning and mitigates
hypertriglyceridemia caused by over-nutrition. These lines of evidence prompted us to hypothesize that ER
membrane-tethered CREBH is processed by RIP to produce a novel hepatokine, CREBH-C, which interacts with
ANGPTLs to regulate intravascular LPL activity, TG partitioning into peripheral tissues, and whole-body
metabolism. CREBH-C intervention may increase metabolic flexibility and thus mitigate hypertriglyceridemia and
the associated metabolic disorders. In this application, we will utilize molecular and cellular approaches, genetic
animal models, as well as innovative LPL-monitoring and lipid-tracing approaches to define a novel hepatokine,
CREBH-C, and its regulatory roles in LPL activity and TG homeostasis: Aim 1, to define the mechanistic pathway
by which the ER membrane-tethered CREBH is processed to produce a secreted form of CREBH; Aim 2, to
delineate the regulation and mechanistic basis by which CREBH-C interacts with ANGPTL3/8 to regulate LPL
activity; Aim 3, to determine the functional significance of CREBH-C in regulating TG partitioning and whole-
body metabolism and in mitigating hypertriglyceridemia and the associated metabolic phenotypes.
 Within the funding period, we anticipate defining a new paradigm that a stress-induced protein fragment,
derived from the ER membrane protein CREBH, can function as a potent hepatokine to regulate lipid
homeostasis and whole-body metabolism. Revealing this unprecedented regulatory pathway for CREBH and its
derived hepatokine will have important implications in therapeutic interventions toward the control of
hypertriglyceridemia and the associated metabolic and cardiovascular disorders."
10824280,"Project Summary
 Nearly 1 in 3 American adults has metabolic syndrome, a complex disorder defined by elevations in blood
sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Patients with metabolic syndrome have a high cardiovascular disease risk
due to interactions among the elevated blood metabolites. However, since we do not have good methods for
studying integrated and interacting metabolic changes, we treat each metabolic abnormality individually. As a
result, patients are often on multiple medications, potentially decreasing the ability of each drug to normalize
blood metabolites and raising the risk for negative drug interactions.
 In this project, we propose a novel integrated experimental and computational bioengineering approach to
study how metabolic abnormalities contribute to cardiovascular disease. Specifically, we will study metabolic
interactions between endothelial cells, which line the inside of the blood vessels, and vascular smooth muscle
cells, which contribute to cardiovascular disease when they change their function. We will engineer a
computational isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis (iMFA) model, which uses experimental mass
spectrometry data to estimate intracellular metabolic fluxes and metabolite transport. The computational model
will enable us to develop new hypotheses for and plan studies into how metabolic changes (from altered blood
metabolites or therapies) affect the vascular wall.
 We hypothesize that EC metabolic dysfunction increases the transport of metabolites that promote VSMC to
switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. In turn, synthetic vSMC enhance EC metabolite transport to
support proliferation. To explore this hypothesis, we will combine in vitro, in silico, and ex vivo studies to: 1)
Determine how EC dysfunction in altered metabolic environments impacts metabolite transport; 2) Measure how
altered metabolites synergistically shift vSMC to a synthetic phenotype; and 3) Investigate how EC-vSMC
crosstalk impacts cell metabolism and phenotype in the vascular wall.
 We will start with single cell models of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, which will simulate the
diversity of human nutrient levels. We will the integrate the two cell types to understand their crosstalk in vitro,
in silico, and ex vivo. At each step, we will relate metabolism to cell phenotype and function to link the model to
cardiovascular disease.
 The computational iMFA model of integrated endothelial-vascular smooth muscle cell metabolism, transport,
and function will enable us to develop new hypotheses for and plan studies into how metabolic changes from
altered blood metabolites or therapies affect the vascular wall. By changing the parenchymal cell type, the model
can then be extended to study vascular metabolic interactions in other tissues (e.g., brain) and shed light into
other diseases in which integrated EC metabolism and transport (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease)."
10782526,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Viruses that infect the developing brain, including Zika virus (ZIKV), cytomegalovirus, and rubella virus cause
major birth defects. Microcephaly is one such birth defect, in which head and brain size are severely reduced,
and is often accompanied by intellectual disability. This virally-inflicted neurological disease, or viral
neuropathogenesis, can be caused by multiple mechanisms. One recently identified way ZIKV non-structural
protein 4A (NS4A) causes microcephaly is by disrupting the human ANKLE2 protein. Interestingly, individuals
with mutations in the gene encoding ANKLE2 suffer from microcephaly. ANKLE2 is conserved from worms to
humans, and is essential for coordinating cell division during brain development. ANKLE2 derives this function
in cell division and development by mediating protein interactions. NS4A physically interacts with ANKLE2 and
disrupts brain development in an ANKLE2-dependent manner in a fruit fly model of brain development. ANKLE2
also promotes ZIKV replication. Taken together, these studies show that in the process of coopting a host protein
for replication, ZIKV dysregulates an important developmental pathway. Thus, the NS4A-ANKLE2 protein
interaction represents an important model to study viral neuropathogenesis and how it is connected to viral
replication and hereditary disorders at the molecular level.
The long-term goal of this work is to decipher how virus-host protein interactions impact virus replication and
pathogenesis, as these discoveries will fuel therapeutic target identification and drug development. The
objective of this proposal is to dissect the mechanisms by which the protein interaction between ZIKV NS4A
and human ANKLE2 promote ZIKV replication and inhibit brain development. To accomplish this objective, we
will test the central hypothesis that ANKLE2 promotes viral replication through its interaction with NS4A and
by recruiting other host factors involved in ZIKV replication to sites of replication, and this disrupts physiological
ANKLE2 protein interactions required for brain development. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis:
Aim 1: Dissect the impact of the NS4A-ANKLE2 protein interaction in ZIKV replication and pathogenesis.
Aim 2: Unravel the molecular function of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication and pathogenesis.
When completed, this work will delineate how a single virus-host protein interaction rewires a developmental
pathway to facilitate virus replication and inflict neurological disease at the molecular level. This will reveal
detailed biochemical insight into a virus-host protein interaction with amino acid-level resolution, new host factors
that play a role in ZIKV replication, and previously unknown proteins key to brain development and disrupted in
other hereditary developmental disorders. In the long term, the methods established here could be employed to
uncover the molecular mechanisms behind other diseases with viral and hereditary etiologies."
10837686,"ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate blood and immune cells throughout life. Unfortunately, HSC
function declines with age. Age-related defects in HSCs lead to anemia, impaired immunity, bone marrow failure
and cancer. Thus, understanding mechanisms that contribute to HSC aging is critical for developing strategies
to enhance regeneration and tissue function in older adults. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) dysfunction
contributes to several age-associated pathologies, but diminished proteostasis has not been examined as a
mechanism of HSC aging. We recently discovered that HSCs are particularly dependent on proteostasis to
preserve their self-renewal capacity. However, misfolded proteins arise in HSCs and therefore must be
eliminated to preserve HSC fitness. Canonically, the proteasome serves as the primary pathway for degradation
of misfolded proteins, but we found that proteasome activity is low within HSCs. This raises a fundamental
paradox: if HSCs are highly dependent on proteostasis, why do they have such limited proteasome capacity to
degrade misfolded proteins? In preliminary studies, we found that mouse and human HSCs preferentially
express the co-chaperone Bag3, which can promote delivery of misfolded proteins to aggresomes. Aggresomes
are inclusion bodies containing misfolded and aggregated proteins that typically form in response to stress and
are substrates for a selective form of autophagy (aggrephagy). We determined that HSCs form aggresomes,
even under steady state conditions, and they depend on autophagy to degrade protein aggregates in vivo.
Furthermore, we generated data demonstrating that protein aggregates accumulate in aging HSCs and that old
adult HSCs activate Hsf1, key proteostasis sensor that helps preserve HSC fitness. Based on these data, our
central hypothesis is that HSCs preferentially shuttle misfolded proteins to aggresomes and depend on
aggrephagy to maintain proteostasis, fitness and longevity. Furthermore, we propose that accumulation of
aggregated proteins contributes to age-related declines in HSC function. In Aim 1, we will test if mouse and
human HSCs preferentially form aggresomes. Using conditional Bag3 knockout mice, we will test if disrupting
transport of misfolded proteins to aggresomes impairs HSC function, proteostasis and aging. In Aim 2, we will
use genetic mouse models to express disease-associated protein aggregates in HSCs to test the effects of
protein aggregation on HSC function. We will also determine if aggrephagy regulates HSC fitness, protein
synthesis and quiescence. In Aim 3, we will quantify protein aggregates in aging mouse and human HSCs, and
test if protein aggregation induces Hsf1 activation. Finally, we will test if enhancing Hsf1 activity rescues age-
related declines in HSC function. Research outcomes will uncover how misfolded proteins are eliminated in
HSCs and if accumulation of aggregated proteins contributes to HSC aging. These studies will identify strategies
to manipulate proteostasis to enhance HSC fitness and delay/prevent hematological disease in older adults."

About 40-45% of people living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) reside in a skilled nursing
facility (SNF). Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in ~80% of older adults with
ADRD living in an SNF. Antipsychotic medications (APMs) are the most commonly used pharmacological
treatment for BPSD. Because APMs are associated with numerous adverse events, clinical guidelines
recommend that their use should be limited to managing acute episodes and discontinued as soon as possible.
However, studies have shown that APMs are often used in individuals with ADRD for sustained periods (≥6
months). Small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing withdrawing vs. continuing APMs used for BPSD
have yielded conflicting and confusing results that suggested deprescribing APMs had little or no benefits for
adverse events. These RCTs were clearly underpowered, and they severely underrepresented frail and complex
older adults with ADRD in routine care. There was also a lack of non-randomized studies addressing this critical
knowledge gap because deprescribing APMs for behavior disturbance is highly informed by symptom severity,
and confounding by disease severity can be very difficult to control unless detailed clinical information is available
for research. Our objective is to assess the health effects of different APM deprescribing strategies for managing
BPSD in an SNF. To provide solid evidence guiding the deprescribing process, we will assess the effects of
discontinuing APMs with vs. without gradual dose reduction and different rates of dose tapering. We will integrate
Medicare claims data with electronic health records (EHR), Minimum Data Set (MDS), and Certification and
Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER), covering >370,000 older adults with ADRD living in an SNF
from 2013 to 2026. We will employ the clone-censor-weight approach, high-dimensional machine-learning-aided
proxy adjustment methods, external adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis to minimize measured and
unmeasured confounding. We will address three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the prescribing and
discontinuation patterns and determine the barriers to APMs deprescribing among older adults with BPSD in an
SNF. 2) To determine comparative health outcomes of different discontinuation strategies vs. continuation of
APMs used for BPSD in older adults who reside in an SNF. 3) To determine the treatment effect heterogeneity
by key clinical phenotypes when comparing continuation vs. different discontinuation strategies of APMs used
for BPSD in older adults who reside in an SNF so that such deprescribing decisions can be tailored according to
patient characteristics. The impact of this proposal is high because it will generate direct evidence to inform
optimal management of psychotropic medications in older adults with ADRD living in an SNF. It will also yield a
scalable analytical framework specializing in comparative safety and effectiveness analyses of deprescribing
psychotropic treatments for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia."

innovative new approaches for genome browsing that other visualization research programs can and do
build upon. During the next five years, I will continue using state-of-the-art open source software
development methods adapted to an academic setting to build and release advanced tools at low cost,
while training students in computer science and bioinformatics. First, I will continue to develop new ways
to exploit emerging public and private cloud infrastructure to meet biologists’ increasingly complex needs
for advanced visual analytics. Using commercial and free-of-charge, public sector cloud platforms, my
students and I will experiment with connecting Integrated Genome Browser to storage and visual
analytics computing capability exceeding what is possible to achieve on a single, desktop computer.
These advanced features within IGB will help move the entire field forward by demonstrating how
application developers can harness the power of the cloud for visualizing data. Second, I will continue to
build IGB and related tools into a platform that other developers can exploit and learn from. The field of
genomics changes rapidly. As new methods and tools come on-line, developers need ways to create
new visualization tools suited to these new methods. My research aims to provide a platform for
experimentation that will enable developers in bioinformatics to build and release new visual analytics
algorithms more rapidly to larger numbers of potential users. My group will continue to develop and
support an App Store for IGB, an on-line clearinghouse for developers to distribute Apps and for users to
find and install Apps relevant to their research. To support developers, we will continue to improve IGB’s
internal application programmer’s interface (API), a collection of methods and classes crafted to enable
developers of varying skill and knowledge to add new functions and features to the IGB interface. Third,
my students and I will continue to explore larger concepts of community, open source software

Signal transduction in development and disease (PI: Rohatgi)
The goals of my research program are to uncover new regulatory mechanisms in cell-cell communication
pathways, to understand how these mechanisms are damaged in disease states, and to devise new strategies
to repair their function. Over the last 4.5 years, funding from the NIGMS has supported 23 publications across
four different research areas in my laboratory: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, WNT signaling, drug resistance
mechanisms and intrinsically disordered proteins. Trainees involved in MIRA-supported research have won
competitive fellowships (including a K99/R00 award from the NIGMS) and obtained independent group leader
positions in both academia and industry. The next project period will tackle major unsolved problems in the
vertebrate Hh and WNT signaling systems, two iconic cell-cell communication pathways that coordinate the
construction of tissues during development and their subsequent maintenance throughout adult life. Despite the
importance of these pathways in human diseases ranging from birth defects to cancer and degenerative
conditions, many steps in Hh and WNT signaling remain poorly understood at the biochemical and cell biological
level. In the Hh pathway, our focus is on understanding how a signal is detected at the cell surface and
transmitted across the plasma membrane to transcriptional effectors in the cytoplasm. These signaling steps in
the vertebrate Hh pathway depend on primary cilia, antenna-like organelles that project from the surfaces of
most cells and are implicated in human birth defect syndromes called “ciliopathies.” Major questions under
investigation include (1) how Patched 1 (PTCH1), the receptor for Hh ligands, regulates the function of
Smoothened (SMO), the protein that transmits the signal across the membrane, (2) how SMO is activated at
primary cilia and (3) how SMO signals to the Glioblastoma (GLI) family of transcription factors. Our MIRA-
supported work has led to a new paradigm in transmembrane signaling: the use of cholesterol accessibility in
the ciliary membrane as a second messenger to communicate the signal between PTCH1 and SMO. Our focus
in the WNT pathway is on the multi-protein β-catenin destruction complex that suppresses WNT signaling by
promoting the degradation of β-catenin. Defects in this complex drive the vast majority of colorectal cancer, a
disease with an increasing burden (especially amongst people <50 years of age) predicted to cause over 1
million deaths yearly by 2030. Our emphasis is on uncovering differences in the genetic and biochemical
requirements for oncogenic (mutation-driven) and physiological (ligand-driven) WNT signaling, since any
successful anti-WNT drug will have to distinguish between the two to achieve an acceptable therapeutic index.
Our work is supported by long-term collaborations and embraces a broad range of techniques that span structural
biology, lipid biochemistry, CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens and microscopy. The successful completion of
this project will provide a deep mechanistic understanding of these fundamental cell-cell communication systems
and new strategies to monitor and modulate these pathways in human diseases."

Here we propose to advance the goal of NHGRI to implement genomic medicine and focus on individuals
who have not been able to afford DNA testing. The research takes place in the Department of Molecular and
Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Childrens Hospital (TCH). Our team of
clinicians, geneticists, computer scientists, genomicists and model organism researchers has had a five-year
term of success with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Model Organisms Screening Center (MOSC).
This has included successfully identifying a number of new disease genes such as EBF3, IRF2BPL, NACC1,
TBX2, TOMM70, CDK19, ACOX1, WDR37, and ATP5F1D. We propose to recruit 100 individuals from an
underserved population in Houston, Texas with suspected rare disease and without the means to pay for
DNA sequencing through insurance. We will provide whole-exome sequencing which will generate a CAP/CLIA
report that we anticipate could diagnose 35-40 individuals per year. The remaining individuals will then be
converted to a family-based trio exome design. All the sequencing costs of this project will be covered by
philanthrophic donation to our hospital and are not budgeted to the grant. We will make every effort to
diagnose the remaining 60 individuals per year through machine learning and informatics using the MARRVEL
platform, Drosophila functional studies of candidate genes and through ongoing 6 month, 12 month and 2 year
follow-up with the patients where we will use matchmaking efforts such as GeneMatcher and Matchmaker
exchange as well as our own genomic databases from the UDN and other studies to come to a genetic
diagnosis. All subjects will receive genetic counseling from a trained team and will provide us with valuable
medical, psychological and social data to guide how genomic implementation in an underserved population
is perceived, impacts care and impacts the family. This work will not only produce novel insights into rare
disease, diagnosis for undiagnosed families and an expanded role for genomics, it will guide us in the future
to provide genomics and functional research to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay."

The APOBEC3 (A3) family of proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that suppress human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by hypermutation of viral reverse transcripts and physically
blocking reverse transcription. To evade this host defense mechanism, HIV-1 expresses the virion infectivity
factor (Vif), which hijacks a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targets A3 proteins (A3F/G/H/D) for
proteasome-mediated degradation. Besides degrading A3s, HIV-1 Vif also causes G2 cell cycle arrest by
targeting multiple protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulators (PPP2R5 proteins) for degradation. Adding to the
complexity of Vif-host protein interactions, HIV-1 Vif utilizes the transcription factor CBFβ as a non-canonical
cofactor, while maedi-visna virus (MVV) Vif co-opts the prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) instead. Our goal
is to establish the biochemical and structural principles for the multifaceted activities of lentiviral Vif molecules
that recruit cellular factors to degrade host proteins via ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. To achieve our goal,
we will use a combination of biochemical, biophysical, structural biology, and cellular functional techniques. To
establish the mechanisms by which A3 proteins are targeted by the HIV-1 Vif (Aim1), we will determine high-
resolution structures of the A3-Vif-E3 interaction complexes, validate these structures by structure-guided
mutagenesis experiments in vitro and in vivo, and interrogate the molecular determinants of Vif/A3/E3 ligase
assembly and activation. In addition, we will also study the degradation-independent mode of Vif inhibition of
A3 deamination and antiviral activities. To better understand CypA-mediated formation of MVV Vif-E3 ubiquitin
ligase (Aim2), we will assemble MVV Vif/CypA/E3 ligase complexes with or without A3 substrates, determine
their high-resolution structures, and perform biochemical and functional validations of our structural
observations. The influences of capsid proteins on the assembly and activation of MVV Vif-E3 ligase will also
be investigated. To delineate the mechanisms of PPP2R5/PP2A recruitment by lentiviral Vif-E3 ubiquitin
ligases (Aim3), we will investigate the effects of PPP2R5 proteins on the assemblies of the CBFβ-mediated
HIV-1 Vif and CypA-mediated MVV Vif-E3 ligases, obtain high-resolution structures, and perform structure-
guided validations. Our comprehensive research design provides a robust approach that will generate
unprecedented insights into the diverse functions of lentiviral Vif molecules."
10876398,"SUMMARY
 Mitochondria have numerous signaling pathways for conveying stress to the rest of a cell. Similar to
pathogens that release pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), mitochondria release novel
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including lipids, peptides, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
that indicate mitochondrial stress. Mitochondrial double-stranded RNA (mtdsRNA) is a new class of DAMPs
that is generated when the noncoding strand in mtRNA is not degraded efficiently and accumulates, allowing
base-pairing with the coding strand. Under normal conditions, the helicase SUV3 unwinds the mtRNAs and
polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)ndegrades them. However, knockdown of SUV3 results in the
accumulation of mtdsRNAs within mitochondria, and knockdown of PNPase leads to the release of the
mtdsRNAs into the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, the mtdsRNAs are sensed by dsRNA sensors MDA5 and
RIG-I, leading to the induction of the type I interferon pathway. The export of mtdsRNA is likely important as
mtdsRNAs have been identified in the cytosol of patients with mutations in PNPT1, encoding PNPase, and in
diseases including cancer, cardiac disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, and autoimmune diseases.
 The hypothesis that mtdsRNAs represent a new biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction will be tested.
As this is a new pathway, there is a critical gap in understanding the molecular rules and mechanisms by which
mtdsRNAs cross the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes for cytosolic export. Our study goals are
contained within three independent, but thematically connected, specific aims. In Aim 1, mtdsRNAs that are
exported from mitochondria will be characterized with respect to size and sequence specificity. In addition,
RNA modifying enzymes will be tested to determine which components are essential for the generation of
mtdsRNAs. Aim 2 will focus on identification of outer and inner membrane channels and the role of PNPase in
the trafficking of mtdsRNAs out of mitochondria. The third aim will define physiologic parameters that lead to
the generation of mtdsRNAs and determination of the cytosolic dsRNA sensors that become activated during
this process. Because mutations in PNPase lead to mitochondrial disease, mutants will be characterized to
determine whether steps in the degradation and/or export of mtdsRNAs can be separated.
 Our study team has been characterizing PNPase and its function in mitochondria extensively. Unique
model systems available for our work include a mouse model in which floxxed PNPT1 can be removed by the
Cre recombinase, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from this model. Results from this proposal will
define the pathway for mtdsRNA trafficking out of mitochondria in detail and provide a platform for
understanding how mutations in PNPase contribute to disease. Long-term, these studies may lead to
establishing mtdsRNA as a new biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction."
10906741,"Heart transplantation (HTx) is the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure, but its use is limited by the
availability of donor hearts. As a result, a substantial number of HTx candidates die awaiting transplant.
Donation after circulatory death (DCD) offers a promising additional source for HTx. However, its adoption is
hindered due to obligatory warm ischemic injury during death process and subsequent reperfusion injury, as
well as unsuitable preservation modality during transport. The EVHP provides normothermic perfusion platform
for satisfactory preservation of DCD hearts and offers the possibility to deliver therapeutic agents that improve
resuscitation of DCD hearts prior to transplantation. Given stem cell-derived paracrine protection following
myocardial ischemia, our goal is to determine potential efficacy of post-ischemic administration of stem cell
secretions (conditioned medium [CM], extracellular vesicles [EVs], or engineered EVs) using the EVHP on
recovery of DCD hearts prior to transplantation, thereby increasing the number of available donor hearts. Our
recent studies have reported that adding MSC-CM or MSC-EVs to storage solution protected heart graft
performance after 6h-cold storage using an in vivo mouse HTx model and MSC-CM restored cold ischemia-
impaired cardiac transcriptome profile. These results suggest therapeutic potential of MSC secretions on donor
heart preservation. Our published work and preliminary data have also shown: 1) using human MSCs or their
CM improved heart functional recovery in the EVHP following acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R); 2) MSC-CM
prevented mitochondrial damage in donor hearts from cold ischemia and restored clock gene period 2 (Per2,
with a role in mitochondrial metabolic regulation); 3) warm ischemia resulted in abnormal mitochondrial
structure in mouse and human DCD hearts, with decreased Per2, and 4) Per2 knockdown worsened
mitochondrial injury and abolished MSC CM-mediated mitochondrial preservation in myocytes during stress.
Collectively, we hypothesize that post-ischemic administration of MSC secretions using the EVHP ameliorates
warm ischemia-induced functional deterioration of DCD hearts via Per2-elicited mitochondrial improvement.
We expect that a novel approach using the engineered EVs to deliver Per2 will promote mitochondrial
recovery and myocardial resuscitation in DCD hearts. We propose two aims: 1. test the hypothesis that ex vivo
application of MSC secretions using the EVHP ameliorates warm ischemia-induced myocardial damage via
mitochondrial preservation in DCD hearts; and 2. determine the role of Per2 in improving mitochondrial
performance in DCD hearts and demonstrate beneficial effects of Per2-loaded MSC-EVs on resuscitation of
DCD hearts. The translational potential of MSC-derived therapy and the engineered EVs will also be assessed
in human-like porcine DCD hearts. The results from this study can provide foundation for potential clinical trials
in that MSC secretions can be utilized to improve DCD heart recovery and help us gain mechanistic insights on
therapeutic targets to limit warm ischemic injury in DCD hearts for transplantation."

 Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is a key factor that promotes poor host defense, pro-thrombotic
cardiovascular complications and bleeding during respiratory viral infections. The applicant’s laboratory has
made long-standing contributions in vascular effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a circulating lipid
mediator important for EC resilience. This protective pathway is preferentially activated by HDL-bound S1P, thus
counteracting EC dysfunction and pathophysiology. However, the role of S1P in influenza viral infections in the
context of thrombosis and bleeding complications is poorly understood. This proposal develops a novel paradigm
to enhance vascular resilience while minimizing thrombotic and bleeding complications during virus-induced
pulmonary injury. We have developed designer HDL-like nanoparticles that chaperone S1P, namely, ApoA1-
ApoM (A1M)/S1P, for therapeutic activation of EC S1PR1 and suppression of vascular leak. A1M/S1P either
alone or together with other barrier protective agents such as angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2)
enhanced EC barrier function in endothelial cells. In addition, the ApoA1 moiety of A1M suppressed cytokine-
induced NFkB activation and inflammatory gene expression. We hypothesize that sustained activation of
S1PR1/Gi signaling by HDL-S1P and cooperative interactions between EC protective pathways (ANGPT1/
Tie2 and PGI2/IP receptor) enhances pulmonary vascular recovery from respiratory viral infections
without inducing prothrombotic transformation of the endothelium. Specific aim 1 will evaluate HDL-S1P
activation of protective endothelial S1PR1/Gi signaling. Genetic mouse models of S1PR1 loss of function (EC
knockout), gain of function (EC transgenic) and Gi-biased signaling (S5A phosphorylation-defective mutant),
Apom KO or Apom TG mice will be analyzed to determine alveolar microvascular leak, integrity, thrombosis,
bleeding and resolution of inflammation during influenza virus-induced pneumonitis. Single cell (sc)RNA-seq
data from mice with viral pneumonitis will be deconvoluted to determine molecular mechanisms of paracrine
signal networks between EC and pericytes important in microvascular resilience. The second aim will determine
the mechanisms by which albumin-S1P/S1PR1 signaling in EC promotes thrombosis in the context of viral
infection. We will use Tie2 agonists together with EC-targeted S1PR1 agonists to control bleeding in the setting
of influenza infection. The third aim will develop combinatorial therapeutic approaches containing novel HDL-like
nanoparticles and Tie2 activators to suppress EC injury and thromboinflammation during viral host defense
responses. Designer HDL particles containing S1P that enhances the vascular resilience and HDL particles that
carry stable prostacyclin (PGI2) analogs will be combined with Tie2 activators to suppress thrombosis and
bleeding in lung on chip and mouse models. Together, this proposal aims to achieve a mechanistic
understanding of EC pathophysiology during respiratory viral infections and develop novel therapeutic strategies."
10891352,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Psychosocial stress is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, current
cardiovascular risk management strategies include few evidence-based interventions to address
psychosocial stress’s detrimental effects on this disease. With the current global events, notably the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing burden of atherosclerotic heart disease, modulating
stress’ effects is warranted. The goal of our current proposal is mechanistically understanding psychosocial
stress’s impact on the immune system and inflammatory atherosclerosis to lower residual cardiovascular
risk in patients.
 Over the course of our Type-1 Program, we substantially contributed to knowledge about the links
between psychosocial stress and cardiovascular disease by identifying tissular, cellular, and molecular
pathways that connect nervous, immune, and vascular systems. Specifically, we found that stress
perception mechanisms influence atherosclerosis development and regression. We developed
sophisticated tools to study specific brain regions and their contributions to stress perception. We made
substantial progress on translational imaging studies in atherosclerosis. In clinical studies, we are gaining
ground on understanding the neuro-immune-arterial pathway.
 Our collaborative efforts to studying how stress affects the immune system have yielded new,
innovative research questions we are now eager to explore. Drawing on our Type-1 Program, in the current
proposal, we will not merely investigate macrophage biology; we will broaden our scope to acquire a
complete picture of immune reprogramming in psychosocial stress-aggravated atherosclerotic disease. Our
Program’s broader perspective includes more expansively evaluating different brain circuits and employing
a wide variety of imaging methods while pursuing more in-depth analyses (omics) and optimal data
integration. This innovative approach will elevate our understanding of the complex interrelation between
stress perception and cardiovascular immunology, simultaneously extending the Program’s clinical scope.
 We will approach this highly innovative program with our multidisciplinary team including the
previous program’s principal investigators, most of its key investigators, as well as new collaborators in
neuroscience, psychiatry, and trained immunity. Our program will yield critical insights into how stress-
induced immune reprogramming exacerbates (ongoing) cardiovascular disease. Its successful completion
will not only lay the foundation for unique (i) scientific insights into immune mechanisms that are regulated
neurologically and drive cardiovascular disease development but also yield (ii) a forward-thinking approach
to managing cardiovascular disease in individuals experiencing prolonged episodes of psychosocial stress
and identify novel (iii) therapeutic targets and treatments."
10825596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proteasome inhibitors are currently being used in the clinic against Multiple myeloma. This
approach is thought to work at least in part because cancer cells appear to rely more heavily on
proteasomes than do normal cells. However, our previous studies showed that proteasome
inhibition invokes an adaptive program driven by the transcription factor NRF1 which
upregulates proteasome genes resulting in the recovery of proteasome activity, thus limiting the
efficacy of this approach. Consistent with this notion, our preliminary data suggest that
depletion of NRF1 potentiates the action of proteasome inhibition therapy in a breast cancer
xenograft model. Taking advantage of the fact that a protease DDI2 is essential for NRF1
activation, here we propose to identify small molecule inhibitors of this protease that could be
used to enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, based on our preliminary data
that showed depleting DDI2 in itself retards tumor growth, DDI2 inhibitors could also find use as
a single-agent. Based on our pilot screen that demonstrates feasibility and consistent with the
goals of PAR-20-271, this 4-year project will pursue the following specific aims. In AIM 1, we
will express and purify DDI2 protein and perform high-throughput screens using a protein
thermal shift (PTS) assay to identify compounds that bind DDI2. In AIM 2, we will perform hit
selection, confirmation and profiling using a panel of secondary assays that includes orthogonal
and counter-screen assays as well as biophysical assays. In AIM 3, we will perform hit
validation, hit expansion, probe selection and profile the mechanism of action of hits, followed
by cellular assays to assess DDI2 target engagement, impact on the DDI2-NRF1 axis and
cancer cell apoptosis."
10838477,"Project Summary/Abstract
For this application, “Studying the Genetics of Aging, Behavioral, and Social Phenotypes in Diverse Populations,”
we propose to develop tools to promote genetic research of aging, behavioral, and social phenotypes in
diverse populations. These phenotypes have a number of unique characteristics (e.g., polygenicity,
environmental mechanisms, and small effect sizes) which require special consideration when developing
research tools. In brief, we propose to:
 • Develop the Genetic-Related-Matrix-Matched Association study (GRMMA) tool for performing
 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in large, diverse data sets. Current GWAS methods require
 restricting samples into approximately homogeneous-ancestry samples, which is wasteful and has
 resulted in Eurocentric bias in genetics research. Using matching methods, GRMMA can use more of the
 available data in a way that both reduces bias and increases statistical power. We will employ
 computationally efficient strategies that allow us to implement GRMMA in large diverse sample such as
 the UK Biobank. We will make the GRMMA tool and tutorials publicly available through the online
 repository, Github.
 • Develop SBayes-Universal (SBayesU), an efficient new tool for producing polygenic scores (PGSs) by
 optimally combining GWAS summary statistics estimated in different populations. The key feature of
 SBayesU is that it uses a low-dimensional eigen decomposition of the linkage disequilibrium matrix.
 This permits SBayesU to model a much larger set of SNPs, to model SNP annotations, to account for
 imperfect cross-ancestry genetic correlation, to produce PGSs for populations that are not included
 among the sets of GWAS summary statistics, and to allow our algorithms to converge much more
 quickly and reliably. We will also make the SBayesU tool and tutorials publicly available.
 • We will apply the best available method for producing diverse-population PGSs (which we anticipate
 will be SBayesU) to a wide range of aging, behavioral, and social phenotypes, using existing cohorts and
 new genotyped data that becomes available during the grant period. We will make the polygenic scores
 we produce publicly available as part of the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium’s Polygenic
 Index Repository, which currently creates polygenic scores for 11 widely used datasets (but currently
 only for the European-ancestry individuals in those datasets). Each release of the Repository will be
 accompanied by documentation that clearly describes methods used and the underlying data."
10773171,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the wake of a global pandemic caused by the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, infections with emerging variant
strains are an ongoing cause of morbidity and mortality. Robust respiratory mucosal immune responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination are vital to prevent re-infection and complications of emerging variant
strains. Children with poorly controlled, Th2-mediated asthma treated with high-dose corticosteroids are an
important at-risk population for hospitalization with variant strains of SARS-CoV-2, often in association with
seasonal respiratory viral co-infections. Although children mount durable systemic adaptive immune responses
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination, very little is known as to whether Th2 inflammation present in the
lungs of many children with asthma dysregulates the lower respiratory mucosal adaptive immune response to
the ancestral virus and its variant strains. Therefore, the broad goal of this proposal is to examine blood and
lower respiratory adaptive mucosal immune signatures, including spike (S) and receptor-binding domain (RBD)
antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and T and B cell responses to previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 and
variant strains (Specific Aim One) and/or mRNA vaccination (Specific Aim Two) in children with asthma and
healthy controls. We will furthermore interrogate significant determinants of humoral and T cell adaptive immune
response variables with generalized linear models to identify those determinants which most inform adaptive
responses. To further examine mechanisms of allergen-induced inflammation on adaptive immunity to SARS-
CoV-2 and variants in the blood and lungs, we will (Specific Aim Three) infect juvenile K18-hACE2 mice
sensitized to house dust mite in the presence and absence of corticosteroid treatment and mRNA vaccination.
New knowledge from these studies should increase the understanding of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2
infection and/or vaccination in children in a way to advance anti-viral treatment, isolation measures, and
development of novel booster vaccines targeting mucosal immunity. We are prepared to accomplish these aims
through an established team of investigators with experience in childhood asthma and bronchoscopy, in
partnership with immunologists with expertise in the investigation of respiratory mucosal immunity to SARS-CoV-
2 infection and mRNA vaccination."
10868497,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) is a progressive, fatal
neurodegenerative disease that results from the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, as well as neurons of
the frontal cortex. The resulting symptoms of ALS-FTD are progressive motor and cognitive impairment. Little is
known about the underlying mechanism of disease, and there are no effective treatments that significantly
lengthen lifespan. 10% of ALS-FTD cases show a familial pattern of inheritance and can often be traced to
mutation of specific genes. Familial ALS-FTD (fALS-FTD) shares key features with sporadic ALS-FTD, meaning
that the study of fALS-FTD can provide broadly applicable findings in the fight against this devastating disease.
 Mutations in the human UBQLN2 gene lead to a portion of fALS-FTD cases, but the mechanism of
disease is poorly understood. UBQLNs are a family of proteasome shuttle factors which facilitate proteasomal
degradation of ‘difficult’ proteasome substrates, though the identity of these substrates has been elusive. We
recently published that UBQLN2 regulates proteasomal degradation of the protein PEG10. PEG10, or ‘paternally
expressed gene 10’, is a ‘domesticated retrotransposon’: it resembles retrotransposons and retroviruses in its
overall structure, but is unable to transpose within the genome. Like its viral cousins, the PEG10 protein contains
a nucleic-acid binding zinc finger and a protease domain, both with unknown function. We recently discovered
that PEG10 is an active self-protease and releases a protein fragment containing the nucleic acid-binding region
which then traffics to the nucleus. Expression of this fragment alone is sufficient to upregulate expression of
genes involved in axon remodeling, which are similarly upregulated in ALS-FTD tissues. Therefore, PEG10 is
an excellent candidate for the molecular cause of ALS-FTD upon UBQLN2 dysfunction. In our model, UBQLN2
loss or dysfunction leads to PEG10 accumulation, increased liberation of the nucleic acid-binding fragment, and
upregulated axon remodeling genes, leading to phenotypes of disease. This proposal seeks to validate and
explore our new model of disease in depth with a complement of in vitro and in vivo approaches.
 Our goals for the next five years are to generate a deep understanding of the UBQLN2-PEG10
relationship and how it influences the development of ALS-FTD. In our first Aim, we carefully examine the
abundance and proteolytic activity of PEG10 in ALS and FTD patient tissue. In our second Aim, we determine
the mechanism and precise contribution of PEG10 in cellular and animal models of UBQLN2-mediated disease.
Finally, we dive deeply into the molecular underpinnings of UBQLN2-PEG10 interactions in order to generate
the first detailed model for UBQLN client selection. The findings from our research program will transform our
basic understanding of PEG10 function as well as UBQLN2 biology, and may provide crucial new targets for the
fight against ALS-FTD."
10793554,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common brain tumor malignancy in adults that is characterized by unique
niches termed pseudo-palisading necrosis. These hypoxic regions are a defining feature of the disease which
promote chemoresistance, radioresistance, and ultimately drive disease progression. Understanding the
generation and sustainment of these regions is critical to understanding how to effectively treat the disease.
Multi-omics analysis of human GBM patients reveals that the creatine transporter, Slc6a8 is specifically
expressed by tumor cells in hypoxic and necrotic regions. Surrounding these regions are tumor-associated
myeloid cells (TAMCs), which are the most abundant infiltrating immune cell in GBM. Surprisingly, the TAMCs
that surround the hypoxic pseudo-palisading regions express the enzymes necessary to produce creatine.
Therefore, we hypothesize that TAMC-derived creatine promotes the generation of the pseudo-palisading
necrotic niche in GBM, and that this metabolic crosstalk promotes both GBM fitness and therapy resistance.
 Previous work has identified that the hypoxic pseudo-palisading niche contains glioma stem cells (GSC),
which are generated by the hypoxic stress within these regions. Furthermore, Slc6a8 is directly regulated by
hypoxia, suggesting creatine uptake exerts a role on GSC phenotypes. Thus, the first aim of this proposal is to
examine how creatine transport influences GSC phenotypes in both human and mouse models of GBM. In this
aim, we will also utilize inducible models of GBM that recapitulate the genetic and pathologic features of human
GBM to determine if Slc6a8 is necessary for the formation of the hypoxic pseudo-palisading niche in tumors.
 Our preliminary data indicate that TAMCs isolated from both mice and humans with GBM are proficient
producers of creatine. Furthermore, we found that this metabolic phenotype is specific to the tumor
microenvironment (TME) and is induced by extracellular lactate. Thus, the second aim of this proposal will
examine how the ablation of creatine biosynthesis by TAMCs controls tumor growth and progression in mouse
models of GBM. This aim will also determine how lactate induces the creatine biosynthetic phenotype of TAMCs
in GBM.
 The third aim of this proposal is to examine if a clinically relevant inhibitor of creatine transport influences
GBM growth. We will test how this inhibitor works in the context of chemo and radiotherapy to determine how
creatine uptake influences GBM recurrence. To establish translatable value from this work, we will generate
tumor samples and patient-derived xenografts from patients, screen them for expression of creatine metabolic
genes, then assess sensitivity to creatine metabolic inhibitory therapy. The results of this aim will identify if
blocking TAMC-to-tumor metabolic communication is a feasible strategy for GBM therapy."
10647625,"Background: VA Community Living Center (CLC) staff struggle to address behavioral and neuropsychiatric
symptoms of Veterans with dementia and serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia. These behaviors
of distress (agitation, aggression, and mood disturbance) are not just associated with staff stress and burnout;
they also hasten residents’ functional decline, decrease quality of life, and increase mortality. Staff training in
non-pharmacological interventions can be effective. Yet systems barriers, task-based traditional biomedical
care models, and time constraints often result in staff employing “quicker,” less effective strategies.
Montessori Approaches to Person-Centered Care for VA (MAP-VA)— a staff training, intervention, and
delivery toolkit— developed in collaboration with VA operational partners, Veterans, and frontline CLC staff is
positioned to respond to this challenge. Our pilot data show probable impacts on CLC quality indicators at the
individual and unit level (e.g., psychotropic medications, depressive symptoms, weight loss, falls, pain).
Significance / Impact: Intense media scrutiny focused on care quality in VA CLCs has created an urgent
problem for VA over the past year. To restore perceived trust, safety, and quality— as described in VHA’s
Modernization Plan— frontline staff need to be empowered to lead quality improvement efforts like the ones
taught through MAP-VA.
Innovation: MAP-VA is distinct from existing interventions in its: 1) application to Veterans with a range of
diagnoses and cognitive abilities; 2) emphasis on pairing practical skill-building for staff with overcoming
system-level barriers that inhibit person-centered care; and 3) engagement of all staff rather than a reliance on
provider-level champions. Yet, MAP-VA is a complex intervention that requires participation of multiple
stakeholder groups, making implementation facilitation necessary. To date, no studies have evaluated MAP
implementation success in operational settings (community or VA) and sustainability is rarely examined.
Specific Aims: A hybrid (Type 3) implementation-effectiveness study is necessary to evaluate MAP-VA for
Veterans and staff in CLCs. Study Aims include: 1) evaluate implementation facilitation and identify barriers to
MAP-VA adoption and fidelity; 2) determine effectiveness of MAP-VA implementation on resident behavioral,
emotional, and physical health outcomes; 3) determine effectiveness of MAP-VA implementation on person-
centered care practices and organizational culture; and 4) examine the extent to which MAP-VA is sustained
after external facilitation support has ended.
Methodology: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate within- and
between-cluster implementation success and treatment effects over 18 months. Eight CLCs (24 CLC
neighborhoods) will be randomized to a sequential crossover to the intervention with six months of facilitation.
Analyses will account for time trends and correlations within cluster. Normalization process theory and the RE-
AIM evaluation framework will guide the implementation evaluation and integration of qualitative and
quantitative data. Data sources include primary data collection (e.g., resident interviews, staff interviews,
surveys, researcher observation) and existing VA administrative data (e.g., Minimum Data Set 3.0, pharmacy,
disruptive behavior reporting system, annual employee survey).
Implementation / Next Steps: Our partners in the VA Offices of Geriatrics and Extended Care, Nursing
Services, Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, and Recreation Therapy are enthusiastic about using MAP-
VA to improve Veteran-centered care, care quality, and staff engagement within and beyond the CLCs.
Outcomes from this work will be applicable to supporting staff and improving quality for complex aging
Veterans across the continuum of care (e.g., Home Based Primary Care)."
11026710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Our understanding of human intestinal development is limited by a lack of tissue accessibility and
limitations to existing benchtop models. These laboratory models have advanced with the emergence of
organoids, which can better recapitulate the cellular composition and spatial organization of tissue-specific cells
than classical in vitro models. Further, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs)
are particularly relevant in modeling human intestinal development. However, state-of-the-art protocols fail to
account for all relevant niche cues that may influence cell fate, maturation, and morphogenesis, yielding
organoids with an immature (i.e., fetal-like) gene signature that limits their relevancy in modeling human disease.
Crucially, the timing of exposure to niche cues is vital for proper fate specification. Additionally, we hypothesize
that niche cues, beyond the traditionally studied soluble biochemical factors, namely the dynamic properties of
the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), can and will alter cell signaling and subsequent changes to cell fate.
We propose to use a reductionist approach to study the role of the ECM on HIO-derived epithelial organoids
(HDEs) and design “blank-slate” biomaterials to precisely and specifically match the properties of the niche that
are amenable to organoid growth, then globally and locally alter these properties to understand their role in cell
fate decisions, maturation state, and the generation of biomimetic intestinal crypt-villus architecture. We posit
that by using advanced imaging techniques, including expansion microscopy and metabolic labeling of nascent
proteins, we will be able to further characterize how the ECM changes globally and locally as HDEs grow. In Aim
1, we will investigate how phototunable changes to matrix stiffness (by controlled softening or stiffening) change
HDE cellular composition and maturation state over time. In Aim 2, we will spatiotemporally alter local matrix
mechanics by photoinduced matrix softening to coax architectural changes to growing HDEs to match in vivo
crypt dimensions. We will then study how these changes influence cell fate and maturation. In the K99 phase of
the award, Prof. Kristi Anseth, a luminary in using dynamic PEG-based hydrogel materials for manipulating
cellular phenotypes, and Prof. Peter Dempsey, a world-leading expert in intestinal biology, will serve as my co-
mentors. I will consult my mentoring team, including Prof. Jason Spence (iPSC-derived organoids, scRNA-seq),
Prof. Richard Benninger (imaging and image analysis), Dr. Joseph Dragavon (imaging and image analysis), and
Prof. Jay Hesselberth (scRNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis). My K99 training will consist of learning key iPSC-
derived organoid techniques, advanced imaging and image analysis methods, and scRNA-seq analysis and
interpretation to propel me towards developing better models of human development to understand the role ECM
niche cues during the independent investigator R00 phase. In sum, the proposed research will address an unmet
need to specifically study the role of the ECM in intestinal development and controllably tune properties of the
ECM to build better models of the intestine towards improved translational efficacy in future studies."
10876395,"Candida albicans exists as a commensal yeast in healthy people while it can cause mucosal and systemic
fungal infections including oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in immunocompromised individuals and diabetics.
C. albicans has the ability to sense environmental iron as a signal with the help of its signaling pathways, such
as Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Cek1, to modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic iron
levels. Recent evidence has shed light on the role of different iron levels between free iron rich gut and free
iron deplete blood, allowing C. albicans to choose between a commensal or virulent lifestyle in these
respective niches. Nothing is known about how variations in iron levels within the oral cavity will influence
virulence during OPC. Our preliminary data shows that iron chelation in murine OPC causes significant
reduction in virulence, while iron supplementation leads to greater fungal load in the tongue tissue of the
infected mice. We also show how iron communicated with various signaling pathways including C. albicans
MAPK Cek1 to modulate the fungal cell wall (CW), thereby affecting response to antifungals (by changing CW
component levels) and host immune attack (by affecting exposure of immunogenic β-glucan in the CW). The
main goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms behind iron-mediated changes in C. albicans CW
that in turn effect the outcome of infection during OPC. Besides, in vitro experiments to address this goal, we
will use our murine OPC model and mice will be repleted or depleted in systemic iron levels with iron
supplementation (with iron dextran) and iron chelation (with iron chelator Deferasirox), respectively. We will
also study mucosal colonization by C. albicans in Caenorhabditis elegans worms with human-like iron
disorders, to evaluate fitness of fungal virulence traits directly in host with varying iron levels. Our overall
hypothesis is that iron communicates with various signaling pathways to modulate fungal CW, in turn affecting
hyphal morphogenesis, drug sensitivity, and susceptibility to host immune response, in OPC. We will test our
hypothesis using three specific aims: 1) Define iron-induced signaling mechanisms that modulate C. albicans
β-glucan exposure, levels of CW components, and hyphal morphogenesis, 2) Determine how iron affects C.
albicans CW remodeling and hyphal morphogenesis during murine OPC to impact antifungal drug
susceptibility, and 3) Evaluate how changes in host iron levels modulate innate immune defense mechanisms
against C. albicans in vitro, during murine OPC, and in C. elegans. This work will provide insights into how
varying iron levels in susceptible populations will affect the outcome of C. albicans infection during OPC."

Candidate: During my training, I have been highly motivated to understand how cytotoxic lymphocytes can be
used as an adoptive therapy and how immune cells are regulated during immunotherapy. I have served as first,
co-, and corresponding author on numerous high-impact original research articles, representing advances in
basic, translational, and clinical immunology. I have successfully competed for career development awards that
have allowed me to continue my research interests. My long-term research goals are to understand the
mechanisms important for NK cell effector functions, how NK cells contribute to and are impacted by
immunomodulation and how host immune responses can promote or limit their NK cells as an effective cellular
therapy in human and murine systems.
Research Career Development Plan: As I begin my independent research program, I will utilize educational
and research resources aimed specifically at junior faculty at Washington University to strengthen my career
development. While I have the scientific training and expertise to perform the proposed studies, I will utilize the
opportunities at WUSM to prepare for my tenure-track position. Specifically, aspects of management,
mentorship, and the learning the administrative responsibilities of running a research laboratory (animal
protocols, institutional approvals, budget management).
Research Project: The long-term goal of this project is to improve our understanding of mechanisms operative
in the successes and failures of innate immune therapy. Memory-like NK cells were first identified in mice over
a decade ago and studies examining their persistence, anti-tumor responses, and metabolic adaptations to the
tumor microenvironment have laid the groundwork for both the human trials currently open to enrollment and the
studies proposed herein. One current barrier in the field is translating these novel immune approaches which
have had so much success in treating hematologic malignancies into successes treating solid tumors. We
hypothesize that ML NK cell differentiation combined with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-targeting will improve
NK cell trafficking, effector responses, and fitness in both allogeneic and autologous immunotherapeutic
paradigms. We will evaluate this concept against cancer and infection. These studies may reveal novel strategies
or therapeutic interventions for NK-cell based therapies that will likely be broadly relevant to other cellular
therapies. Completion of these studies will lay the scientific groundwork for both future R01 applications and for
a successful career studying the interactions of adoptive cell therapy and the host immune system."
10875505,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 37 million people worldwide are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combined
antiretroviral therapy (ART) has turned HIV into a chronic infection with significantly longer life expectancy.
New health issues have surfaced as HIV patients live longer. Specifically, 50% of HIV-infected (HIV+)
individuals exhibit neurocognitive impairment, termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). A key
event leading to HAND is persistent low-level chronic inflammation resulting in neuronal damage and cell
death. A major contributor to HIV-induced neuroinflammation is activated monocytes, which are significantly
elevated in patients’ with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). A hallmark of HIV infection is chronic, systemic
inflammation in part through translocation of microbial derived products from the gut which, activates
monocytes and promote migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Upon entry, activated monocytes
release neurotoxic and proinflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1), which are thought to contribute to HAND.
Recently, evidence has emerged implicating the importance of inflammasome activation as a contributing
mechanism to neuroinflammation and HAND. Preliminary results presented in this application show that
inflammasome activation in monocytes, as evidenced by IL-1 secretion, promotes astroglial cell inflammation.
These findings support a critical role for inflammasome activation in monocytes as a mechanism driving
neuroinflammation. In particular, immunohistocytochemistry of brain tissue from post-mortem HIV patients with
HAD showed significant infiltration of proinflammatory CD16+ monocytes. By contrast, cannabinoid exposure
displays anti-inflammatory properties in HIV-infected patients, which we and others have reported. The anti-
inflammatory properties of cannabis are attributed largely to the canonical ligand, ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), which exerts psychotropic activity through cannabinoid receptor (CB) 1 and the non-psychotropic-
mediating CB2, while cannabidiol (CBD) does not act through CB1/CB2. Likewise, the CB2 selective agonist,
JWH-015, represents a potential strategy for understanding the role of CB2 in limiting HIV-associated
neuroinflammation. In fact, preliminary results demonstrate that a CB2 selective agonist impairs monocyte
secretion of IL-1, a hallmark of inflammation and inflammasome activation. Mechanistic studies are proposed
to test the hypothesis: CD16+ monocytes from non-cannabis using HIV+ subjects exhibit greater
inflammasome formation and subsequent astrocyte activation compared to cannabis using HIV+ subjects,
which is associated with the frequency of cannabis use."

The long range goals of our research program has been to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which metabolic states
and 17β-estradiol (E2) regulate arcuate nucleus kisspeptin (Kiss1ARH) neuronal circuits that are critical for
coordinating energy homeostasis and reproduction in females. It is well known that E2 is anorexigenic, and that
Kiss1 neurons, which are directly regulated by E2, are essential for pubertal development and adult reproductive
success. However, their role in the control of other homeostatic functions is just emerging. Earlier, we found that
Kiss1ARH neurons are excited by leptin and insulin via canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) 5 channel
signaling and proposed that they may serve as an important hub in the control of energy homeostasis. Recently,
we found that high frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons releases glutamate to excite the
anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons but inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related
peptide (AgRP) neurons in both females and males. E2 increases vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2)
mRNA expression and glutamate release from female Kiss1ARH neurons to augment the POMC excitation and
AgRP inhibition. In contrast, Vglut2 mRNA expression and glutamate release are increased in castrates as
compared to intact males, illustrating an important sex difference in the synthesis and release of glutamate. Key
excitatory cationic channels are upregulated by E2 leading to increased excitability and glutamatergic synaptic
transmission. Recently, we have found that the selective membrane estrogen receptor (GqmER) agonist STX
increases the excitability of Kiss1ARH neurons without downregulating the peptide expression. It also decreases
food-intake in both females and males. Therefore, we hypothesize that estrogenic signaling in Kiss1ARH neurons
is important for increasing Kiss1ARH neuronal excitability and maintenance of homeostatic functions critical for
reproductive success. Our multidisciplinary approach incorporates a powerful set of cellular, molecular, genetic
and optogenetic tools, and our combined expertise in molecular biology, electrophysiology, and whole animal
physiology to address the following aims: (1) to measure the estrogenic-mediated increase in excitability of
Kiss1ARH neurons using GCaMP6 and Voltron recordings; (2) to elucidate the estrogenic modulation of the
synaptic input from Kiss1ARH to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons using optogenetic stimulation and
its effects on food intake in E2 (STX)-treated females and STX-treated males; and (3) to elucidate the estrogenic
modulation of synaptic input from Kiss1ARH neurons to hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus neurons and its effects
on energy expenditure in E2 (STX)-treated females and STX-treated males. Elucidating the circuits and signaling
cascades underlying the actions of E2 and STX will provide a neurophysiological/neuropharmacological
framework for a more thorough understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which Kiss1ARH neurons coordinate
homeostatic functions with reproduction."
10784607,"Advancements in neurotechnology are shaping the future of medical care for those suffering from neurological
illness, disease, and injury. Unfortunately, it can take decades to bring such advances from the benchtop to the
bedside in service of our Veterans. The development, evaluation, optimization, and deployment of each
subcomponent of a medical device is complex, and combinations of technologies are required to address the
complex needs of Veterans with, for example, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. In fact, the last major
neurotechnology translational success was arguably the deep brain stimulator (DBS) developed in the 1980’s,
delivering electrical neuromodulation to the brain to reduce Essential and Parkinson’s Disease-related tremor,
but were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration until 2002. While impressive technologies are on
the horizon, including those supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the time, money, and scientific
divide between benchtop successes and bedside therapeutic application is exceptionally vast. Bioelectronics
are hyped as an alternative to drug interventions, but the reality is that the translation timelines for medical
devices—and their success rates as therapeutic tools—mirror the slow and costly development of new
pharmaceuticals rather than mirroring the lean, accelerated development of new electronics for the consumer
market.
This issue matters because the socioeconomic burden of neurological injury and disorders is significant. Spinal
cord injuries (SCIs) alone are estimated to affect between 249,000 and 363,000 Americans (NSCISC), and
roughly 42,000 people with SCIs are Veterans, an estimated $5M/patient over their lifetime in health care
costs. Nearly half of all SCIs occur in people between the ages of 16 and 30, leaving many to live with the
injuries for decades. The inefficiency of bringing new drugs to market is dubbed “Eroom’s” law, given the
exponentially increasing cost of drug release—in contrast to Moore’s law, originally referring to the number of
transistors on a microchip doubling every 2 years though the cost of computers is halved, but more generally
illustrating the exponential growth for technologies over time. From a translational perspective, the efficiency of
medical device innovation still has much more in common with pharmacological research and development
(R&D) than it does with Moore’s law and consumer electronics.
We propose the development of a hardware and software accelerator platform (“cross-development”, or xDev)
for electrophysiology research and neurotechnology creation. Development of this platform would enable new
research into spinal cord stimulation for sensorimotor restoration in SCI, as well as for continued investigation
of spinal electrophysiology in closed-loop devices for chronic pain. The new tool will be used to accelerate
design, development and deployment of neurotechnology by smoothing the transition between design phases,
allowing rapid redesign and re-verification of neurotechnology components. The xDev platform maximizes the
ability of neurotechnology device developers to test their tools with versatile interfaces, algorithms, and
underlying chipsets, improving compatibility, cross-functionality, and inspiring new collaborations between
technology developers. Strategic platform organization protects neurotechnology developers’ intellectual
property, while improving modularity with tools from other manufacturers. Leveraging the xDev platform, we will
demonstrate a new neurotechnology enabling chronic recording of spinal electrophysiology and fill a
neuroscientific knowledge gap, connecting the fields of Restorative Neurology and therapeutic spinal cord
neuromodulation."
10873947,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Primary cilia are non-motile antenna-like sensors that protrude into extracellular space for detecting a wide
range of signals, including signals for cell proliferation control. Problems in primary cilium assembly and
structure/length maintenance, and failures to distribute ciliary sensory proteins to specific locations of the cilium,
are linked to a wide variety of medical disorders and developmental abnormalities (termed ciliopathies).
Assembly and maintenance of the ciliary framework (axoneme) and distribution of sensory proteins in the primary
cilium rely on motor-driven intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains that travel along axonemal microtubule complexes
(MtCs). Knowing details about IFT processes in the primary cilium is an essential foundation for understanding
the proper distribution of sensory proteins in the primary cilium. Understanding the functional roles of IFT
processes in primary cilium assembly and maintenance is fundamental for studies of related ciliopathies. The
objectives of this proposal are to determine how anterograde IFT trains move from the base along the axoneme
to reach the cilium tip, and then transition into the retrograde trains to move back in primary cilia, and how their
activities contribute to maintenance of the structure/length of the primary cilium axoneme. The long-term goal of
this proposal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the functional roles and associated physiological
processes of primary cilia in tissue homeostasis and ciliopathies. Our central hypothesis is that the behavior and
architecture of IFT trains in primary cilia differ from that in motile flagella. We will test our central hypothesis in three
specific aims: 1) Determine how IFT trains travel along the primary cilium axoneme by a correlative study using
both light microscopy (LM) and cellular electron microscopy (EM); 2) Determine how continuous IFT contributes
to primary cilium maintenance by serial section electron tomography (SSET) and three-dimensional (3D) image
analysis; and 3) Define the structural units and conformational changes of the IFT trains at the cilium tip by cryo-
electron tomography and 3D image analysis. We will pursue an innovative strategy that combines 3D cell
culturing methods and light microscopy with techniques of 3D-EM specimen preparation and data analysis to
overcome experimental difficulties for studying primary cilia of epithelial cells with inhibitable IFT. The proposed
research is significant because it will provide critical knowledge about the process of IFT trains moving along the
primary cilia, define the roles of IFT in primary-cilium structure maintenance, and offer the first structural-level
description of the molecular environment at the primary cilium tip that facilitates the IFT anterograde-retrograde
transition, cargo release, ectosome budding, and other important molecular events for physiological functions of
primary cilia. The impact of the proposed studies is broad, as the anticipated knowledge will become a previously
unavailable reference for studies of primary cilium functional mechanisms in development, organogenesis, tissue
homeostasis and wound repairing."
10838489,"Disparities in overweight and obesity (OWOB) prevalence between children (ages 5-11) from low- and middle-to-
high-income families persist. The structured days hypothesis posits that structure within a day, defined as a pre-
planned, segmented, and adult-supervised compulsory environment (like a school day), plays a protective role for
children against obesogenic behaviors and, ultimately, prevents the occurrence of negative health outcomes, such
as excessive weight gain. Essentially, the structured days hypothesis draws upon concepts in the ‘filled-time
perspective’ literature which posits that time filled with favorable activities cannot be filled with unfavorable activities.
There are at least two “windows of vulnerability” for children outside of the school day. These critically important
windows include the hours immediately following school (i.e., 3-6pm school days) and the 10 weeks of summer
vacation. Programs that can provide a healthy structured environment and prevent unhealthy weight gains exist
for both of these time periods (i.e., afterschool programs and summer day camps). Unfortunately, these
programs are too expensive for children from low-income families to attend. Thus, based on demand-side
financing, which has a long history addressing large scale public health problems in the United States through
federal, state, and local programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the 21st Century
Learning Centers Program, we will rigorously test the impact of providing access to pre-existing, community-
operated afterschool and summer programs on weight status (i.e., BMI z-score) and obesogenic behaviors (i.e.,
physical activity, screen use, diet, and sleep) of elementary children from low-income households. This approach
will potentially be less costly than current obesity treatment programs which cost up to $4,600 per child. This
study will employ a 2x2 full factorial design. The four groups will be a no-treatment control, afterschool program
voucher only, summer day camp voucher only, and vouchers for afterschool and summer day camp combined. We
will accomplish the following specific aims: AIM 1: Compare differences in primary and secondary outcomes
among children provided no voucher, a voucher for after-school only, a voucher for summer camp only, and a
voucher for both after-school and summer camp. AIM 2: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing a voucher
for after-school only, a voucher for summer camp only, and a voucher for both after-school and summer camp.
Aim 3: Evaluate facilitators and barriers to the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of the voucher
program by conducting qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (i.e., children, parents, staff, administrators).
This study is significant because nearly one in five children are obese, and disparities in OWOB exist between
children from low- and middle-to-high-income households persist despite past school-based interventions. This
study is innovative because it represents one of the first attempts to provide access to healthy structured
programming during two “windows of vulnerability” for children outside of the school day. Should the proposed
intervention strategy prove effective, it has the potential to mitigate disparities in OWOB prevalence."
10877768,"This Consortium for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD) will apply state-of-the-art technologies and
immunologic tools to focus on iterative, rational vaccine design that will lead to a successful final vaccine design.
Much work in previous years has led to this critical juncture in HIV-1 vaccine development where the route
forward has become clearer to a protective HIV-1 vaccine. The rationale for this grant is that the first 13 years
of the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology programs defined the roadblocks preventing a vaccine,
developed first generation HIV-1 immunogens to induce HIV-1 protective antibodies and established a
translational pipeline to accelerate HIV-1 vaccine development. The overall goal of this grant is to develop an
effective HIV-1 vaccine for global use. There are two foci proposed in the CHAVD: Focus 1, strategies for
induction of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), and Focus 2, strategies for induction of protective
HIV-1 non-neutralizing antibodies. In Focus 1, our overall goal is to design Env immunogens that will elicit
multiple specificities of bnAbs. Here the CHAVD team will design immunogens that induce bnAbs, induce
optimal CD4 T cell help for bnAb induction, transiently down-modulate constraints from negative regulatory
cells and immune tolerance mechanisms, and allow for disfavored bnAb B cell lineages to develop. In Focus
2, our overall goal is to develop multivalent immunogens that induce broad and potent protective non-
neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies (NNAbs). The Management and Operations Unit will oversee the CHAVD
translational pipeline, and each of our six Science Research Support Units (SRSUs) will provide key
elements of immunogen design or pre-clinical evaluation of candidate immunogens. Once designed and
tested in bnAb knock-in mice or in macaques, promising vaccine candidates that pass our go-no go criteria
will be vetted by the CHAVD Scientific Product Development Committee and DAIDS, then produced for
clinical trials in our GMP Production Unit at Duke and tested in Phase I trials by the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network. Our Clinical Trials Sample Analysis Unit will determine the immunogenicity achieved and
provide feedback on immune responses induced in man to Focus 1 or Focus 2 and our SRSUs for iterative
improvement of immunogens. We expect that by the end of this grant, a final vaccine candidate will be
delivered to the NIAID that has reproducibly induced durable levels of either bnAbs or protective NNAbs in rhesus
macaques (RMs) or in a Phase I trial in humans, or in both."
10879163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is
an evolutionarily unprecedented natural experiment that causes major changes to the host immune system.
Several high risk COVID-19 populations have been identified. Older adults, males, persons of color, and those
with certain underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.) are at higher risk for severe
disease from COVID-19. While it is too soon to fully understand the impact of COVID-19 on overall health and
well-being, there are already several reports of significant sequelae, which appear to correlate with disease
severity. There is a clear and urgent need to develop prediction tests for adverse short- and long-term outcomes,
especially for high-risk COVID-19 populations. We hypothesize that complementary multi-dimensional
information gathered near the time of symptom onset can be used to predict new onset or worsening
frailty, organ dysfunction and death within one year after COVID-19 onset. A single parameter provides
limited information and is incapable of adequately characterizing the complex biological responses in
symptomatic COVID-19 to predict outcome. Since they were designed for other illnesses, it is unlikely that
existing clinical tools, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and other organ function assessment scores, will
precisely assess the long-term prognosis of this novel disease. Our extensive experience in biomarker
development suggests that integrating molecular and clinical data increases prediction accuracy of long-term
outcomes. We have chosen to test our hypothesis in a population reflecting US-demographics that is at
increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. We will enroll patients, broadly reflecting US
demographics, from a hospitalized civilian population in one of the country’s largest metropolitan areas and a
representative National Veteran’s population. We anticipate that a prediction test that performs well in this
hospitalized patient group will: help guide triaging and treatment decisions and, therefore, reduce morbidity and
mortality rates, enhance patient quality of life, and improve healthcare cost-effectiveness. More accurate
prognostic information will also assist clinicians in framing goals of care discussions in situations of likely futility
and assist patients and families in this decision-making process. Finally, it will provide a logical means for
allocating resources in short supply, such as ventilators or therapeutics with limited availability."
10805450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major health problem, afflicting 1.2 million hospitalized patients annually in the US.
Maladaptive renal repair after AKI promotes development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), leaving affected
patients at high risk for dialysis dependency, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Studies show that males are
disproportionately and more severely affected by AKI than females, including COVID-19-associated AKI.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain poorly understood. Moreover,
there are no targeted therapies that interrupt this devastating disease process in both sexes. Using single-cell
transcriptomics and mouse genetics, our ongoing studies found that the female sex confers marked protection
against ferroptosis, a distinct, non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death and a critical driver of maladaptive repair
after AKI in mice and humans. Ferroptosis is triggered by the inability of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to
remove toxic lipid peroxides from cell membranes, leading to the accelerated accumulation of toxic lipid
peroxides (ferroptotic stress) and cell rupture. Acute ischemic and toxic kidney injuries reduce GPX4 in proximal
tubular (PT) cells, thus making these cells vulnerable to ferroptosis. Severe AKI also induces pathologic
transcriptional alteration of PT cells into an inflammatory phenotype and prevents their recovery to a healthy
state (impaired plasticity). Our data show that in males but not in females, genetic deletion of Gpx4 promotes
the accumulation of inflammatory PT cells and triggers their death by ferroptosis. To advance these clinically
impactful lines of investigation, we will test our overarching hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in resilience to
ferroptosis underlies sex differences in clinical outcomes after AKI. We further hypothesize that uncovering the
mechanisms of how sex hormones regulate ferroptosis sensitivity will enable identification of targetable
downstream pathways that improve AKI outcomes for both sexes. Directly testing these hypotheses, we will
integrate unbiased single-cell transcriptomics, genetic mouse models, pharmacological studies, and human
kidney organoids with two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine sex-dependent mechanisms by which
ferroptosis promotes maladaptive repair at single-cell resolution using our tubule-specific, doxycycline-inducible
Gpx4 knockout mouse model. We will also investigate the therapeutic effects of ferroptosis inhibitors to enhance
renal repair in our murine kidney injury models in vivo and in human in vitro AKI models using organoids. In Aim
2, we will test our hypothesis that sex hormones regulate the sensitivity to ferroptosis and PT cell plasticity after
AKI using gonadectomy and genetic inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling. The results of these studies will
provide compelling preclinical mechanistic evidence for how ferroptotic stress governs PT cell fate. Our studies
will identify new therapeutic targets to enhance renal ferroptotic stress resilience and promote healthy PT
recovery from injury, thereby interrupting the AKI to CKD transition in both sexes."

This is a proof of concept pilot study, a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of
low dose metformin on improving pain and other symptoms in patients with the fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).
FMS is a common chronic pain disorder with no cure. Current treatments are only partially effective in about
50% of patients. There is therefore a critical need to identify effective therapies to lessen the suffering
experienced by patients with FMS. Metformin is an intriguing candidate, as preclinical studies indicate that it
treats hyperalgesia and can also reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Metformin
causes the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which acts as a master switch kinase
modulating several key enzymes and transcription factors. The objective of this study is to determine the
effectiveness of metformin in treating symptoms of FMS. Our preliminary evidence in a rat model of FMS
demonstrates that metformin dramatically reduces hyperalgesia. We also show that important enzymes
downstream of AMPK, namely the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and the nod-like
receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, also result in antinociception when they are antagonized. This data
provides a possible mechanism for metformin’s pain-relieving effects. We hypothesize that reduced AMPK
activation contributes to the hyperalgesia, cognitive and mood disturbances experienced by FMS patients, and
metformin will restore AMPK activity and ameliorate these disabling symptoms. Our objective will be
accomplished in two aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the effect of low dose metformin on symptom severity in FMS
patients via a randomized, double-blinded RCT with 2 parallel dosing arms comparing the effects of placebo
and 500mg of once a day metformin on improving pain and other symptoms in 72 patients with FMS. Aim 2 will
determine the pathways downstream of AMPK that contribute to decreased symptom severity in FMS patients.
Blood will be collected, processed, and analyzed using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to
determine leukocyte mRNA gene expression of AMPK, mTORC1 and NLRP3 as well as using standard lab
metabolic tests to test for signs of insulin resistance. This data will provide preliminary information regarding
the mechanism of metformin induced anti-nociception that can be pursued in more detail in a future R01/U01
study. We expect that our studies will determine the effectiveness of metformin on pain and comorbid FMS
symptoms and delineate the role that AMPK and its downstream targets play on these phenotypes. We expect
that these results will demonstrate the efficacy of an intervention not currently used clinically to treat FMS.
Understanding these pathways represents a critical step in the development of non-addictive pain treatments
and holds enormous potential to reduce disability in the 10 million Americans with FMS."

The molecular mechanisms and the clinical predictors of life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with dilated,
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain elusive, hampering adequate prevention and treatment of sudden
cardiac death (SCD) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) in this population. Our application will address
this unmet need. Our established team of investigators from the University of Colorado and Stanford University
has assembled preliminary data and proof-of-concept experiments to tackle three complementary aims, which
will comprehensively fill critical knowledge gaps in life-threatening VA and SCD risk in DCM. We hypothesize
that two main mechanisms are involved in VA/SCD in DCM: genetic factors (“arrhythmogenic” genes) and
cardiac fibrosis. We will address these hypotheses with three independent but complementary Specific Aims
(clinical, translational and mechanistic) designed to translate the discovery of mechanisms and delineation of
prognosis into a precision medicine approach. Specific Aim 1 will define genotype and phenotype
predictors of malignant VA and SCD in DCM. Our preliminary studies show that phenotype, such as
myocardial fibrosis, and gene mutations significantly increase the risk of VA/SCD. Thus, we hypothesize that a
clinical multidisciplinary approach including genotype and advanced imaging can precisely identify DCM patients
at risk of SCD. Using deep phenotyping, outcome measures, and NextGen sequencing in the Familial
Cardiomyopathy Registry (1,316 DCM subjects), we will generate a SCD risk prediction score for clinical use.
Specific Aim 2 will identify the transcriptome signature of VA. We found that explanted hearts of patients
with arrhythmogenic DCM have a distinct transcriptional signature. Thus, we hypothesize that, in advanced-
stage DCM, lethal arrhythmias are driven by genetically determined transcriptional signatures. We will leverage
whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data from our NIH/NHLBI TOPMed project (X01 HL139403: 1078
explanted hearts, 504 DCM, 140 controls) to identify gene-specific dysregulated pathways predicting high-risk
VA. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of arrhythmogenic genes. Our preliminary
data in mutant human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) show evidence of
intrinsic electrical instability. However, the role of cardiac fibroblasts and CM/CF cross-talk in arrhythmogenesis
remains unknown. We hypothesize that arrhythmogenic DCM genes activate fibroblasts and induce arrhythmia,
either directly or indirectly through their interaction with cardiomyocytes. hiPSC-CM and cardiac fibroblasts
(hiPSC-CF) will be generated from 60 patients from our Registry (Aim 1) and genome edited models with
mutations in arrhythmogenic genes (LMNA, FLNC, DSP), and 20 age/gender/ethnicity-matched healthy
individuals. Using engineered heart tissue scaffolds (EHT), we will elucidate the mechanisms of CFs activation
and arrhythmia, compare altered signaling pathways in iPSC-derived models with those in the explanted hearts
cohort (Aim 2), and pharmacologically rescue the phenotype."
10783079,"UNDERSTANDING A MOLECULAR CASCADE THAT DRIVES NEUTROPHIL MEDIATED PATHOLOGY IN ARTHRITIS
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a frequent chronic disease of the synovial joints characterized by painful loss
of mobility due to unrestrained inflammation and progressive bone erosion. Disease etiology is poorly
characterized, and the available therapeutic approaches fail to control disease symptoms in many RA patients,
highlighting the critical need for identification of new therapeutic targets. A key event in RA is the influx of
leukocytes, such as neutrophils, into the joints, where they initiate and sustain inflammation and contribute to
bone erosion from the early stages of RA. While healthy synovial fluid is acellular, the most abundant cell type
found in the inflamed synovial fluid is the activated neutrophil.
 Engulfment and cell motility protein-1 (ELMO1) is a regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics during
phagocytosis of dying cells and migration of lymphocytes. We demonstrated that Elmo1–/– mice develop
significantly milder disease in two models of inflammatory arthritis that share many features with human RA, and
that deletion of Elmo1 during established disease could improve arthritis symptoms and disease resolution. We
found that disease resistance is due to specific ELMO1 function in neutrophils, and that loss of ELMO1
significantly attenuated neutrophil activation and migration (induced by chemokines involved in arthritis) and
reduced neutrophil mobilization to the joints. Circulating Elmo1–/– neutrophils had reduced cell surface levels of
the tethering molecule CD62L, and reduced chemokine-induced exposure of the adhesion/migration-promoting
integrin CD11b. These data suggest that ELMO1 function may be required for multiple steps of the neutrophil
recruitment cascade to enhance neutrophil recruitment into joints. Surprisingly, loss of ELMO1 did not impair
neutrophil recruitment and function elicited by bacterial stimuli, indicating that therapeutic targeting of ELMO1
could maintain normal pathogen clearance. Finally, the RA-associated SNP rs11984075, located in an intron of
the ELMO1 gene, correlates with increased ELMO1 protein and elevated CD62L in neutrophils, suggesting that
RA patients with SNP rs11984075 could benefit from therapeutic approaches targeting ELMO1. We hypothesize
that ELMO1 contributes to tissue/stimulus-specific neutrophil recruitment and pathology in inflammatory arthritis.
 In this proposal, we will address three specific aims: 1. Test if ELMO1 is required for stimulus- or tissue-
specific neutrophil recruitment. 2. Test if ELMO1 promotes neutrophil adhesion through CD62L/L-selectin, and
3. Identify the mechanism by which ELMO1 SNP rs11984075 elevates protein levels and test an inhibitor of
ELMO1 in arthritis. This proposal is significant because it will further our understanding of the role of ELMO1 in
neutrophil-mediated pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and could lead to the discovery of new diagnostic tools and
therapeutic strategies. Our proposal is innovative because it will advance new concepts in ELMO1 biology and
will generate new tools for the scientific community and for studying neutrophil functions."
10828868,"Dynorphin, a novel paracrine factor that regulates insulin secretion
 The inability to maintain glucose homeostasis leads to diabetes, a life-threatening disease of epidemic
proportions. The adaptation of pancreatic islets to insulin resistance is a significant determinant of developing
type 2 diabetes (T2D). Within the pancreatic islet, the crosstalk between different islet cells through paracrine
signals orchestrates a hormonal response that controls glucose levels. Dysregulation of these signals contributes
to impaired glucose homeostasis and diabetes.
 The long-term goal of my research program is to understand how paracrine interactions within islet cells
regulate hormone secretion and glucose homeostasis in physiological and pathological conditions. The objective
of this proposal is to assess the β- to δ-cell Dynorphin (Dyn)/Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) negative feedback
loop during physiology and pathological states. The central hypothesis is that insulin secretion is regulated by a
novel β- to δ-cell Dyn/KOR negative feedback loop, and this feedback loop regulates glucose homeostasis and
contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes. The rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify
key targets for improving insulin secretion in conditions of insulin resistance and diabetes. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims:
 1) Characterize the Dyn secretion in mouse and human β-cells and determine the contribution to islet function
and glucose homeostasis (First component of the feedback loop).
 2) Determine the role of δ-cell KOR and examine the potential of the Dyn/KOR axis as a therapeutic target in
diabetes (Second component of the feedback loop).
 We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of newly generated mice models with specific
deletion of KOR in δ-cells and overexpression and deletion of Dyn in β-cells.
 The proposed research is significant because it will identify that the endogenous opioid peptide Dyn, is a key
intra-islet paracrine molecule that regulates insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. It is also significant
because it will reveal how the regulation of KOR impacts islet secretion in diabetogenic conditions. This work will
develop foundational knowledge of how Dyn and its function in islet cells impact glucose metabolism and insulin
resistance. The proximate expected outcome of this work is understanding the mechanism of how the Dyn/KOR
axis participates in the adaptation of β-cells to insulin resistance and β-cell injury.
The results will have an important positive impact immediately. After all, we will uncover the role of the
Dyn/KOR axis in islet function. Resolving the in vivo mechanisms of β- to δ-cell Dyn/KOR negative feedback
loop will have profound implications for glucose homeostasis and serve to develop potential targets for T2D."
10767990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Development and reproduction of insects, including human disease vectors such as mosquitoes, are
mainly controlled by two lipophilic hormones: ecdysone and juvenile hormone (JH). Although these hormones
need to enter their target cells to exert their biological effects, almost nothing is known regarding molecular
mechanisms that regulate hormone transport across cellular membranes. This is due to the prevailing dogma
in endocrinology that lipophilic hormones enter and exit cells by simple diffusion across lipid bilayers. However,
despite this dominant assumption, the simple diffusion model of lipophilic hormone transport is not supported
by any conclusive evidence in any organism. Indeed, recent studies now suggest that some lipophilic
hormones, including the insect steroid hormone ecdysone, require membrane transporter proteins to travel
across plasma membranes. The overall objective of this project is to identify and characterize membrane
transporters required for JH trafficking across cellular membranes, and to thereby challenge the conventional
paradigm that lipophilic hormones freely enter and exit cells by simple diffusion. The approach will combine in
vitro and in vivo approaches to characterize JH Transporter (JHT), which was discovered in preliminary studies
using the fruit fly model system. In Aim 1, functions of the JHT ortholog in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes
aegypti, the primary vector for Zika, yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue viruses, will be thoroughly
investigated in vitro using an arsenal of molecular genetic tools. In Aim 2, JHT functions will be further studied
genetically in Aedes. As JH controls both growth and reproduction in Aedes and other mosquitoes,
characterization of Aedes JHT is expected to aid our effort to combat these deadliest disease vectors for
humans. Indeed, in Aim 3, in vitro chemical screening will be conducted to identify compounds that can inhibit
functions of Aedes JHT, and their effects will be tested in vivo. The significance of this project is therefore not
just to overturn the long-standing dogma in endocrinology, but also to provide a critical proof of concept as well
as seed compounds for developing novel pharmacological tools to control mosquitoes and other deadly
disease vector insects."

Lethal lung developmental disorders (LLDDs) are rarely diagnosed but devastating pulmonary hypoplasias
(PHs), presenting with progressive neonatal hypoxia and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Based
on histopathological appearance, LLDDs have been traditionally classified as alveolar capillary dysplasia with
misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), acinar dysplasia (AcDys), congenital alveolar dysplasia (CAD),
and other unspecified primary PHs. We found that heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the
mesenchymal transcription factor (TF) FOXF1 gene or copy-number variant (CNV) deletions involving FOXF1
or its lung-specific enhancer located ~ 300 kb upstream are responsible for ACDMPV in 80-90% of patients. We
reported that this enhancer also up-regulates in cis lncRNA FENDRR mapping nearby FOXF1. Interestingly,
unlike SNVs, CNV deletions arise almost exclusively on the maternal chromosome 16. Recently, we and others
demonstrated the causative role for variants in another mesenchymal TF, TBX4, and a paracrine signaling
molecule FGF10 in greater than 60% of infants with AcDys, CAD, and other primary PHs, indicating the
significance also of TBX4-FGF10 signaling in pathogenesis of LLDDs. Importantly, FOXF1 and TBX4 variants
have been associated also with more common idiopathic or familial childhood PAH. Interestingly, we found a
statistically significant enrichment of non-coding SNVs in the FOXF1 and TBX4 enhancers in patients with
variable presentation of LLDD. Moreover, our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies have implied interactions between
the SHH-FOXF1 and TBX4-FGF10 signaling pathways, involving little-known lung-specific endothelial
transmembrane protein TMEM100. We hypothesize that (i) non-coding SNVs within the regulatory regions of
lung developmental genes can dramatically modify (alleviate or exacerbate) LLDD and PAH phenotypes, (ii) an
interplay between the coding and non-coding variants can explain the complex compound inheritance observed
in families with LLDDs and PAH, and (iii) interaction of SHH-FOXF1 and TBX4-FGF10 signaling pathways,
involving TMEM100, is required for proper human lung development. Using human lung specimens and cell lines
and mouse models, we will identify and analyze non-coding regulatory elements of FOXF1 in patients with
ACDMPV and/or PAH (Aim 1) and those of TBX4 and FGF10 in patients with AcDys, CAD, other PHs, and/or
PAH (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will decipher the crosstalk between SHH-FOXF1 and TBX4-FGF10 epithelial-
mesenchymal signaling, involving TMEM100, to untangle the complex compound inheritance in families with
LLDDs and PAH. Our studies will elucidate the genetics of lung development in humans and how its perturbations
translate to phenotypic variability of LLDDs and PAH. We will identify new genetic variants, allowing for more
precise diagnosis and prognosis of these disorders, facilitating more informative genetic counseling, and
providing targets for development of potential in utero treatments for LLDDs and PAH. Our data will also help to
better understand incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity phenomena in human genetics in general."
10825572,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal will be to develop a diverse set of new chemical tools centered
on tetrazine ligation– the fastest known bioorthogonal reaction. This proposal describes
a continued effort to develop new bioorthogonal reagents. Methods will be developed for
the safe synthesis and direct coupling of ‘minimalist’ tetrazines to any molecule of
interest, including chemical probes and fluorescent reporters. We also propose to
develop tetrazines that can serve as “affinity bioorthogonal chemistry” tags that can
serve a dual role in enabling protein purification followed by subsequent site-selective
bioorthogonal chemistry. Applications to on-resin protein-protein and protein-biomolecule
assembly are proposed. We propose to develop efficient catalytic methods for ‘turning
on’ rapid bioorthogonal chemistry in cellular context, providing tool molecules with high
stability in the cellular environment in their ‘off’ state, and the fastest bioorthogonal
reactions to date in their ‘on’ state. Efficient photocatalysts have been developed that
can target bioorthogonal turn-on in vivo and at the subcellular level. Near-IR
photocatalysts as well as thermal catalysts will be developed as will new enabling
technologies for studying protein dynamics and for proteomic target identification.
Finally, we will also develop bioorthogonal N-acylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-
acylglucosamine (NAG) molecules for use in probe applications in microbiology and
immunology research."
10896301,"Project Summary:
This proposal develops a novel, continually adaptive learning, and web-based tool which automatically and
continually integrates and curates biomedical literature and knowledge. It allows researchers and curators to
continually integrate individual lab-generated articles with large-scale public repositories, thereby enabling
biomedical users to perform custom and context-based integrative literature analysis and exploration. More
specifically, the proposed framework proposes a novel knowledge-enriched representation learning model that
continually interleaves the available biomedical corpora with the biomedical knowledge from domain-expert
curated knowledge bases to generate a knowledge-enriched representation needed by curators to annotate
biomedical journal articles, preprints, and clinical records with high accuracy and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, the proposed framework builds an evolving multi-dimensional knowledge network that incorporates
fresh knowledge into the knowledge network via dynamic updates. Such an up-to-date knowledge network
facilitates perpetual exploration of biomedical literature and allows researchers and curators to fulfill their
personalized information navigation needs quickly. Finally, the proposed web-based tool enables users to flexibly
integrate their own/personalized articles and lab reports into the massive existing corpora and knowledge bases,
query the up-to-date biomedical information landscapes, and drill down into aspects relevant to them in order to
fulfill their specific analysis goals. Currently, there is no automatic or systematic method to continually integrate
individual lab-generated articles with large-scale public repositories that enables biomedical researchers and
curators to perform integrative analysis based on their own context and obtain biologically meaningful results.
Thus, the proposed research is an important step to expedite the goal of automatically and continually curating
entities from large-scale biomedical corpora, integrating valuable information from the community curated
platforms, and designing an advanced navigation system that allows users to perform knowledge exploration for
their specific information needs. Dissemination activities through tools will help promote the adoption of the
proposed system into real-world laboratories and research environments, and beyond. Moreover, such a form
of integration promotes great outreach and demonstrates our commitment to the FAIR principles, the ability to
Find, Access, Interoperate, and Reuse digital content."
10913431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol-related traffic fatality and injury continue to be a major public health problem in the United States.
Driving under the influence (DUI) remains one of the most frequently repeated offenses, with over one-third of
offenders being charged with a second DUI offense within five years. Prevention programs involve motivational
interviewing and education with emphasis on increasing the offender’s perceptions of the risks associated with
alcohol use (i.e., increasing “risk awareness”). Our laboratory research has examined acute responses to
alcohol in DUI offenders and showed they display heightened impulsivity and reduced perceptions of
impairment. This suggests a lack of risk awareness in the intoxicated state, when critical decisions are made
about whether or not to drive. This 4-year R01 proposal builds on this evidence by testing the efficacy of
feedback-based training to increase DUI offenders’ perceptions of risk associated with alcohol use. DUI
offenders will undergo experiential feedback-based training in which they are administered controlled doses of
alcohol and receive structured feedback and training to accurately appraise the behavioral impairing effects of
the dose and accurately estimate their breath alcohol concentration. The research tests the hypothesis that this
training will increase risk awareness among DUI offenders during intoxication as evident by reduced
disinhibiting and risk-taking effects in response to alcohol. Our evidence for atypical reactions to alcohol among
DUI offenders truly breaks new ground and identifies promising treatment targets for new interventions to
reduce recidivism. Testing the efficacy of this experiential-based feedback approach represents a logical next
step that advances the field by building upon the basic science to date."
10916217,"The lifetime cumulative incidence of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or UF) is >80% among Black women and
~70% in White women. UF are the most common reason for hysterectomy in the U.S. and can cause heavy
menstrual bleeding requiring blood transfusion(s), pelvic pain, urinary and bowel problems, infertility, and
substantial impairment of quality of life (QOL). While alternatives to hysterectomy are available including
myomectomy (fibroid removal), uterine artery embolization (UAE), endometrial ablation (EA), and
radiofrequency ablation (RFA), there are significant knowledge gaps that preclude the development of
evidence-based clinical guidelines to select an appropriate UF treatment. Prior studies of UF treatments have
several key deficits including limited follow-up time (<2 years) and failure to assess important confounders,
such as pre-procedure fibroid characteristics, baseline QOL, and pregnancy intention. Two multisite registries
with harmonized data, COMPARE-UF (Myomectomy, EA and UAE patients) and ULTRA (RFA patients), have
the capacity to address critical evidence gaps and significantly improve care for women with UF.
 This project will be led by COMPARE-UF/ULTRA investigators (MPIs) and extend the follow-up of 700
COMPARE-UF and ULTRA participants who have had a uterine-sparing fibroid treatment for up to 10 years
after the index procedure. Long term follow-up through menopause is critical to assess the durability of
symptom improvement and the rates of hysterectomy or other uterine procedures following the index
treatment. Currently, women in COMPARE-UF/ULTRA are followed only for 1-3 years post treatment; the
additional follow-up in this proposal, will have a major impact on clinical decision-making, provide relevant data
in a racially diverse (>40% Black) population, and include detailed imaging information (UF size, number and
location), and self-reported desire for future fertility obtained prior to the index fibroid treatment. Among women
who have undergone one of four uterine-sparing procedures (myomectomy, EA, UAE and RFA), validated
questionnaires from pre-procedure will be repeated annually up to 10 years post-procedure, to achieve the
following: Aim 1: Compare changes in fibroid symptoms and quality of life from pre-procedure up to 10 years
post-procedure among four uterine-sparing procedures: myomectomy, EA, UAE, and RFA. Aim 2: Compare
the rate of and time until treatment failure up to 10 years after the index treatment among participants who had
myomectomy, EA, UAE, and RFA. Aim 3: Identify baseline factors that predict clinical effectiveness after
myomectomy, EA, UAE, and RFA and with patient and provider input, create a clinical prediction tool (Fibroid
Treatment Calculator) that supports informed decision-making. Our preliminary data demonstrate ongoing
active engagement of these participants. This project is a time-limited opportunity that uses two well-designed
longitudinal cohorts with comprehensive baseline information collected with validated questionnaires and will
yield results for immediate application in clinical care."

Abstract
Spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES), which creates an electrical field directly over the spinal cord, has shown early promise for the restoration of voluntary and reflex control of the lower urinary tract (LUT) among individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). A major advantage of the proposed multi-electrode array over the Interstim system and transcutaneous approach is the versatility of the multi-electrode and the ability to activate multiple structures and functions simultaneously with a single electrode placement and device. The goal of this pre-clinical research is to optimize scES for functional benefits and identify mechanism(s) to better facilitate daily management and improve quality of life. It is hypothesized that effective scES for both bladder storage and emptying occurs when initiated chronically post-SCI through activation of spinal bladder circuits including neurons within the dorsal commissure, superficial dorsal horn, sacral parasympathetic nucleus, and Onuf’s nucleus, with the requirement of intact hypogastric/pelvic/pudendal nerves, and with greater effectiveness when given in combination with locomotor training. For Aim 1, previously identified optimal parameters will be used to identify neural components of the spinal networks contributing to scES-induced LUT effects with different chronicity’s post-SCI in urethane-anesthetized rats using two approaches: a) Fos protein induction (a marker for postsynaptic activation of spinal neurons), and b) select peripheral nerve transections. Examining the contributing spinal central regions activated with scES and key peripheral components for different aspects of LUT function will provide novel targets for further development and refinement of epidural arrays and controllers. For Aim 2, the impact of scES on LUT functions in SCI rats after treatment with differing periodicities of locomotor training will be examined to address the potential added benefit of a combinatory approach (neuromodulation with rehabilitation). A sub-aim examines the underlying Fos induced central neural components, as plasticity is likely induced with training. Both aims will also include bladder histology/molecular biology assessments re the effects of chronicity/training. These studies will significantly move the SCI field forward by providing optimal parameters and locations for targeting LUT function that will be key for advancing the existing technology."
10851760,"ABSTRACT
Bacterial keratitis (corneal infection) is a vision threatening disease and contributes significantly to world
blindness. The important human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, is a predominant cause of keratitis, causing
aggressive infections that often lead to irreparable ocular tissue damage. While much attention has been given
to understanding the pathogenesis of S. aureus in non-ocular sites of infection such as sepsis, endocarditis or
osteomyelitis, surprisingly, relatively little is yet known about the bacterial virulence factors that govern S. aureus
keratitis. In the absence of this knowledge, it is impossible to understand the fundamental pathogenesis of S.
aureus keratitis or rationally design therapeutics to treat this blinding disease. Accordingly, the central goal
of this proposal is to identify and characterize S. aureus genetic determinants that modulate keratitis.
Given the unique environment of the ocular surface and cornea with respect to tear film composition, sheer
forces generated from blinking, and relative immune privilege, we hypothesize that there will be a unique set of
virulence factors that drive keratitis. Our laboratory has developed innovative tools that will allow, for the first
time, the ability to prospectively identify and validate the comprehensive set of S. aureus virulence factors that
play a role in BK pathogenesis. Our discovery pipeline leverages state of the art genomics and bioinformatics
including whole genome sequencing, Tn-seq and RNA-seq to generate high priority leads for mechanism of
action studies, as well as the evaluation of biologic significance in our murine model of keratitis. We have
successfully used this approach to identify and validate enterotoxins, secreted bacterial proteins well known for
their cytotoxicity and ability to modulate the host immune response, as important in mediating keratitis. Thus,
this proposal will build on this exciting preliminary data to develop an expanded list of the key drivers of keratitis.
Ultimately this work will directly advance our understanding of S. aureus keratitis pathogenesis and as such,
may be foundational in supporting strategies for the therapeutic intervention of this debilitating disease."
10896413,"Plasma membrane dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) is expressed exclusively in dopaminergic neurons and
serves for the reuptake of extracellular DA into these neurons to limit the duration and amplitude of DA signaling
in the brain. DAT is a primary target of addictive psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines. DAT
expression levels at the plasma membrane of synaptic areas of striatal DA axons is the major determinant of
extracellular DA concentrations, and these levels are defined by membrane trafficking. However, mechanisms
by which proper distribution of DAT within the neuron and its membrane compartments is controlled by trafficking,
how intracellular signaling regulates this trafficking and how abused psychostimulants affect DAT traffic in vivo
remain poorly understood.
 The fundamental goal of our research is to define how intracellular trafficking regulates DAT function.
During the last cycle of this program, we described the kinetics and mechanisms of the “long-distance” DAT
traffic between midbrain and striatum through the medial forebrain bundle axons using HA-epitope tagged DAT
(HA-DAT) knock-in mice that we have previously generated. Analysis of HA-DAT trafficking in intact mouse brain
was enabled by the development of a novel HA-DAT endocytosis assay using stereotactic injections of HA
antibodies. We have also discovered dramatic down-regulation of DAT in the striatum of amphetamine-sensitized
male but not female mice, with the strongest amphetamine effects observed in nucleus accumbens. We identified
small-molecule compounds that stabilize DAT oligomers and cause robust DAT endocytosis with remarkable
specificity to DAT, which led to the demonstration of the coupling of DAT molecular mechanics and substrate-
transport activity with its oligomerization and endocytosis. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that an
inward-facing (IF) conformation of DAT induced by amphetamine favors DAT endocytosis. Generation of new
DAT mutants led to hypothesis that a PDZ domain protein mediates protein kinase C dependent ubiquitination
and endocytosis of DAT. Development of the DAT fusion protein with ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) and
demonstration of the feasibility of tracking the temporally resolved proximity proteome of APEX2-DAT opened
new avenues for defining DAT interactome in specific brain regions and in animals treated with amphetamine,
which will be indispensable for studying mechanisms involved in DAT regulation in vivo. We will pursue our
comprehensive analysis of DAT trafficking and function by: 1) defining the molecular mechanisms of drug- and
stimuli-induced endocytosis of DAT using heterologous cells and DA neurons; 2) elucidating the mechanisms
underlying down-regulation of DAT in response to amphetamine challenge of amphetamine-sensitized mice and
sex-dependence of this response; 3) defining the brain-region-specific proximity proteome of DAT in mouse brain
using APEX2-based biotin labeling combined with quantitative mass-spectrometry and analyzing putative DAT
interactors and regulators."
10846694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an increasing focus on understanding the role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders including
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), a disease defined by the accumulation of amyloid beta rich plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles containing tau. Microglia are proposed to play a variety of critical roles during disease
progression including synaptic engulfment, cytokine release, and phagocytosis of amyloid beta (Aβ). Further,
recent GWAS studies have implicated innate immune processes in LOAD, supporting the importance of
understanding the neuroimmunological processes underlying the risk and progression of AD. All recent large-
scale GWAS have identified SNPs at the INPP5D locus that are significantly associated with AD. INPP5D
expression is largely restricted to microglial cells in the human adult brain and we have confirmed previous
findings that RNA levels of INPP5D are elevated in AD brain. However, through quantitative western blotting, we
show that protein levels of full length, water-soluble INPP5D are reduced in AD brain. To study the functional
consequences of reduced INPP5D, we used both pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9 genome
engineering to lower INPP5D activity in human iPSC-derived microglia. Through unbiased RNA and proteomic
profiling and a series of pharmacological manipulations, we demonstrated that reduction of INPP5D activity
induces changes in immune signaling and, more specifically, the activation of the inflammasome. These studies
have raised important questions that we aim to address in this proposal regarding the constitution of INPP5D in
microglia in the Alzheimer’s brain (aim 1), the molecular mechanism(s) linking INPP5D and inflammasome
activation (aim 2), and the functional consequences of loss of INPP5D activity and inflammasome activation in
microglia on astrocytes and neurons (aim 3). In aim 1, we will utilize quantitative immunostaining, sequential
extraction and western blotting, and ELISA to deeply interrogate INPP5D levels and markers of inflammasome
activation across a large cohort of human brain samples and iPSC-derived microglia cultures. Aim 2 interrogates
candidate pathways that may link INPP5D activity with inflammasome activation that arose from our preliminary
analyses. The first of these involves upregulation of PLA2G7, second through dysregulation of scavenger
receptors and the third through disruption of lysosome function. Finally, in aim 3 we utilize co-culture models of
iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia and a conditional INPP5D knock out mouse model to determine
the consequences of reduction of INPP5D levels in microglia on neuron and astrocyte biology in the context of
AD relevant environments. Together, these studies will provide important new insights into our understanding of
the fundamental role of INPP5D in microglia in health and disease, regulation of inflammasome activation in
human microglia, and the consequences of sub-lytic inflammasome activation in microglia on neuron and
astrocyte biology."
10849908,"This U19 Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Center (AACDRC) Program brings together a
team of investigators in three interactive projects and two cores to focus on the pathobiology of specific innate
immune mechanisms in viral infection and asthma. In the renewal of our AADCRC program, we will continue
to focus on the critical and often understudied innate immune factors surfactant protein-A (SP-A), the
anion lipids of surfactant, (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI))
and Toll interacting protein (Tollip), an innate immune mediator known to cross talk with SP-A and the
anionic lipids. Each of these mediators works synergistically to modulate inflammatory and immunologic
responses in asthma and infection given their complementary functions. Our exciting preliminary data underpin
our program’s overall hypothesis that POPG/PI, Tollip and SP-A function as unique immune modulators
that attenuate the impact of specific viral infections (RV-C, Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2) in type-2
asthma. The investigators in this program have a long history of collaboration at the. University of Arizona and
National Jewish Health; Cedar Sinai Medical Center is now included in this renewal. The Administrative Core
(Core A) of this Program will perform an important role to maintain productive and vibrant collaboration, ensure
and track adherence to NIH and other relevant regulations and guidelines, and manage activities that will
continue to strengthen the research community surrounding this Program. The Administrative Core has the
following Specific Aims: (1) Manage the day-to-day administrative details and programmatic needs of the
AADCRC program by providing fiscal management, administering subcontracts, assuring that regulatory
requirements in are met, and monitoring of progress with program objectives; (2) Create an infrastructure to
facilitate communication between the projects, cores and. investigators, and NIH Program Directors and to
provide conflict resolution should it be necessary; (3) Assist with dissemination of research findings in a timely
fashion to the scientific community, both locally and nationally, and provide information to the public, including
study participants; 4) Implement the Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund for the AADCRC. Our proposal builds
upon our active and productive collaborations of over 20 years and will significantly enhance our understanding
of the innate molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between type 2 inflammation in and viral
exacerbations of asthma. The strong synergy among our projects will accelerate progress toward novel
therapies by demonstrating that the innate immune components under study protect against viral
infection in asthma."

employ use of biologic airway and peripheral systemic specimen samples obtained from well-phenotyped
participants with and without type 2 asthma and atopy through Core B, the Clinical Core. We hypothesize that
POPG/PI, Tollip and SP-A function as unique immune modulators which attenuate the effects of viral
infections in type 2 asthma, specifically RV-C, influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. Supplementation of
functional POPG/PI, SP-A and the IL-33 decoy receptor sST2 offer novel alternatives to reduce
exacerbations due to viral infections in asthma. Use of human samples is critical as animal models of SARS-
CoV-2, influenza and RVC are limited, and translational of findings to human disease can be variable. Therefore,
the goal of the Clinical Core is to provide services for our AADCRC investigators to perform safe, consistent
procedures in research participants for phenotyping and standardized, high quality collection of biologic airway
and peripheral systemic specimens, cost effective sample processing and data collection, with robust data
management and statistical analysis to test the hypotheses presented in each project. This Clinical Core will
extensively phenotype 100 participants comprised of 60 asthma (30 mild, and 30 severe) patients and 40 controls
(25 atopic, 15 non-atopic) for lung function testing, type 2 phenotyping, genotyping, nasal sampling, and to
participate in the bronchoscopy studies to understand the effectiveness of these innate immune modulators in
asthma and atopy, and in mild and severe asthma. The Clinical Core will coordinate and perform bronchoscopy
with bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal and epithelial cell brushings, and endobronchial biopsy on all participants.
The Clinical Core will be responsible for processing, storing, and distributing all samples collected from
participants, to each of the three projects. In this capacity, the Core will allow each clinical sample to be utilized
to its full potential and serve all projects equally. For all of the studies within the AADCRC utilizing human subject
samples, the Clinical Core will also be responsible for assuring patient safety, data confidentiality and full
regulatory compliance. A Biostatistics Unit is embedded in this core to integrate the clinical data with the
molecular/biomarker data to effectively model relationships between cellular features and clinical phenotypes in
asthma."
10880393,"GENETICALLY MODIFIED MOUSE MODEL SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY 
Construction of transgenic and gene-targeted mice is an essential technology for cancer research, and the 
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) has a long history of leadership in this field. Directed 
by Franklin Costantini, PhD, a pioneer in transgenic mouse technology, the Genetically Modified Mouse Model 
Shared Resource (GMMMSR) makes transgenic and gene targeting technologies accessible to HICCC 
members, generating hundreds of new genetically modified mouse strains. Services include: (1) generation 
of conventional and large construct (BAC) transgenics, (2) embryonic stem cell targeting and generation of 
knockout (KO) and knock-in mice, (3) generation of conditional KO mice, and (4) generation of CRISPR- 
based KO and knock-in strains.These comprehensive services are broadly used by HICCC members for the 
in vivo functional characterization of oncogenes and tumor supressors. During the current project period 
(2014-2019), GMMMSR incorporated CRISPR genome editing services to generate mouse lines with 
deletions, point mutations, and more complicated genetic manipulations such as exon swapping and reporter 
knock-in. The diversity of services provided and the unique technical expertise, easy accessibility and high 
cost-effectiveness of the GMMMSR make it the provider of choice for generation of genetically manipulated 
mouse models by HICCC members. The GMMMSR is invariably ranked as one of the most highly valued 
resources at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in annual users’ surveys. The GMMSR provides 
services that are not available from commercial sources (e.g., recombinant BAC transgenics) and not easily 
accessible at other sites, and that are of central importance to the research of numerous HICCC members. 
The GMMMSR has the capability to engineer novel mouse lines in about 10 months; and CRISPR-based 
gene targeting services can deliver a new genetically modified line in about three months. In addition, mouse 
lines generated by GMMMSR are transferred to HICCC members without a lengthy quarantine process, 
further accelerating and empowering HICCC member research. In addition to these advanced transgenic and 
gene targeting services, the GMMMSR offers investigators training, advice and assistance in the design of 
transgenes, gene-targeting vectors and CRISPR gene editing, mouse breeding, and the interpretation of 
experimental results. The GMMMSR will continue to incorporate novel technologies, to provide state-of-the- 
art transgenic and gene-editing services, and to promote high value and accessibility through service and 
consulting, with the goal of empowering the Research Programs of HICCC members. Over the current project 
period, the capabilities of the GMMMSR were utilized by 39 HICCC members, supported key data and insights 
for 28 HICCC member peer-reviewed publications, including15 papers with impact factor >10, of which nine 
are in journals with an impact factor >20 (Nature, Nature Medicine, Cancer Discovery and Cancer Cell), and 
currently supports research 13 NIH-funded research project grants (10 from NCI)."
10849912,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) play a major role in causing asthma exacerbations, which drive disease and economic
burdens. Among the RVs the RV-C subgroup is especially problematic, due to its virulence. This proposal
is focused on RV-C, and ameliorating its effects with anti-viral agents derived from pulmonary surfactant lipids
and proteins. Two minor anionic phospholipids of pulmonary surfactant, palmitoyl-oleoyl-
phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), antagonize respiratory viral infections and
suppress inflammatory sequelae triggered by Toll-like receptor activation, by acting as decoy ligands.
In addition, the pulmonary surfactant protein, SP-A, also disrupts RV-C infections, in part by direct
interactions with virions. In this proposal we plan to investigate the mechanisms by which surfactant lipids
and proteins inhibit RV infections and replication. In Aim 1, we will examine how POPG and PI and their structural
analogs interfere with RV-C infection/replication using Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) cultures. Our current data
support a mechanism in which the lipids act intracellularly to alter the infection/replication processes. Indeed,
preliminary RNAseq data suggest that PI interferes with ciliagenesis, rendering host cells refractory to being
infected; since infection requires mature, motile cilia. The same RNAseq data set also suggests that POPG acts
at a different intracellular site from PI. Transgenic mouse studies are also proposed in Aim 1 and will investigate
the efficacy of the anti-viral phospholipids in the context of the whole organism. In Aim 2, we will investigate how
SP-A disrupts RV-C infection/replication using Air-Liquid-interface cultures ex vivo. We will also perform RNAseq
analysis to probe the host cell and viral transcriptomes. We will use our collection of purified SP-A isoforms to
determine the rank order potency of different SP-A structural variants both ex vivo and in vivo. The ex vivo SP-
A studies will be expanded to studies in transgenic mice to understand the actions of SP-A in the context of an
intact lung and whole animal. From the experiments described in this proposal we anticipate learning the
mechanisms of action of surfactant lipids and proteins as anti-viral agents targeting RVs that aggravate asthma
and cause exacerbations. We expect this information will identify novel reagents for controlling RV infections
in humans, and lead to new data that will improve the actions of the surfactant constituents."
10849915,"The goal of Project 2 is to determine how Tollip protects airways from viral infection and IL-33 signaling during
asthma exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory infection of viruses (e.g., influenza
virus) remain a significant challenge due to lack of effective antiviral therapy. These viruses primarily infect
human airway epithelium. The mechanisms underlying viral infection, tissue injury and inflammation have not
been well understood. In this project, we will focus on the role of a multifunctional immune regulator Toll-
interacting protein (Tollip) in viral infection, particularly influenza A virus (IAV) as it represents a more severe
form of viral infection in asthma. One of the key cytokines involved in asthma pathogenesis is IL-33, which is
expressed by airway epithelial cells and other structural cells, and can be released during tissue injury following
viral infection. Through binding to membrane-bound receptor ST2L, IL-33 exerts a variety of functions involved
in asthma pathogenesis. By using a Tollip knockout mouse model of IAV infection, we discovered that Tollip
deficiency increased lung viral load, loss of body weight, airway neutrophilic inflammation and importantly the
release of cleaved IL-33 into the airway lumen. Mechanistically, Tollip deficiency delayed airway epithelial wound
healing, reduced the production of IL-33 decoy receptor soluble ST2 (sST2), and increased mucous goblet cells
expressing ST2L in IL-13-stimulated airway epithelial cells. We hereby hypothesize that Tollip is protective
against viral exacerbations of asthma by inhibiting the IL-33 signaling. In Aim 1, we will define the role of
Tollip in IL-33 release and activation during viral infection in airways with type 2 inflammation by testing if Tollip
is protective against airway epithelial injury by promoting epithelial wound healing and reducing ATP release
during respiratory viral infection in human airway epithelial cells and mouse models with type 2 inflammation. In
Aim 2, we will determine sST2 regulation by Tollip during viral infection in airways with type 2 inflammation by
testing if Tollip increases transcriptional activity of the ST2 proximal promoter to induce sST2 expression in part
through inhibiting activation of STAT3. In Aim 3, we will determine ST2L regulation by Tollip during viral infection
in airways with type 2 inflammation by testing if Tollip inhibits ST2L expression by reducing mucous goblet cells
in airway epithelial cells exposed to IL-13/IL-33 and IAV. The proposed studies in Project 2 will reveal novel
mechanisms by which Tollip deficiency due to genetic and/or environmental factors promotes airway injury and
inflammation in a type 2 inflammation setting. sST2 or agents to reduce released ATP function/activity may serve
as a therapy to correct the detrimental effect of Tollip deficiency-mediated IL-33 signaling in airways during viral
exacerbations of asthma."
10849919,"During the first cycle of our AADCRC program, our project focused primarily on Surfactant Protein A (SP-A), a
known innate immune modulator that exhibits important anti-inflammatory effects in asthma. In this renewal, we
show preliminary data that SP-A binds the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor and disrupts IL-6 signaling, events relevant
to specific asthma phenotypes. While this work was progressing, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-
related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-driven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged and has
fundamentally changed our world. Elevated serum IL-6 is a hallmark of the “cytokine storm” associated with
severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress and IL-6 inhibitors show promise as treatments. Our data suggest
that SP-A exhibits innate functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting IL-6 signaling intermediates
and also by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry
into host cells. These findings suggest that SP-A may attenuate the inappropriate innate immune responses
in COVID-19 and by this mechanism, could play a role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several
chronic lung-based comorbidities have been shown to increase the severity and mortality associated with
COVID-19 - with the notable exception of asthma. Evidence from our group suggests that type-2 (T2) cytokines
such as IL-4 and IL-13, which are critical molecular underpinnings of atopic asthma, reduce ACE2 expression in
airway epithelial cells from T2 asthma. These findings suggest that atopic asthma-associated T2 cytokines
protect against COVID-19 by modulating infection. In this AADCRC renewal, we will build on these
preliminary data and merge two complementary, unique lines of investigation to expand the focus of our proposal
and investigate the interplay of SP-A and T2 cytokines at both the initiation and the effector stages of SARS-
CoV-2 respiratory tract infection in asthma. We will test the novel hypothesis that SP-A effectively limits COVID-
19 by decreasing ACE2-mediated events through direct receptor binding and inhibition of IL-6 signaling
pathways. In the setting of atopic asthma, type-2 cytokines may reduce the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-
2 infection by inhibiting ACE2 expression and function. In aim 1, we will determine the impact of SP-A in
limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection of human nasal, bronchial and distal airway epithelial cells and whether these
effects depend upon ACE2 binding and modulation of IL-6 signaling. In aim 2, we will assess ACE2 expression
in nasal, bronchial and distal epithelial cells from normal atopic and non-atopic controls and T2 asthmatic
participants, and determine how T2 cytokines and virus-induced interferons interact to regulate epithelial cell
ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cells. We hypothesize that SP-A and T2 cytokines can
synergize to dampen both the initiation and the effector phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby protecting
from COVID-19. This proposal leverages expertise in asthma, SP-A immune responses, virology and epithelial
biology within the project and synergizes well with Projects 1 and 2 to better understand viral insults in asthma."

10897206,"SUMMARY - Acetyl CoA Carboxylase in the Metabolic Control of Inflammation
Metabolic adaptation is central to both the induction and resolution of inflammation, and immune cells such as
macrophages must rapidly rewire their cellular metabolism to successfully carry out effector functions. Signaling
through pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like and interferon receptors, results in a switch to aerobic
glycolysis and increased glucose demand, with concomitant downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and
lipid beta-oxidation. Paradoxically, there is also an increase in lipid biosynthesis in response to pathogens, which
results in accumulation of excess lipid in macrophages. Metabolic dysregulation in macrophages results in either
compromised or overshooting immune responses, resulting in devastating outcomes in resolution of infections.
Patients with preexisting conditions such as obesity and diabetes are particularly at risk to inadequately respond
to and resolve viral and bacterial infections. Despite major advances in our understanding of immunometabolism,
the role of de novo lipogenesis and the etiology of metabolic dysregulation in inflammatory macrophages remains
unclear. Our preliminary studies unexpectedly identify Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) as a key enzyme
regulating the inflammatory response in macrophages, providing an opportunity to investigate the link between
lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in immune cells. ACC is a central enzyme directly regulating de
novo lipogenesis as well as indirectly affecting transcriptional capacity by regulating acetyl-CoA levels and thus
histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. ACC inhibitors (Firsocostat) are used in clinical trials against
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, a role for ACC in the control of the inflammatory response has
not been reported. To test the overall hypothesis that ACC activity is essential for the immune cell-intrinsic
metabolic and transcriptional adaptations required for the induction and resolution of acute inflammation, we
propose two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that ACC activity regulates induction and
resolution of the acute inflammatory response in mice, using genetic and pharmacologic approaches including
novel macrophage-specific ACCDKO mice, and by creating macrophage-specific Acacb and Acacb deficient mice.
Specific Aim 2 will identify the conserved transcriptional, metabolic, and functional mechanisms underlying ACC-
dependent induction and resolution of inflammation. Successful completion of these studies will identify a novel
role for ACC in controlling inflammation and resolution during innate immune responses and discover
evolutionarily conserved and individual functions of ACC1 and ACC2 isoforms."
10841649,"SUSTAINED REGULATION OF HYPOTHALAMUS-PITUITARY-OVARY HORMONES WITH TISSUE-
 ENGINEERED OVARIAN CONSTRUCTS AS A TREATMENT FOR OSTEOPOROSIS IN FEMALES
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Females are disproportionately affected by osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture. In the U.S., approximately
40 million women have or are at risk of developing osteoporosis and the majority (~ 60%) of the 2 million
osteoporotic bone fractures (direct costs > $20 billion per year) occur in women. Women have a 1-in-2 lifetime
chance of having an osteoporotic fracture and a 4-fold higher rate of osteoporosis than men. A key underlying
cause is ovarian failure due to menopause or other conditions that lead to loss of ovarian hormones with
concomitant disruption of the hypothalamus-ovary-pituitary (HPO) axis.
Until 2002, traditional pharmacological hormone therapy (pHT) was widely used due to its perceived ability to
reduce risk of osteoporosis and, importantly, osteoporotic fracture. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) verified
this long-held belief, demonstrating that pHT reduced incidence of osteoporotic fracture. However, the WHI also
indicated that the risks of hormone therapy, such as cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer,
outweighed the benefits of reduced levels of osteoporosis. Follow-on studies indicate that risks may be higher
in women older than 60 years of age and/or more than 10 years post-menopause, suggesting that hormone
therapy may still be effective if given at lower, safer doses and via suitable delivery platforms.
We propose biomimetic, ovarian cell constructs as a tissue engineering approach to hormone delivery (cellular
hormone therapy; cHT) in the treatment of osteoporosis. The hypothesis guiding this research is that cHT can
achieve better bone health and safety outcomes than pharmacological agents, such as pHT or the
bisphosphonates, in ovarian failure because it mimics native ovarian structure and function.
Our cHT approach uses a spatial arrangement of two key ovarian cell types (granulosa and theca cells) that
mimics native ovarian follicle structure while avoiding pitfalls of whole ovarian tissue encapsulation such as
oocyte (egg) expulsion and loss of function with time. Our system has achieved sustained and physiologically-
relevant levels of ovarian hormone secretion. We have demonstrated that the encapsulated ovarian cells
participate in the HPO axis, as evidenced by regulation of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH) levels from the anterior pituitary. There are fundamental differences between our cHT constructs
and the native ovary (e.g., lack of oocytes in our constructs) but ovarian, pituitary, and possibly hypothalamic
hormones are regulated in a manner similar to a pre-ovarian failure state. These cell-based constructs also
release other hormones naturally secreted by native ovaries but not present in pHT. More importantly, cHT
achieved beneficial bone outcomes in a manner that was safer than pHT.
The long-term goal of this research is to develop a cell-based therapy that can be used in humans for the
prevention of osteoporosis associated with loss of ovarian function in women. In our preliminary studies, we have
assessed cHT by using isogeneic cells in a rat model. However, to achieve clinical translation it is necessary to
(1) understand how the cHT dose and timing of implantation affects safety and bone health, (2) identify suitable
human, allogeneic, and/or xenogeneic cell sources for cHT and (3) understand how cHT achieves its effects at
both a cellular and systemic level. We will also determine the maximum duration of time that cHT can secrete
ovarian hormones and regulate other hormones of the HPO axis.
The proposed experiments will be conducted primarily in a rat surgical model of ovarian failure to induce
osteoporosis (ovariectomy; ovx). However, as a first step towards clinical translation we also propose the use of
a larger, rabbit model of ovarian failure and osteoporosis (ovx with glucocorticoid delivery). cHT will be directly
compared to pHT and to alendronate, a bisphosphonate drug widely prescribed to treat osteoporosis. We will
also compare cHT (and controls) to untreated ovx animals and to rats that have not received an ovx (healthy,
age-matched rats). We will propose three experimental aims:
Aim 1. Determine effect of isogeneic cHT dose and implant timing on HPO hormone levels, safety and
bone health in rat ovx model.
Aim 2. Assess HPO hormone levels, immune response, safety and bone health in two ovarian failure
models of osteoporosis with isogeneic, allogeneic or human cHT treatment.
Aim 3. Determine differential gene expression (DGE) profiles for isogeneic, allogeneic, and human cHT
to identify key functional pathways and any time-dependent changes in vitro and in a rat ovx model.
Completion of these studies will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these tissue-engineered constructs as a
potential treatment for osteoporosis and provide information on their mechanisms of action."
10764322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The ability of bacteria to rapidly sense and respond to changes in the environment is fundamental
to colonization. Post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as an important strategy that promotes
efficient and precise control of bacterial virulence, and thus plays a central role in pathogenesis.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) is a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the
human colon and causes severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which
can be fatal. EHEC is able to efficiently acquire nutrients and coordinate expression of traits that
promote intestinal colonization, suggesting that EHEC has evolved mechanisms to spatiotemporally
control virulence gene expression to occur within appropriate host niches. RNA binding proteins play
important roles in bacterial gene expression by modulating transcription termination, RNA stability,
and translation; however, the targets and molecular mechanisms of most RNA binding proteins and
the corresponding impact on bacterial virulence and host interactions are poorly resolved. The
proposed work will elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of RNA binding proteins and importance to
fitness within the intestine, as well as examine how these RNA binding proteins are activated within
transcriptional networks and in response to host cues."
10878858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulated gene expression is a widespread and disease-agnostic driver of human illness. Therefore, the
ability to understand and precisely control gene expression has the potential to revolutionize the therapeutic
landscape. The expression of human genes is naturally controlled by an elegant convergence of regulatory
forces, including the physical compaction of chromatin, post-translational modifications (PTMs) to histone
proteins, DNA methylation, and the dynamic engagement between transcription factors and chromatin modifying
proteins and the human genome. Although this coordinated control safeguards the balance between health and
disease, our mechanistic understanding of how these regulatory forces unite to drive human gene expression,
and how they can be predictably redesigned for new therapies, remains limited.
Programmable epigenome editing tools based upon nuclease null CRISPR/Cas-based systems have recently
emerged and enable new ways to control endogenous human gene expression and covalent modifications to
native chromatin. Despite this exciting progress, major technological and conceptual gaps remain. For instance,
it is mechanistically unclear how the expression levels of specific genes can be precisely tuned over wide ranges
in human cells. In addition, it is incompletely understood why the same transcription factors and chromatin
modifiers have different effects when localized to specific regulatory elements in different human cell types.
Further, the spatiotemporal stability and functional durations of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers at
different genomic loci are not well defined.
The goal of this MIRA project is to overcome these conceptual and technological gaps by developing and
combining diverse CRISPR/Cas-based transcription factors and chromatin modifiers with bulk and single cell
epigenomics and sensitive proteomics. We will use this multidisciplinary approach to answer fundamental
questions about human gene regulatory mechanisms including: (1) How can human gene expression be site-
specifically controlled at the resolution observed in health and disease? (2) What are the causal functions and
operational stabilities of diverse chromatin modifications? (3) To what extent does chromatin compaction,
modification state, protein complex composition, and spatial proximity affect the function of transcription factors
and chromatin modifiers? Altogether, our proposal has great potential to uncover and enable control over pivotal
mechanisms with broad and significant importance to human health."
10883576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Meniscal tears are the most commonly reported knee injuries, and approximately 1 million surgeries involving
the meniscus are performed annually in the US. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches are
being actively pursued as potential alternatives to overcome limitations of current clinical treatments. Yet, the
translation of these approaches to clinical application has been hampered by their limited ability to efficiently and
reproducibly create physiologic-sized scaffolds featuring anisotropic structural and mechanical properties on the
order of native meniscus and zone-specific biological cues provided by the ECM. The overall goals of this
proposal are to 1) develop a scaffold that recapitulates the complex structural and mechanical characteristics of
the meniscus at multiple scales and incorporates zone-specific ECM cues and 2) assess the long-term function
of such scaffolds and their ability to prevent joint degeneration in-vivo. We will use a new high-throughput hybrid
approach of 3D Melt Blowing (3DMB) in conjunction with Solution Blowing (SB) that synergistically integrates
attributes of traditional nonwovens techniques and 3D printing to create a scaffold featuring macro-geometry,
fibrous microarchitecture, and zonal biological cues (meniscus-derived ECM (mECM)) to match the native
meniscus. We hypothesize that both biomechanics and mECM cues need to be similar to the meniscus to
achieve superior in-vivo outcomes, primarily, reduced cartilage degeneration. Aim 1 is to determine how primary
3DMB and SB process variables influence the structural architecture and biomechanical properties of
anatomically-sized meniscus scaffolds made of selected biopolymers and mECM. Aim 2 is to determine whether
the incorporation of zone-specific mECM improves infiltration and tissue formation by cells as well as integration
with the surrounding meniscus tissue. Aim 3 is to determine whether cartilage degeneration following partial
meniscectomy is reduced through the addition of an appropriate mECM formulation within scaffolds with
meniscus-matched mechanics. On completion, this project will provide fundamental knowledge about the micro-
and macro-level process-structure-function relationships in meniscus-relevant bioactive scaffolds fabricated
using our new nonwovens approach, and will serve as a base technology of great significance allowing advances
in the treatment of orthopaedic fibrous soft tissue injuries."
10846593,"DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways resolve DNA lesions that arise during cellular
metabolism or as the by-product of cell damage. Human DSB repair pathways fall into two distinct categories:
end joining (EJ) pathways that rejoin the DSB molecule, and homology directed repair (HDR) pathways that use
a template molecule to repair the DSB molecule. The factors that cells use to decide between EJ and HDR repair
pathways remain incompletely defined. Many studies have shown that the cell cycle regulates DSB pathway
choice, yet cultures arrested at points in the cell cycle that favor HDR still repair the majority of DSBs using EJ.
The long-term goal of the research in my lab is to comprehensively define factors that bias DSB repair in sufficient
detail that we can predict DSB repair outcomes based on the initial conditions inside a cell. Pursuit of this goal
will improve our understanding of DNA repair and related processes, enable new generations of gene editing
reagents with greatly increased efficacy, and suggest new strategies to diagnose and treat human DNA repair
pathologies, including cancer and aging.
 Over the next five years, we will develop a holistic model for DSB repair that describes DNA repair events
occurring on the DSB and template molecules. Our goals in generating this model are to define the irreversible
commitment step between EJ/HDR and to understand if cells sense their capacity to perform HDR before they
pass commitment. These are important challenges for the cell, because inappropriate HDR can cause cell death
or genomic instability. We hypothesize that cells have the heretofore unmeasured ability to develop DSB repair
complexes in parallel, and that parallel maturation of DSB repair complexes plays a role both in the EJ/HDR
commitment and as a checkpoint for these repair pathways. Parallel development of EJ and HDR complexes
either on the DSB molecule or split between the DSB and template molecule would allow cells to simultaneously
develop different types of repair before committing to one or the other. The ability to generate mature repair
complexes prior to commitment would make DNA repair substantially less risky. Our practical approach is to
develop genomic and proteomic techniques that allow us to measure DSB repair intermediates with
unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We will use these techniques to define how protein complexes
associate with chromatin over time and, crucially, the strandedness of DNA bound to DSB repair proteins.
Measuring this latter parameter will allow us to determine when events occur in relation to the EJ/HDR decision
and thus understand when and how this decision is made. We also explore mechanisms of communication
between multiple DSB repair complexes assembled in parallel onto chromatin. Parallel events are especially
informative because they indicate a dynamic system in which cells simultaneously explore multiple DSB repair
pathways, thereby preserving choice until repair is nearly complete. For example, events on the template
molecule may act as a checkpoint for events on the DSB molecule, or vice versa.
 This work will enable new tools that leverage our understanding of DSB repair to influence gene editing
outcomes and to improve therapeutic workflows. We also anticipate that our work will open new fields of inquiry,
for example defining how DSB repair complexes assembled interact with each other and with cell-wide signaling
mechanisms."
10842374,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) represent an opportunity for early detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
The accurate identification of cysts with high grade dysplasia or invasive adenocarcinoma, together referred to
as “Advanced Neoplasia” (AN), that warrant surgical intervention represents a critical unmet need in the
management of PCLs. Most pancreatic cysts with the potential to develop AN are mucinous; in contrast, non-
mucinous PCLs have little or no malignant potential. Biochemical and cytological analysis of aspirated cyst
fluid are important tools in the diagnosis and risk stratification of PCLs. However, sensitivity of the only clinical
biomarker for mucinous cysts, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is insufficient to allow clinicians to confidently
remove patients from surgical consideration. Moreover, the most commonly performed CEA assay requires
500 L of fluid, which is often unavailable. For over 50% of patients that undergo invasive trans-gastric cyst
fluid aspiration, inadequate biospecimen is obtained to run the standard of care biochemical tests. In an effort
to improve the sensitivity and applicability of cyst fluid analysis, we used our novel multiplex mass
spectrometry technology to identify the protease gastricsin which accurately identifies mucinous cysts with an
AUC of 0.98 and requires only 5 L fluid. Despite reliance by clinicians on these analyses to guide clinical
decision-making, little effort has been directed toward optimization of biospecimen processing for pancreatic
cyst fluid. There are no standardized pathways for cyst fluid processing and, unlike other biospecimens such
as serum, pancreatic cyst fluid has variable viscosity and contamination with blood and proteinaceous material
that could interfere with assay reproducibility. It is unknown if the variability we observe clinically in cyst fluid
CEA and cytology reflects true biological differences or inconsistent preanalytical biospecimen processing. The
overall objective of this proposal is to improve completeness, reproducibility, and accuracy in
pancreatic cyst fluid diagnostic evaluation in order to improve the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
while avoiding the burdens of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. To achieve our objective, we will
systematically evaluate the impact of preanalytical variables on cyst fluid biochemical and cytological analysis
(Aim 1) and identify strategies to mitigate the small volumes of available cyst fluid (Aim 2) in order to develop
a streamlined, reproducible protocol (Aim 3) that improves the reliable early detection of pancreatic cancer.
We will then validate the performance of our streamlined protocol using prospectively - collected clinical
samples, and we will evaluate inter-assay variability by implementing the protocols at two independent sites.
By improving the reliability of our assays, clinicians will be able to direct surgical intervention appropriately to
patients with incipient pancreatic cancer while sparing others unnecessary risks of mortality, substantial
morbidity, and health care costs."
10796934,"SUMMARY
Inositol phosphates are critical signaling messengers involved in a wide range of biological pathways in which
inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) functions as a rate limiting enzyme for inositol polyphosphate
metabolism. Many laboratories including ours have studied the biology of IPMK mostly in cellular models. IPMK
has been implicated in metabolism but its tissue-specific function at the systemic level is poorly understood.
IPMK is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, and the levels are increased with exercise and decreased in
diabetes. Skeletal muscle is a major contributor to energy homeostasis, therefore, we have developed mouse
and cellular models to elucidate metabolic mechanisms of IPMK. We have found that mice in which IPMK is
specifically deleted in skeletal muscle (MKO) displayed disrupted nutrient utilization, impaired glucose tolerance
and reduced exercise tolerance compared to the control mice. Moreover, global metabolic and biochemical
analyses revealed disrupted mitochondrial functions, reduced beta-oxidation and impaired insulin response in
ipmk deficient muscle cells. In addition, we found that IPMK regulates the levels of acetylation via histone protein
deacetylases, which plays a key role in metabolism. Based on our previous research and preliminary data, we
hypothesize that skeletal muscle IPMK plays critical roles in nutrient utilization and energy homeostasis. We
propose four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the in vivo actions of muscle IPMK on fuel utilization at
rest and during exercise. In Aim 2, we will examine how muscle IPMK regulates whole-body metabolism and its
response to exercise. In Aim 3, we will investigate how IPMK regulates nutrient utilization in myocytes using
biochemical, cellular and molecular approaches combined with chemical genetics to modulate IPMK activity. In
Aim 4, we will investigate the transcriptional mechanisms by which IPMK modulates energy utilization using
biochemical, transcriptomic and bioinformatic approaches. Together, this project is expected to advance the field
by filling a critical gap in understanding of the biology of IPMK in energy homeostasis. Our proposed studies will
illuminate the key functions of skeletal muscle in metabolism and could potentially lead to the development of
new therapies for diabetes, obesity and related diseases."
10831839,"The proposed VA Career Development Award (CDA-1) is designed to provide support and mentorship for the
PI, Dr. Gabrielle Scronce, to become a successful, independent VA investigator improving the lives of Veteran
stroke survivors. Dr. Scronce obtained her Doctor of Physical Therapy and PhD in Human Movement Science
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is currently a WOC researcher at the Ralph H. Johnson
VAMC and a postdoctoral scholar at the Medical University of South Carolina under the primary mentorship of
Dr. Na Jin Seo. The PI’s career and research training goals are influenced by her experience as a physical
therapist working with Veterans and active duty service members, as these interactions have allowed her to
appreciate the unique strengths and needs of these individuals that are insufficiently understood and addressed
by standard physical therapy practice. Specifically, her training goals are to develop the foundation for
psychosocial factors and behavioral interventions to improve Veterans’ adherence to home exercise programs
(HEP), enhance skills in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research, develop proficiency in clinical
trial design and management for stroke rehabilitation, and advance her professional development through
grantsmanship, publications, scientific presentations, mentorship, and community engagement. The
interprofessional team of mentors in this CDA-1 is well-suited to guide the PI as she works towards achieving
her training goals. This CDA-1 adds new mentorship to Dr. Scronce from Dr. Lisa McTeague in psychosocial
factors/measures and behavioral interventions, from Dr. Jillian Harvey in qualitative and mixed methods
research, and from Dr. Viswanathan Ramakrishnan in quantitative research. In this CDA-1, Dr. Scronce will
continue to receive mentorship from Dr. Seo with the addition of training in objective accelerometry to track HEP
adherence. The study Dr. Scronce has proposed in this CDA-1 addresses the important problem of inadequate
adherence to upper extremity (UE) HEP among stroke survivors, a problem that limits recovery and survivors’
subsequent ability to participate in desired activities. The objective of this study is to explain how modifiable
psychosocial factors manifest themselves in terms of barriers and facilitators for HEP adherence among Veteran
stroke survivors. This objective will be met through an observational study with mixed-methods design in which
Veterans with UE impairment after stroke will be asked to complete objective measures of modifiable
psychosocial factors, complete a HEP for 7 days during which adherence will be objectively monitored, and
participate in semi-structured interviews to share barriers and facilitators to HEP adherence. Quantitative findings
relating psychosocial factors with HEP adherence and qualitative findings from the semi-structured interview will
be integrated to elucidate the relationship among psychosocial factors, barriers and facilitators for HEP
adherence, and objective HEP adherence level. The long-term goal is to use the results of this study to develop
a new enhanced behavioral intervention that can be delivered within a rehabilitation visit and that targets
individual Veterans’ psychosocial factors to increase adherence to HEP, ultimately improving UE recovery in
Veteran stroke survivors."
10922722,"Transcription regulation is a key determinant of how genetic variability is interpreted by a cell: more than 90%
of traits- and disease-associated genetic variants map outside of the coding genome. While we now have a
robust understanding of where human TFs might bind, enabling predictions of TF binding when data is
unavailable, those approaches do not tell us how frequently a TF binds, how long it stays bound, and what it
does once bound, which makes it difficult to predict the impact that TF or regulatory site variants will have on
transcription.
Critical regulatory architectures, primarily studied with activators, typically favor transient, lower affinity
interactions between regulators and the DNA over stronger ones. This is consistent with observations that the
transcription machinery can load very efficiently, within seconds. Whether similar strategies are adopted by
repressors is unclear, given the much longer timescales over which repression unfolds.
In this proposal, we will build upon a novel AI-based Zinc Finger design model to engineer synthetic mimics of
endogenous DNA binding domains that bind arbitrary sequences with tunable affinity and measure their
binding kinetics in reconstituted assays. We will deploy cutting-edge single-molecule tracking microscopy in
order to measure the binding kinetics of these domains to their targets and at non-specific site inside living
cells. These experiments will enable reconstructing the strategies deployed by Transcription Factors to find
their targets in the genome haystack.
We will fuse these DNA binding domains with activating or repressing domains in order to directly link
Transcription Factor binding kinetics to the timing and output of transcription bursts synthesized by their target
genes. Together, these data will provide mechanistic access to the strategies that repressors and activators
have evolved to find and regulate their targets. The results constitute key design principles for novel
biotechnologies based on Transcription Factor reprogramming."

The US opioid epidemic has put a significant burden on Veterans and the VA. Veterans often suffer from
chronic pain syndromes due to war injuries, toxic exposures, and deployment-related psychiatric comorbidities
and are vulnerable to opioid use/misuse. Chronic pain syndromes occur in 65.4% of U.S. veterans, 9.1% of it
severe, as against 56 and 6.4% in non-veterans respectively. Both opioid misuse and unrelieved pain have
been linked to a higher risk of suicide among Veterans, greater among women. To address the opioid epidemic
in the VA, in August 2013, the VA deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) to ensure that opioids are used in
a safe, effective, and judicious manner and the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Management (STORM).
Although the implementation of OSI has substantially reduced risky and other opioid prescriptions in VHA and
increased use of non-opioid treatments for pain, there remain major gaps in evidence to formulate
comprehensive policy as current data is almost exclusively derived from Veterans receiving care within the
VHA. This is important as ~80% of the Veterans have private health insurance. It has been reported that
Veterans who receive dual VHA and non-VHA care received more opioid prescriptions and more risky
prescriptions, that mono VHA users. Also, while opioid overdose rates have been increasing in VHA enrollees
VHA Opioid prescriptions in these veterans declined. To address the prescription drug misuse problem, states
use Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), which are electronic databases that collect and track
prescription data on controlled substances to reduce their abuse and diversion. However, despite access to
these data via Health Information Exchanges (HIE), the guideline-discordant unsafe and concurrent
prescriptions and fillings of opioids continue. Also, PDMP data alone are not suitable for policy decisions and
practice recommendations as they lack the detailed clinical information necessary to make a comprehensive
evaluation of underlying factors associated with non-guideline-concordant prescriptions. Our preliminary data
show a decline in Opioid prescriptions with less decline in the diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder. The absence
of community data is also mentioned as a major deficiency in the study and analyses of the opioid misuse
crisis in a 2017 VA Office of Inspector General Report. In this VHA HSR&D Merit Review Application we
propose to examine factors associated with prescription opioid misuse, specifically the guideline-discordant
use of opioids, in 3 Veterans groups, (1) VHA mono-users, (2) VHA paid dual users of both VHA and non-VHA
care, and (3) non-VHA paid dual users. We also propose to conduct an interview/focus group study of VA and
non-VA community health providers perspectives on: a) barriers and facilitators in providing guideline-
concordant care to the dual users, and b) coordination strategies to reduce opioid misuse in the dual user
groups. These aims will be achieved by analyzing the complex data using novel deep learning and natural
language processing methods in addition to the state-of-the-art statistical methods. The data involved will
include the VHA and MedStar Health (largest healthcare system in the Mid-Atlantic region) electronic health
record (EHR), the Chesapeake Regional Information System for Patients (CRISP) and Medicare databases.
We will also bring together VA and non-VA community health providers, including clinicians, administrators,
policy makers, and patients. We have conducted preliminary studies and collected preliminary data to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed deep learning and natural language processing methods as well as
our access to VA and non-VA EHR data. The results of the proposed study will be shared with our VHA and
community operational partners. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate and improve care coordination and reduce
opioid misuse in Veterans who are dual users of VA and community care."

 A large portion of important drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates either originate from plants or are
synthesized from petrochemical-based products. Several natural products of significantly high value to human
life (e.g., antibiotics, pharmaceuticals like Artemisinin, anticancer agents like Taxol (paclitaxel) among others)
have been produced by organisms that are not optimal for industrial production. Although some of these natural
products can be chemically synthesized, the complex structures of several of these compounds makes chemical
synthesis difficult and commercially infeasible. As a result, there is increasing need to develop sustainable and
readily tractable technological platforms to synthesize these drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates. The
central objective of this proposal is to develop a sustainable technological platform that harnesses light energy
and biocatalysis to synthesize molecules of significant relevance to human life. We envision doing this by
establishing cyanobacterial endosymbionts within yeasts cells, such that the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
provide ATP and assimilated carbon (generated from photosynthesis) to the yeast cells, which utilize it to produce
biologically important natural products. This platform will allow us to couple the remarkable biosynthetic and
biocatalytic potential of yeast to the photosynthetic ability of cyanobacteria to develop a sustainable and simple
bioproduction platform to produce natural products of significant value to human life (vide infra). Premise: (i)
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been recently harnessed to produce high titers of biologically important
molecules such as amorphadiene and artemisinic acid, (precursors to Artemisinin) and taxadiene (a key
precursor to Taxol), (ii) we had previously developed model endosymbiosis between S. cerevisiae /E. coli to
study mitochondrial evolution are currently engineering yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis (preliminary data in
Specific Aim 1) and (iii) our preliminary data on engineering model yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis.
 In this proposal, we will focus on three key areas: (i) We have engineered experimental platform to
establish endosymbiosis between model cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus, and model budding yeast,
S. cerevisiae. We will expand this platform by engineering novel cyanobacterial mutants as putative
endosymbionts. We will extensively characterize the engineered yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis to develop
strategies to improve their stability, growth rate and homogeneity. (ii) We will create a metabolite-driven synthetic
communication system to control endosymbiosis and optimize our platform for metabolic engineering. (iii) We
will utilize our photosynthetic endosymbiotic platform to produce key precursors of FDA approved compounds,
Artemisinin and Taxol. These studies will be the first step towards our long-term goal of developing a
photosynthetic and genetically tractable endosymbiotic platform for the bioproduction of biologically important
novel natural products as well as molecules like biopolymers and biofuels."

Renal transplantation is widely recognized as the treatment of choice for children with end stage renal

children to grow well, develop almost normally and improve their school educational performance levels.
However, current data indicate that virtually all grafts in pediatric recipients will eventually fail due to chronic
allograft dysfunction, and as such, the goal of preserving long-term allograft function is the key area for
future progress. Furthermore, registry data indicate that opportunistic infections are now the most common
cause for hospitalization and death in the pediatric population. Little is known about pathogen-specific
protective immunity in pediatric recipients who are exposed to multiple novel infectious agents throughout
the post-transplant period in the absence of Tmemory. Our approach in this trial is based on the concept
that successful preservation of long-term allograft function requires an immunosuppressive regimen that
targets donor specific alloantibody (DSA) production while preserving pathogen-specific immunity. We also
propose that pediatric recipients require precision tools to monitor, identify and prevent silent subclinical
intragraft inflammation/rejection, which is common at early times in the post transplant period. Based on a
recent pilot study using de novo Belatacept therapy in combination with an mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) in
pediatric recipients, we will test the hypothesis that early introduction of a Belatacept/sirolimus maintenance
immunosuppressive regimen is safe and efficacious in children to augment immunoregulation, prevent DSA
production and enhance long-term allograft function. EBV seropositive primary renal transplant recipients,
aged between 6 and 21 yrs, from eleven experienced pediatric clinical centers will be randomized to receive
induction therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin and either Belatacept therapy in combination with sirolimus or
remain on standard immunosuppression therapy using tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Primary
endpoint analysis includes de novo DSA development and assessment of allograft function after 36 months
of follow up. Associated studies include surveillance monitoring using a novel automated point-of-care urine
biomarker assay, and in-depth mechanistic studies on the cellular basis for pathogen-specific immunity and
evaluation of functional antibody responses to vaccine. Extensive mechanistic studies will also be
performed to assess the impact of Belatacept/mTORi on cellular and humoral alloimmunity and the further
development of urinary biomarkers to differentiate subclinical rejection from infection. There are significant
unmet clinical needs in pediatric recipients who have unique pathogen-specific and alloimmune responses
following transplantation. Overall, the relevance of this proposal is that it builds upon previous trials to test if
a novel agent (Belatacept) targets allograft dysfunction; in-depth mechanistic monitoring will allow for the
prediction of patient course, and our findings will be applicable to recipients of other solid organ transplants."

Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have discovered complex disease-associated genetic
variants while at the same time whole genome sequencing studies have been identifying risk alleles for
Mendelian and complex diseases. These variants have the potential to shed light on human disease
mechanisms. But there are several important challenges. More than 90% of complex disease associated
variants lie within non-coding regions, posing a challenge of identifying relevant cell types and cell states,
target genes, and regulatory mechanisms. The important task of linking these variants to genes itself can be
challenging. In addition, as our ability to identify de novo and rare mutations for complex and Mendelian
diseases is rapidly expanding, defining the function of those de novo alleles, which genes and pathways they
affect remains uncertain.
 To address these challenges, we will predict the functional impact of disease risk variants at the level of
individual variants, individual genes, and pathways to elucidate disease biology. In all aims of this proposal we
will utilize IGVF functional genomic data. In Aim 1, we will predict the regulatory potential of variants in
disease-critical cell types/states at a single base-pair resolution. We will identify pathogenic cell-states by
analyzing single cell transcriptional data sets in a disease context, and then integrate single-cell epigenetic
data to define the regulatory landscape of these rare disease cell-states. These regulatory regions identified in
this analysis can be used to annotate variants for potential function. Finally, to understand functionality of
specific variants in regulatory regions, we quantify selective pressure using large-scale whole genome
sequencing data. In Aim 2, we will predict functional impacts of genes by effectively linking variants to genes.
Defining causal diseases genes is critically important since they may be important for therapeutic targeting. We
develop strategies to use genetic data and functional genomic data to predict downstream genes, and evaluate
these methods with a set of gold-standard casual genes from Mendelian phenotypes. In Aim 3, we focus on
rare and de novo mutations with large effect sizes. Here we recognize that predicting the function of these
alleles requires an understanding of the pathways they effect, models to connect rare non-coding variants to
genes, and strategies to define functionality of the variants based on population genetic parameters. In Aim 4,
we develop a framework to synergize with the IGVF consortium to advance consortium goals, outlining our
integration plan and flexible programmatic framework.
 The proposal represents a collaboration between Drs. Soumya Raychaudhuri, Alkes Price, and Shamil
Sunyaev, bringing analytical expertise across functional genomics, single-cell data integration, and population
genetics. These investigators have a history of successful collaborations with a strong publication records
integrating functional genomics data with GWAS and sequencing studies to uncover disease mechanisms."

Self-renewing cell populations accumulate somatic mutations with aging and/or in response to environmental
insult and chronic inflammation. Most of these mutations in normal tissues have no functional consequence. In
rare cases, these somatic mutations can confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion in
hematopoietic stem cells, a phenomenon termed 'Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential' (CHIP).
CHIP has been associated with a selective range of non-hematopoietic conditions, including coronary artery
disease, stroke, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver
diseases, and osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CHIP specifically promotes these
diseases remain largely unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to molecularly connect CHIP with
the development of associated diseases through developing and applying statistical and machine learning
methods to multi-omics data in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed), UK Biobank, and
Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB). Specifically, I propose the following aims. In Aim 1, I will develop a
statistical method that combines multiple proteins implicated in the same pathway to improve discovery and
facilitate translational insights for proteomics-based association analyses. The combined protein quantitative
traits generated by this method will be used in the following aims. In Aim 2, I will examine how the presence of
CHIP and each CHIP driver gene specifically promote certain diseases through (1) identifying the proteomic
signatures of CHIP and quantifying the mediation effects to associated diseases and (2) evaluating the
potential modifications of CHIP-associated diseases by the expression levels of genes implicated in diverse
molecular factors. In Aim 3, I will evaluate how the progression of CHIP promotes associated diseases. I will
examine associations between longitudinal change in the number and size of CHIP clones and incident
disease risks, as well as generate bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data among CHIP carriers with or
without osteoporosis, a disease strongly associated with CHIP but understudied, and test for differential gene
expressions between the two groups. This project's successful execution will identify the mechanisms
underlying CHIP-associated disease risks to prioritize therapeutic targets and advance precision medicine
goals."
10850973,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ABSTRACT
 There is no therapy that slows the progression of any symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD), a
progressive, age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than one million Americans. Although
reserved for later PD stages as an alternative when medications fail, deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy has
strong evidence that it protects nigral neurons when applied in animal models of early-stage PD. Those
promising preclinical studies motivated the first randomized clinical trial evaluating DBS in early-stage PD.
Recent findings from that pilot trial provided class II evidence that early DBS slows the progression of rest
tremor, a common and often distressing cardinal motor symptom for early-stage patients. This landmark finding
must now be prospectively tested, and a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial is approved by the FDA. Similar
to the pilot, the phase 3 trial will evaluate underlying motor symptom progression using week-long therapeutic
washouts. Since the original investigation completed, new objective measures to evaluate PD have emerged,
including PD-specific metabolic networks identified from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron electron
tomography (PET) scans and wearable biosensors that evaluate motor symptoms and dyskinesia. Including
these unbiased measures alongside standard clinical assessments after a week-long therapeutic washout
offers the opportunity to objectively evaluate whether early DBS slows PD progression compared to standard
medical therapy. Additionally, there were no safety issues during 147 washout experiences in the pilot, and
early-stage PD patients preserved their independence in activities of daily living throughout the washouts.
Given the mild symptomology of early-stage PD, conducting the washouts in the ambulatory setting may offer
a less burdensome and more cost-effective alternative. Before proceeding to a phase 3 trial, the feasibility of
making changes to the week-long washout protocol to add objective FDG-PET neuroimaging (Aim 1) and
wearable biosensors (Aim 2) while being conducted in the ambulatory setting (Aim 3) must first be tested. This
study will fill critical knowledge gaps concerning use of new objective measures during an outpatient washout
in 20 early-stage PD patients. This new information will be used to finalize the protocol of a phase 3 trial to
determine if early DBS slows Parkinson’s disease motor symptom progression compared to standard care.
 My career goal is to become an independent scientist who investigates new therapies for early-stage
Parkinson’s disease. I have identified four gaps in my training that, once filled, will accelerate my progress
toward that goal. These four areas are: 1) PD neural networks, 2) objective PD measurements, 3) health care
needs for older adults with neurological disorders, and 4) leading multidisciplinary clinical trials teams. I have
developed a training plan to overcome these barriers that integrates formal didactic training with one-on-one,
multidisciplinary mentorship in an outstanding research environment at Vanderbilt University. Completing the
proposed research and training plan will help me successfully compete for R01-level funding."
10890087,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a comprehensive 5-year mentored career development plan with the goal of training
the candidate to become a leading independent physician-scientist focused on improving the diagnostic
evaluation and management of pulmonary nodules (PNs) to optimize early detection of thoracic cancer and
minimize unnecessary harms to patients. The candidate is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow and
Attending Pulmonologist at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The proposal builds upon Dr. Kim’s previous
research training in epidemiology and biostatistics and clinical experience in thoracic oncology. PNs are
commonly detected by computed tomography (CT). Lung biopsy, a highly invasive procedure, is required for a
definitive diagnosis but carries significant risks and costs. Thus, clinicians face the diagnostic challenge of PN
malignancy risk estimation when deciding which patients should undergo a biopsy, and which should be
surveilled with repeat imaging. The overall goal of this project is to address the current inadequacy of
estimating malignancy risk within the diagnostic process of PN evaluation by assessing the clinical utility and
effectiveness of a radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool. This novel technology synthesizes
quantitative features from raw CT imaging data invisible to the human eye and has been previously
demonstrated by the candidate’s team to improve clinicians’ PN diagnostic accuracy. This project’s goal will be
accomplished via three complementary specific aims. In Aim 1, a retrospective cohort study will be performed
to determine the clinical utility of a CAD-based risk stratification strategy using net reclassification indices,
decision curve analysis, and relative utility curves. In Aim 2, a pilot, single-center pragmatic randomized clinical
trial will be conducted to compare the clinical effectiveness of a CAD-based risk stratification strategy to usual
care for appropriate management of PNs, defined as biopsy or empiric treatment for malignant PNs and
surveillance for benign PNs. Finally, in Aim 3, the cost-effectiveness of a CAD-based risk stratification strategy
will be evaluated using decision analytic models for a simulated cohort of individuals with newly detected PNs.
Dr. Kim has outlined a rigorous training plan of coursework, skills acquisition (with a focus on clinical utility
analysis, clinical trial design, decision analytic modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis), and professional
career development. To realize this vision, he has assembled a distinguished, multidisciplinary mentorship and
advisory team, led by his primary mentor, Dr. Anil Vachani, the Director of Clinical Research in the Section of
Interventional Pulmonology and Thoracic Oncology at Penn, and co-mentor, Dr. Katharine Rendle, Deputy
Director for Research at the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation. Penn provides an outstanding
intellectual, collaborative, and supportive environment for this proposal, positioning Dr. Kim to successfully
complete the aims and training plan so that he will be a competitive applicant for an R01 award to perform a
multicenter comparative effectiveness trial assessing PN malignancy risk stratification strategies."
10814843,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nutrition is an essential component in the care of critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) who are often limited in volitional intake and who incur new deficits in physical function secondary to
their illness. Despite well-characterized associations between inadequate nutrition and adverse outcomes,
large multicenter trials of specific nutrition strategies have failed to consistently demonstrate clinical benefit
with any particular approach. The landmark NHLBI-funded Early versus Delayed Enteral Nutrition [EDEN] trial
investigated low-level (trophic) versus full enteral feeds in 1000 patients and demonstrated increased
gastrointestinal complications with full enteral feeds without any clinical benefit. Subsequently, current
guidelines recommend low-level feeds for all ARDS patients, however, ARDS is increasingly recognized as a
heterogeneous disease and a one-size-fits-all approach may not be appropriate. An essential first step in
individualizing nutrition in ARDS is identifying the clinical and biologic variables that contribute to heterogeneity
of treatment effect whereby individuals or groups vary in response to treatment. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize differential responses to nutrition by leveraging data and biospecimens from the
EDEN trial. In Aim 1, this proposal will investigate whether ARDS subphenotypes differed in response to low-
level versus full enteral nutrition in EDEN. Recent studies have identified two distinct ARDS subphenotypes
that differ in prognosis, host response, and potentially in response to treatments. ARDS subphenotypes have
not been investigated with regards to nutrition. Thus, Aim 1 will perform biologic assays to facilitate ARDS
subphenotype identification and will test for differences by subphenotype in clinical outcomes, in intestinal
permeability, and in incretin hormones. When released at physiologic levels in response to enteral nutrients,
incretins have beneficial effects on insulin release and glucose metabolism, but when released at
supraphysiologic levels in response to intestinal inflammation, incretins may worsen tolerance to nutrition by
reducing gastric motility. Incretins are not well characterized in ARDS. In Aim 2, this proposal will use
computational approaches that directly model individual treatment effects based on patient covariates allowing
for investigations of treatment response that result from a complex interaction between baseline demographics,
severity of illness, endocrine hormones, and inflammation at an individual patient level. Successful completion
of the proposed Aims will provide new knowledge on biologic responses to nutrition strategies, identify
mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneity of treatment effect at an individual level, and provide direction for
the next generation of precision nutrition studies in ARDS."

 The mission of the Stanford Biophysics Program is to develop students with strong, interdisciplinary,
quantitative approaches to meaningful biological problems, while establishing a rigorous atmosphere of
inclusion, diversity, and high research conduct and ethics. To meet these goals, trainees participate in
coursework, mentored primary research, and other activities designed to enhance their training; together these
opportunities prepare graduates for the next step in their careers as part of the STEM workforce. The Program
requires graduate-level coursework in physical and biological sciences, participation in seminar series and the
retreat, and the development of a high level of proficiency in independent research. Faculty in this
interdepartmental predoctoral training program come from 21 departments in the Schools of Humanities and
Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Student training and
research centers on the application of physical and chemical principles and methods to biological problems, as
well as the development of new methods. The quantitative relationship between molecular properties and
higher-level cell/tissue properties is an increasing focus of the Program, as are emerging areas of quantitative
cell and organ biology. Overall, this training program capitalizes on student backgrounds and interests in the
physical sciences while fostering creative, collaborative, highly skilled approaches that span biological scales.
 Trainees are appointed upon admission to Stanford for up to 2 years; the 12 requested slots will generate
class sizes of 8-10 through university and externally funded fellowships. There are currently 59 students in the
Program (18.6% URMs), most with undergraduate backgrounds in physical science, biochemistry, or
engineering. Importantly, our recent efforts have led to diversification of the backgrounds of students in the
Biophysics Program through partnerships with a minority-serving institution (UC Merced) and summer research
programs that recruit URM students to Stanford. To maximize trainee retention, first-year advising by the
Program Director and annual meetings with each student’s thesis committee ensure that a balanced academic
program is tailored to the background of each student and that an acceptable level of performance is
maintained. Required IDP meetings with the advisor ensure career development and RCR/R&R instruction; the
latter is also provided through required coursework including a Statistics class and a variety of elective
offerings. Students are heavily involved in program activities, establishing a cohesive community; the Program
benefits from high levels of University support and engagement. The fundamental and applied research carried
out by our trainees is the cornerstone for developing drugs targeted to specific molecules, for understanding
the relationships between environmental stimuli and cell and tissue behavior, and for developing new methods
for detecting and treating diseases including cancer and neurological pathlogies."

 Revolutionary methods of acquiring electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of free radicals
create a paradigm shift in application of EPR to understanding the role of radicals in cancer and in other
diseases. Hitherto impossible studies are now feasible.
 Molecular oxygen, pH, local viscosity, distribution of probes, and general redox status of tissues are
crucial parameters to understand tumors, determine targets for radiation and chemotherapy, and to monitor
response to treatments. Lung damage, stroke, myocardial infarction, brain injury, wound healing, and other
trauma, and peripheral vascular limitations may similarly benefit from EPR imaging of redox status. These
physiologic parameters can be measured using nitroxide radicals, which are optimally detected with rapid scan
EPR. Pulsed EPR measurement of local oxygen concentration with trityl radicals can guide radiation treatment
of tumors in mice. The proposed system will include both of these powerful techniques. Experienced
collaborators will test the imager in applications to redox equilibria in mouse tumors, reactive oxygen species
related to cancer in mice, and acute lung injury.
 Space is at a premium in medical facilities, and in industry floor space for a new modality is expensive.
Looking toward expanded use in the pharmaceutical industry the 1 GHz imager will be compact and
transportable. Smaller, faster, more versatile imaging will enhance applications of oximetric imaging to tumor
therapy and to the other pathologies listed above. The prototype with technology for both rapid scan
spectroscopy and oximetric imaging will open new vistas for quantifying more physiologic parameters than
oximetry alone. The integrated software system will enable use by technicians without advanced training in the
underlying spectroscopy.
 The industrial partner, Bruker BioSpin, and University of Denver’s engineers will design a new
generation of 1 GHz cross-loop and surface coil resonators, a small magnet and scan coils. Bruker contributes
supplemental (optional) support beyond the grant budget with engineering team commitments to work on
commercializing our rapid scan EPR method and components. Bruker brings to the team essential experience
and know-how of commercial standards, manufacturability, long-term support, and customer needs. Lack of
the proposed capability has stymied the expansion of EPR capabilities into more general biomedical research
use. The innovation is the creation of a prototype that our team’s industrial component can refine into a
marketable product with powerful EPR capability for end users."

The main objective of our T32 Training Program is to train MD and PhD post-doctoral fellows in research focused
on Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (NDDs). This program, the District of Columbia NDD T32, is associated with
and fully integrated into our District of Columbia Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center
(DC-IDDRC). The rationale for this program is as follows: 1) Neurodevelopmental disabilities affect a significant
percentage of the US population, and 10% of households live with an individual with an NDD, therefore these
conditions represent a substantial financial and emotional burden in our society; 2) The biological causes of
NDDs range from genetic to acquired insults, requiring an interdisciplinary neuroscience approach to define
underlying causes and mechanisms of disease; and 3) There is significant overlap of symptoms amongst the
various neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting overlapping mechanisms. Our trainees and mentors use
cutting-edge techniques, including genetic, cellular/molecular, physiological, functional/behavioral, and
structural/dynamic imaging to engage in basic and translational NDD research projects. Multidisciplinary training
is emphasized, based on the variety of training opportunities and core facilities available at the participating
institutions. Children’s National Hospital (CNH) is particularly well positioned to lead this program, based on: 1)
Strengths in basic, translational and clinical research, and in mentorship in all the proposed areas of NDD
research; 2) Substantial institutional resources for research and training in NDDs; 3) Established, strong
collaborations with all participating institutions; and 4) Its leading role in the DC-IDDRC and in many NIH awards
focusing on conditions causing NDDs. Thirty mentors from CNH, George Washington, Howard and Georgetown
Universities will be involved in the program to help develop and support careers of the trainees, including
submission of a K Award application. We request funding for 3 postdoctoral fellows/year who participate in a 3-
year program. The trainees will obtain: 1) specific and integrated training in NDDs and 2) formal and practical
training in basic and essential skills required for independence, with a focus on research methodology, statistics,
and rigor and reproducibility. The training components include a core curriculum consisting of: 1) Subject matter
expertise; 2) Research and quantitative skills, and 3) Communication and writing skills. In addition, trainees will
have customized and experiential components to deepen their training. These include a cross-training rotation
for trainees (e.g., preclinical researchers rotate in the clinic and vice versa); a regular discussion group with a
world-renowned leader and author in the field of NDDs (Mark Batshaw, MD); and we also offer trainees
opportunities to participate in activities that are critical for broadening their perspective on how to conduct
research by interacting with the community they are aiming to help in different venues beyond the lab or clinic,
which will enhance relationships and promote advocacy for the NDD community."
10821454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deaths due to opioid overdose are a pressing public health crisis and the number of deaths per year is
increasing. Rates of fatal overdose are rising faster for Black people than for any other racial/ethnic group,
largely driven by the increased prominence of synthetic opioids. Black people have the highest percentage of
overdose mortality attributable to synthetic opioids and have experienced the greatest increase in related
mortality rates. Interventions are critically needed that can effectively reduce overdose mortality and do so
equitably for Black people. Overdose prevention policies (OPPs) (i.e., Good Samaritan laws and naloxone
access laws), a class of state-level policy interventions intended to reduce overdose mortality, may be able to
address rising racial inequities in fatal overdose. However, there are critical gaps in the literature regarding the
effectiveness of OPPs, including a lack of prior research into which provisions may better reduce overdose
deaths for Black people, and a lack of prior research into the extent to which local contextual factors modify the
effects of state-level OPP provisions. Additionally, the common practice of enacting OPP provisions in
packages creates a significant methodological challenge for standard causal inference approaches of
assessing the effectiveness of individual OPP provisions. The scientific objective of this research plan is to
assess the effectiveness of state-level OPP provisions to equitably reduce overdose mortality and identify
local-level factors that may produce racialized effectiveness of provisions. This project uses novel causal
machine learning methods in conjunction with a combination of restricted mortality data from the National Vital
Statistics System and multiple publicly available data sources to address the methodological challenge and fill
the critical gaps outlined above. This innovative data-driven approach will be complemented by taxonomies of
hypothesized OPP provision effectiveness produced by a panel of opioid policy experts using the Delphi
method. By doing so, this project will empirically evaluate which sets of OPP provisions are most effective at
reducing overdose mortality overall, and specifically among Black people, and estimate the role of local
contextual factors (e.g., access to harm reduction services or local law enforcement practices) in producing
varied effects of OPP provisions. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that
builds upon the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1)
development and implementation of state-level drug policies; (2) measurement and evaluation of policy
intervention effectiveness; and (3) machine learning methods to identify salient causal measures from high-
dimensional data. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant to successfully transition
to an independent research career aimed at using novel statistical and computational methods to identify and
evaluate interventions to reduce racial inequities in substance use related harms."
10756965,"Low back pain (LBP) is the #1 contributor to disability globally and the 4th most prevalent reason for new VA
disability compensation. The societal burden of LBP is largely attributed to 2 distinct subgroups of patients: (1)
those who use healthcare resources for chronic (persistent or recurrent) LBP; and (2) those undergoing
surgical treatments for specific spine-related conditions associated with LBP and/or neuropathic
symptoms/signs, such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LSRS) and symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis
(SLSS). Personalized approaches to improve the efficiency of care and treatment outcomes for these
subgroups of Veterans have the potential to reduce the burden of LBP for the Veteran population. Stratified
care for LBP based on prognosis showed early promise when linked to clinical decisions regarding physical
therapy. More robust effects from stratified care may come through improving the feasibility and prognostic
ability of risk stratification or linking risk stratification to clinical decisions regarding treatments with large
magnitude effects in subgroups of patients with LBP (e.g., decompression surgery for LSRS). The proposed
research will apply these two approaches to improving stratified care for LBP, which will develop and
validate powerful prediction models using clinical electronic health record (EHR) and genomic data.
This research will two parts to achieve each of the two study aims. Part I will involve genome-wide association
study (GWAS) meta-analyses to predict outcomes for LBP-associated conditions, including participants from
the Million Veteran Program (MVP), the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network phase 3
(eMERGE3) network, and the UK Biobank, as well as summary data from other genomic biobanks. Part II will
involve the development and validation of multivariable prognostic models for LBP-related outcomes. First,
multivariable prognostic models will be developed using a cross-validation approach in 80% of the MVP
sample, using only clinical data (visits, diagnoses, pharmacy, vital signs, etc.) from the VA EHR; only
genomic data (genome-wide PRSs); and both clinical and genomic data. Next, the best-performing
multivariable models developed in each aim will be validated in an independent 20% sample of MVP
participants, the eMERGE network phase 3, and UK Biobank. Aim 1. Develop and validate prognostic
models for the risk of chronic LBP with healthcare use (CLBP-HU) in Veterans. These models will identify
Veterans with LBP of substantial impact sufficient to warrant healthcare use, who should be prioritized for
rehabilitative pain treatments. GWAS of CLBP-HU will be conducted. Validated variants will be characterized
and their potential biological roles examined. Multivariable models for predicting CLBP-HU will then be
developed and compared with each other. These models will be informed by (a) EHR-defined clinical data, (b)
genomic data (genome-wide PRSs), and (c) both clinical and genomic data. Hypothesis: prognostic models for
predicting CLBP-HU will have acceptable discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
[AUC] ≥ 0.75). The best-performing models will then be validated in other samples. Aim 2. Develop and
validate prognostic models for the risk of failure of non-operative treatment (surgical decompression)
in two LBP subgroups: (1) Veterans with LSRS and (2) Veterans with SLSS. The same approach will be
followed as used for GWAS and model development in Aim 1. Models developed in Aim 2 will identify Veterans
at high risk for progression to decompression surgery, for whom prolonged rehabilitation (e.g., physical
therapy) is unlikely to be successful. Hypothesis: prognostic models for predicting decompression surgery
using genomic data only will have acceptable discrimination (AUC ≥ 0.75)."
10865090,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is an increasing level of appreciation in the fields of environmental health sciences and toxicology on the
critical role of the gut microbiota on the host response to toxic chemical exposure. The microbiota is known to
directly and indirectly influence the extent of toxicity of dietary and environmental chemicals, and has been
implicated in a wide-range of diseases including metabolic disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Careful
and rigorous experimentation to determine the mechanism by which the microbiota influences environmental
chemical exposure will lead to a more complete understanding of how these chemicals disrupt the host-
microbiota interaction and will generate novel insights into the key signaling pathways underlying those
perturbations and adverse health outcomes. Importantly, studies of the microbiota and environmental chemicals
may provide key insights that will better inform risk assessment that could positively impact human health. In this
R35 RIVER proposal, we plan to work across three innovative and complementary themes to address the
unifying hypothesis that environmental chemical exposure perturbs the host-gut microbiota interaction to
adversely affect health. First, using mouse models, we will explore the idea that early-life exposure to
environmental chemicals impacts later life health outcomes (e.g., metabolic disorders, acute and chronic
inflammatory bowel disorders) via alterations in the host-gut microbiota axis. Second, we will examine how
environmental chemicals impact common commensal microbes of the gastrointestinal tract including their
metabolic activities and potential to modulate host physiology. Third, we will explore new pathways involved in
microbiota control and influence of host physiologic processes. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a
diverse, collaborative, and highly interdisciplinary team consisting of experts in biochemistry, enzymology,
immunology, metabolism, microbiology, transcriptional regulation, and toxicology. The Patterson lab has a long
history of making unique and seminal discoveries along the host-gut microbiota axis and thus is well-positioned
with cutting-edge technology and approaches, experience, innovative ideas, and an open/collaborative
environment to advance our understanding of the host-gut microbiota interaction and help to move the field
forward. From a translational standpoint, these studies may lead to new protective approaches toward dietary
and environmental toxicity through design of new pre/probiotics."
10894306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since its inception nearly five decades ago, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has continued to evolve and is
far from having reached its ultimate potential. MRI is unquestionably the most complex but also the richest and
most versatile imaging method, therefore requiring systematic training. Although inherently quantitative, MRI has
been used largely as a qualitative imaging technique practiced by radiologists utilizing predominantly qualitative
criteria for establishing a diagnosis or excluding disease. This approach is fraught with problems, its main limi-
tation being the subjective nature of the result, i.e. sensitivity to reader experience and judgment. An increasing
number of problems in medicine require a quantitative assessment of tissue structure, physiology and function.
Moreover, for many diagnostic or staging problems quantification of an observation is not merely a better option
but the qualitative approach is entirely unsuited. Examples are measurement of blood flow and perfusion, quan-
tification of metabolite concentration by spectroscopic imaging and chemical exchange saturation transfer
(CEST), the assessment of non-focal systemic disorders such as degenerative neurologic or metabolic bone
disease where a quantitative measurement of some structural or functional parameter has to be made. Over the
years the modality has become ever more complex with the ongoing emergence of new methodologies, providing
increasingly detailed insight into tissue function and metabolism. Recent years saw the development and inte-
gration of advanced machine learning approaches for a variety of tasks including segmentation and computer
assisted diagnosis. Successful participation in these developments demands in-depth, modality-specific training
to enable future scientists to effectively deploy the myriad of mathematical tools for pulse sequence design and
data reconstruction. Translation of new methods from the bench to the clinic is equally important and highlighted
as one of NIH’s key priorities. The training process therefore needs to be multidisciplinary, requiring close coop-
eration among MR physicists, engineers, computer scientists and physicians in the various subspecialties. Basic
science trainees often understand the medical problem incompletely and typically have difficulties in translating
abstract technical concepts to the practicing physician. The proposed training program builds on the director’s
earlier program and its record in terms of achieved training outcome, showing the large majority of former train-
ees having attained academic faculty or senior research positions in industry. The new program builds on this
successful formula by proposing to train four predoctoral candidates in MRI physics and engineering, with par-
ticular focus on structural, physiologic and functional applications, for a period of two years. Training modalities
involve a combination of colloquia, structured teaching and hands-on laboratory training, and emphasis on pre-
ceptor-directed research. The training faculty covers a broad spectrum of expertise in multidisciplinary research
training as well as basic and translational research excellence."
10854783,"Project Background/Rationale. The great majority of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop speech
impairments (Ho et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2007; Schalling et al., 2017), most of which are grouped together
and called hypokinetic dysarthria. Hypokinetic dysarthria is typically characterized by altered prosody (e.g.,
reduced loudness and pitch variation), phonation (e.g., breathy or harsh voice), and articulation (e.g., imprecise
consonants, centralized vowels) (Fox & Ramig, 1997; Ho et al., 1999; Hillenbrand & Houde, 1996). Changes
in speech may appear early in PD (Miller et al., 2008; Rusz et al., 2011; Skodda et al., 2013) and progress in
severity over time (Skodda et al., 2013; Skodda et al., 2009; Skodda, Flasskamp et al., 2011). Further, such
changes in speech lead to significant declines in functional communication and quality of life (Miller et al., 2006
& 2007). Pharmacological and surgical interventions that alleviate motor symptoms in PD are largely ineffective
or sometimes even detrimental for speech.
Project Objectives. Based on results from our recently completed VA SPiRE project, we propose to conduct a
pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in patients with hypokinetic dysarthria in PD to assess the potential
effectiveness of a novel home-based exercise intervention with interactive automated speech response
features that encourage a higher level of speech performance. We hypothesize that patients in the intervention
program will improve in speech intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability over 6 months, as
compared with patients in a health education program.
Project Methods. A total of 104 community-dwelling veterans with hypokinetic dysarthria in mild-to-moderate
PD will be randomized to the exercise intervention or to the health education control. We will test the effects of
the intervention at 6 months for the outcomes speech intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability."
10932849,"Sensory-based rehabilitation facilitates functional improvements after spinal cord injury (SCI) in animals and humans. Clinical programs for human patients utilize combinatorial Forced Exercise (FE) and Non-Forced Exercise (NFE) training programs to facilitate functional improvements (think treadmill vs. walking on a track). For FE, it is believed that incoming environmental cues work locally on the spinal level to mitigate functional deficits. While NFE, which enables for trial and error, introduces motor variability into the neural system. Variability helps fine tune descending brain commands to improve motor performance. However, key questions remain: How do different training paradigms change spinal cord circuits and contribute to motor recovery? Answers will help to fine tune these sensory-rehabilitation strategies to optimize functional recovery. The hypothesis of this proposal is that FE and NFE initiate distinct neural rewiring strategies and characterizable differences in functional recovery following SCI. I will use mouse genetic strategies to illuminate anatomical changes in rewiring. Specifically, I will examine the changes in neural circuitry of a premotor network, Deep Dorsal horn spinal cord ParvalBumin+ neurons (dPVs). dPVs receive convergent touch, proprioceptive, and supraspinal information, and are differentially engaged during task-dependent motor behaviors. Changes in inputs onto or outputs from dPVs therefore reflect the contributions of paradoxical training (FE/NFE) in mediating recovery. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that FE will evoke elevated sensory neural rewiring, while NFE will result in increased descending brain inputs. I will couple genetic approaches with quantitative synaptic analysis to anatomically map corticospinal and touch/proprioceptive inputs onto dPVs. Aim 1’s training potential lies in learning mouse genetics, high resolution quantitative synaptic analysis, and to further hone my biostatistics training. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that NFE facilitates smooth naturalistic motor movements and behavioral state maps more closely related to the preinjury condition than FE. I will couple muscle activity recordings with highly sensitive computer vision/machine learning to investigate the influence of training (1) granularly on muscle responses (EMGs) and joint activity and (2) holistically on naturalistic behavior. I will also characterize dPVs outputs onto motor neurons using genetic approaches and label affected motor neurons innervating leg muscles with implanted electrodes. Aim 2’s training potential is rooted in cutting-edge computational techniques, muscle recordings, and data interpretation. The collective results will provide an understanding of the (1) supraspinal and sensory integration and evoked motor responses involved in NFE and (2) functional benefits of NFE in complex motor behaviors. My research will break down current barriers of translational preclinical research to help instruct clinical rehabilitation. The high training potential for these Aims has been carefully designed to fill my gap-based knowledge. The impact of this fellowship will foster my successful, impactful, and enduring independent research career in the field of SCI."

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at Chapman University, and adjunct Assistant Professor at City of Hope
(COH) Comprehensive Cancer Center. I have expertise in health disparities, community engagement, and
community-based participatory research including advocacy; cancer and cancer health disparities; cancer
survivorship and clinic-based interventions. However, I have not developed, implemented, or analyzed a
multi-level community-based intervention for Black breast cancer survivors. Black women face disparities
in all stages of the cancer continuum and their survivorship needs remain unmet. Current research on endocrine
disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in hair products indicate an increased risk and recurrence of breast cancer for Black
women. There is also a dearth of psychosocial interventions that address the unique needs of Black breast
cancer survivors. Behavioral interventions for this population lack content on identity, hair care, and harmful
environmental exposures. Interventions are urgently needed for Black breast cancer survivors to address their
unique survivorship journeys and reduce harmful environmental exposures during survivorship. My goals are to
develop, implement and disseminate community-based interventions that improve quality of life (QOL) and
address health behaviors related to Black identity that contribute to disparities affecting cancer risk and
survivorship. As a first step towards these broad goals, with this K01 proposal, I seek to develop and evaluate
an intervention to improve QOL and reduce adverse chemical exposures of EDCs found in personal care
products of Black breast cancer survivors, post-treatment. The proposed career development and training plan
support my trajectory toward becoming an independent, community-based implementation scientist with a focus
on cancer health disparities through training and experience in 1) Designing community-based multi-level
interventions; 2) Assessing environmental exposures in a community-based multi-level intervention; and
3) Using implementation science to evaluate community-based interventions for Black women. This
project will take place at Chapman University with mentors who are experts in training and mentoring K01
trainees and assessing the psychological, biological and social influences on women’s health outcomes
(Primary: Laura Glynn, PhD, Chapman University); randomized intervention designs (Co-Mentor: Virginia Sun,
PhD, RN, COH); clinical implications of intervention design for Black breast cancer survivors (Co-Mentor: Abenaa

10885094,"Abstract:
Exercise and mindfulness are believed to be effective stress reduction interventions, but research to date has
not been able to assess their benefits while individuals are coping with a major stressor in real time. The
COVID-19 pandemic is an unwanted natural experiment in the deleterious effects of stress – especially social
isolation (social disconnectedness and loneliness), a stressor particularly strongly associated with the
pandemic - on older Americans’ cognitive and emotional health and risk for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This
project will elucidate whether exercise and mindfulness can mitigate the effects of pandemic stress on
cognitive function and emotional health in later life, including neurobiological measures of risk for AD.
We will leverage a unique resource: the NIH-funded trial, “Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Exercise
for Age-Related Cognitive Decline” (MEDEX). By leveraging MEDEX and following these participants, who
continue to attend monthly booster sessions of their randomized condition remotely during the pandemic, we
will have repeated sets of clinical, cognitive, molecular, and neuroimaging measures covering 7.5 years during
the pre-, during-, and post-pandemic period. We can examine intervention effects, as well as individual factors
such as resilience, on long-term outcomes. Among other innovative aspects of the project, we will analyze
effects on two novel peripheral biomarkers: Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which
measures mechanisms of biological aging, and plasma amyloid Aβ42 and Aβ40, which measure AD risk.
In the proposed project, (1) during the pandemic, we will use novel methods such as Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) to characterize social isolation both objectively (e.g., number of social contacts) and
subjectively (e.g., loneliness), and its biological mechanisms on aging (such as elevations in SASP and plasma
amyloid); (2) post-pandemic, we will assess downstream effects on cognitive function, emotional well-being,
and brain health, including AD risk, using neuropsychological assessments, EMA, and neuroimaging.
Outcomes include (Aim 1) changes in cognitive performance and emotional well-being, and decline in
emotional well-being measured by positive and negative affect and sleep quality; increases in biological aging
and decreasing AΒ42/40 ratio in the post-pandemic phase, indicating higher risk of AD; atrophy in hippocampal
and prefrontal volume (structural MRI) and reduced global functional connectivity (resting-state fMRI).
Modifiers of these effects (Aim 2) include exercise and mindfulness; psychological resilience; COVID-19
exposure; medical morbidities; and APOE genotype. Mechanisms of cognitive, emotional, and brain health
changes (Aim 3) include amyloid (Aβ40 and Aβ42), SASP, DNA methylation, and cortisol during the pandemic.
This project will advance our knowledge of the impact of social isolation and other stressors on older adults,
including mechanisms by which these stressors produce deleterious cognitive, emotional, and brain health
changes over time, and whether exercise and mindfulness have durable protective effects."

10874619,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Conjunctivitis impacts approximately 6 million people annually in the United States, accounting for 1%
of all primary care office visits, and costing 430 million USD annually. Viruses are responsible for ~80%
of conjunctivitis cases, and human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are implicated in up to 65% of these. A
particularly severe cause of conjunctivitis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is caused principally by
viruses within human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), for example the highly virulent adenovirus type
37 (HAdV-D37). The clinical manifestations of EKC include severe membranous conjunctivitis and
epithelial keratitis, followed by delayed onset of multifocal subepithelial (stromal) corneal infiltrates. The
latter cause light sensitivity and reduced vision, and can persist or recur for months to years after the
acute infection, long after the virus is gone. We have shown in work published over the last 20+ years
that adenovirus binding to human corneal cells activates complex intracellular signaling events that
control subsequent cellular entry, intracellular trafficking of virions for delivery of viral DNA into cell
nuclei, virion assembly and viral replication, and proinflammatory gene expression by infected cells. In
this application, we extend our studies with new revelations on viral trafficking, new functions for a viral
structural protein, and new evidence for expression of a novel proinflammatory mediator by infected
corneal epithelial cells. The specific aims of this proposal are to test the hypotheses that 1) kinesin-1
and V-ATPase play previously unidentified roles in adenovirus trafficking, 2) adenoviral minor coat
protein IIIa promotes adenovirus replication, and 3) corneal epithelial cell HMGB1 promotes
inflammation in adenovirus keratitis. We will apply proteomic, siRNA, and imaging approaches to
determine final stages of virion uncoating in human corneal epithelial cells and human corneal
fibroblasts. A role for viral protein IIIa in nuclear transport of viral proteins for virion assembly will be
determined by use of deletion and point mutants of pIIIa through surface plasmon resonance, imaging,
PCR, and proteomics experiments. Finally, we will determine a role for human corneal epithelial cell
expression of the multi-potent molecule HMGB1 in the formation of subepithelial infiltrates in EKC.
These studies are designed to move us toward a more detailed understanding of adenoviral corneal
pathogenesis, in order to reach our goal of an information-based therapy to mitigate the morbidity of
adenovirus ocular infections."
10843155,"Project Summary
Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of
basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy.
Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be
targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen
research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which
neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important
during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient
response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of
neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field.
Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very
limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can
elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of
neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of
neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with
advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations.
Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of
all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have
focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy
administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of
neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this
important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality
features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response.
Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen
data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction
of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly
share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations.
Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform
neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms
of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and
also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, affecting nearly half of all adults in the
United States and responsible for a quarter of all deaths each year, with rates continuing to rise. The
microbiome offers a unique paradigm for investigating and eventually mitigating the global burden of CVD.
Aided by high-throughput sequencing technology, microbiome profiling studies have found bacterial
communities to be related to CVD risk factors, including hypertension and systolic blood pressure. This
knowledge is invaluable both from the perspective of better understanding etiology and from the perspective of
therapeutic development, as the microbiome is inherently modifiable. However, although many studies have
demonstrated possible relationships, the specific bacterial taxa associated with CVD risk factors, as well as the
manner in which they are related, are poorly understood. Recently, large scale microbiome profiling studies of
hundreds to thousands of individuals have been conducted within existing, on-going cohort studies. These
studies offer a unique opportunity to achieve more thorough investigation of the impact of microbiomes on CVD
risk factors. Unfortunately, the statistical and computational approaches for analyzing these studies are
lacking. This proposal aims to fill critical gaps in the methodological literature by addressing four major areas.
Specifically, we aim to develop comprehensive suite of statistical tools for (1) addressing batch effects in
microbiome studies – increasingly problematic as studies get bigger; (2) improved identification of individual
taxa associated with CVD risk factors; (3) conducting mediation analysis and understanding the relative role of
microbiota and exposures on risk factors; and (4) assessing the role of the microbiota as an effect modifier.
These approaches are all based on rigorous prior data emphasizing the importance of the problems as well as
the limitations or absence of existing strategies. Our work is motivated by and will directly enable analyses in
three of the largest, and richest microbiome profiling studies around: few studies have the combination of
sample size and richness of covariates as the CARDIA, MEC, and SOL microbiome studies. Consequently, our
methods have the potential for accelerating understanding of the role of microbes in CVD and facilitate
development of therapies and strategies for stemming the rising CVD epidemic."
10656323,"Tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a major public
health concern in the United States. Identifying and treating individuals with latent TB is a key strategy to
achieve the goal of TB elimination in the US but there are many challenges to achieving this goal. In
Baltimore, where this research will be conducted, more than one-third of non-US-Born individuals have latent
TB, and they are disproportionately affected by co-morbidities that increase the risk of progression to active
TB, such as diabetes and HIV. However, socioeconomic factors such as poverty, access to care, health
literacy, and language or cultural barriers present obstacles to treatment. Treatment for an asymptomatic
condition, such as latent TB, is rarely a priority for patients with many other competing needs. The length of
treatment (several months for standard “short-course” regimens) is also problematic, particularly for patients
experiencing housing or financial instability. Therefore, the majority of individuals infected with latent TB do not
complete treatment. We propose to evaluate novel and scalable smartphone enabled interventions to promote
completion of treatment for latent TB. Video-directly observed therapy (vDOT) provides multi-faceted
adherence support by allowing real-time monitoring of adherence coupled with case-management feedback, is
available in patient's preferred languages, and delivers electronic reminders. Likewise, behavior economic
(financial) incentives, in which patients receive incentives contingent on ingesting prescribed medications,
could mitigate financial stress associated with medical care and lost wages, a common concern among many
patients with latent TB infection. Adults with latent TB (N=399) will be randomized to a Usual Care Control, or
vDOT, or a vDOT Plus Incentives group. Usual Care Control participants will receive standard care for latent
TB. VDOT participants will receive the same Usual Care, but will use smartphones and a commercially
available application to receive electronic reminders, submit video-observations to document adherence, and
receive case-management real-time feedback. VDOT plus Incentives participants will receive further support
through contingent financial incentives (up to $35 per week) for taking prescribed medications under the vDOT
system. The primary outcome measure, completion of treatment for latent TB, will be assessed for all
participants through MEMS caps (Aim 1). We will also determine the costs, budgetary impact, and
incremental cost-effectiveness of the vDOT and vDOT plus incentives interventions (Aim 2). If this intervention
is effective in promoting completion of treatment for latent TB and is economically sound, it could prove to be a
scalable and effective intervention to promote completion of treatment for latent TB in high-risk populations in
Baltimore and in other populations around the world."

 Our global objective is to develop a molecular understanding of how during development a population of stem
cells (SCs) are set aside to produce, maintain and regenerate our tissues. As our longstanding AR27883
research on skin has shown, our basic science approach has led to advances in regenerative medicine and our
understanding of human syndromes. Our skin epidermis is our body's barrier to the outside world: it must keep
harmful microbes out and retain essential body fluids. Our current research centers on how emerging tissue SCs
sense and interact with their surroundings (cells, signals and mechanical forces) not only to achieve a balance
of proliferation and differentiation, but also to eliminate underperforming tissue cells as they arise. Understanding
how healthy epidermal SCs arise and how they perform their duties is prerequisite to unraveling how cellular
organization goes awry in inflammatory disorders and cancers of the skin.
 During skin development, stratified epidermis (and its hair follicle appendages) forms from a single layer of
unspecified progenitors. As morphogenesis proceeds, resident epidermal SCs are set aside so that in adult skin,
these self-renewing progenitors maintain and repair the skin's barrier. To what extent do self and non-self
epidermal SC neighbors, and the mechanical forces they generate, participate in regulating SC behavior during
normal homeostasis? What is the molecular nature of this communication circuitry that balances epidermal
growth and differentiation? In the next 5 years, we'll: (1). Spatially map the temporal dynamics of cells and their
transcriptomes as embryonic skin progenitors interact with newly emerging self and/or non-self neighbors, which
together shape the niches that allow progenitors to behave as mature SCs with defined tasks. (2). Identify key
signaling inputs that orchestrate the continual flux of epidermal progenitors and differentiating progeny that
maintains and rejuvenates the body's barrier. (3). Elucidate how epidermis eliminates poorly performing cells for
the sake of tissue fitness. (4). Elucidate how key signaling pathways and transcriptional events drive different
regional mechanical forces during skin development and contribute to distinct morphologies and tissue functions.
We'll apply the knowledge gained to determine how deviations in stem cell crosstalk with neighbors (`niche') lead
to disease. To meet our aims, we and our collaborators developed unprecedented tools to a) spatiotemporally
landscape gene expression across the skin, b) interrogate how mechanical forces impact tissue biology and c)
track and characterize SCs as they sense and eliminate aberrant neighbors to preserve tissue fitness.
 While promising for regenerative medicine, adult tissue stem cells are long-lived and can also accumulate
mutations that compromise tissue fitness and enhance cancer susceptibility. By unraveling how healthy SCs
eliminate aberrantly performing cells, and yet over time, allow phenotypically silent oncogenic clonal diversity to
accumulate, we aim to advance therapeutics to halt cancers before they appear. Our work on how mechanical
forces impact SC behavior will be equally key in understanding how aggressive cancers arise."

 The incidence of cardiac arrest in the United States exceeds 300,000 per year with an average survival rate
of ~11%. Over 500,000 cardiac surgeries and procedures, which require detailed cardiac diagnostics and
intense monitoring, are performed to treat arrhythmias and structural heart disease in the US each year, which
together carry a morbidity and mortality risk of 1-30%, depending on a patient’s comorbidities. The
fundamental hypothesis underlying this proposal is: Progression of arrhythmogenesis reflects heterogeneities
in cardiac electrical substrate that are amplified by heterogeneities in autonomic control. As such,
interventions that mitigate autonomic heterogeneities should be (and are) anti-arrhythmic. A major unmet
need in the field of Neurocardiology is technologies that provide real-time predictive assessments of cardiac
and autonomic status that would then allow for rapid and targeted closed-loop neuromodulation therapies to
intervene in the progression of arrhythmogenesis. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop bioelectronic
technologies for high-resolution, real-time concurrent measurements of cardiac autonomic and
electrophysiological parameters and to use that information to modulate autonomic function in a feedback
control manner. Advances in analytics for data derived from intra-myocardial multi-pole electrodes, coupled
with the deployment of thin-film 2-D microarrays to the epicardium, will define electrical heterogeneities across
the border zone areas of the ischemic heart. Autonomic assessment will include real-time measurement of
regional cardiac neurotransmitter release profiles, leveraging electrochemical cyclic voltammetry
(catecholamine) and capacitive immunoprobe (neuropeptide measurements), each novel to the cardiac
setting. The ability to provide real-time readouts of vascular and cardiac neurochemicals, when combined
with our advances in direct epicardial and endocardial mapping of the cardiac electrical substrate, provides
our team the ability to 1) identify subjects at high risk for sudden cardiac death; 2) define specific contribution
of abnormal electrophysiological substrate as amplified by heterogeneities in autonomic neurotransmitters;
and 3) tailor closed-loop neuromodulation therapeutic interventions to the underlying pathology. To this end,
three aims are proposed. Aim 1: To develop bioelectronic interfaces, platforms/modules, and analytical tools
for real-time in vivo assessments of multiple cardiac interstitial and vascular neurotransmitter levels. Aim 2:
To define dynamic interactions between focal cardiac neurotransmitter release and modulation of regional
cardiac electrical function in reflex response to cardiac stress. Aim 3: To implement a Multi Input, Multi Output
(MIMO) closed-loop control of cardiac transmitters. The translational potential of such a closed-loop
neuromodulation system will find application in intraoperative, post-operative and critical care settings."

The goal of this project is to establish the role of CCL28 in chronic pancreatitis and use structure-based drug discovery methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of this secreted protein. CCL28 is a mucosal chemokine that promotes tumor growth in a variety of organs by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express the G protein-coupled receptor CCR10. Based on our published and preliminary results, we postulate that secretion of the chemokine CCL28 by pancreatic ductal epithelial cells also drives chronic inflammation that progresses to malignant disease. We hypothesize that inhibition of CCL28 activity will alter the pancreatic mucosal microenvironment in a manner that reduces pre-malignant inflammation and enhances the activity of existing chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies. To achieve this objective, we propose three conceptually linked but experimentally independent specific aims. First, we will test our mechanistic hypothesis in animal models of chronic pancreatitis, to demonstrate experimentally that CCL28 activity through CCR10 plays a key role in the fibroinflammatory response in vivo and develop an in vitro model that can be used to screen promising inhibitors (aim 1). Key elements of CCL28 recognition by its G protein-coupled receptor CCR10 will be mapped in detail using NMR and molecular modeling, and we will define the complete intracellular signaling profile of this chemokine receptor using state-of-the-art assay platforms for receptor pharmacology (aim 2). Using the solved NMR structure of CCL28 and knowledge of its sulfotyrosine binding pocket, we will employ a structure-based strategy developed in the Volkman lab that enables the discovery of small molecules that bind a specific chemokine target and inhibit cell migration (aim 3). Collectively, the proposed studies will provide fundamental advances in our understanding of (1) Treg function and pathophysiology in the pancreas, (2) the structural basis for ligand-receptor selectivity and GPCR pharmacology in a largely unexamined chemokine signaling axis, and (3) the druggability of a mucosal chemokine at the tumor-promoting interface of chronic inflammation and neoplasia."
10841046,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The goal of this proposal is to develop statistical methods for evaluating treatment strategies at different
time points and identifying optimal treatment strategies on the basis of patients' longitudinal biomarker
measurements. It is motivated by our research on identifying the best timing for patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) to receive a stem cell transplant (SCT). SCT can cure leukemia, but it is associated with life-
threatening risks. For this reason, most patients start with other less-aggressive treatment options that are
much safer but cannot cure the disease. Thus the decision-making about optimal timing of SCT depends on a
patient's disease progression. However, it is infeasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to weigh the
risks and benefits of SCT at various times. To optimize this decision-making process, sophisticated and
comprehensive statistical models are needed to provide an accurate estimation of the benefits and risks (and
their trade-offs) over time for patients under different SCT timing options. However, these have not yet been
developed, due to the challenges elaborated below.
 First, the question of an optimal decision on SCT cannot be answered by a single statistical model, it
requires assembling information from a series of models and analyses. Second, there most likely is not a
uniform solution for this question, as the optimal timing of SCT depends on each individual's disease
progression status. Consequently, physicians must use patients' longitudinal biomarker trajectories to monitor
their health status and make treatment decision in a dynamic fashion. Third, the treatment decision for each
individual must account for their competing risks, including death by treatment-related complications and other
causes (e.g., heart diseases and diabetes). Finally, it is impossible to implement optimal decision-making
without an easy-to-use software. The following specific aims are proposed to solve these problems.
Aim 1: Use functional component principal component analysis (FPCA) techniques to fully capture the
 dominant patterns from patients' longitudinal biomarker trajectories, and use them as predictors of
 patients’ risk of disease progression.
Aim 2: Estimate dynamic competing risks based on baseline covariates and longitudinal biomarker
 trajectories using multi-state models.
Aim 3: Use analytic and microsimulation approaches to estimate and compare the mean survival times
 under different SCT timing options.
Aim 4: Conduct validation studies, develop software, and broaden application.
 Three CML studies will be used to cross-validate each other regarding the optimal timing of SCT. Software
programs with user-friendly interfaces will be made publicly available. The proposed statistical and software
programs will be adapted and applied to a study of kidney disease to test their broad application."
10804681,"Abstract
Approximately one third of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harbor an internal
tandem duplication in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD), which is clinically associated with an increased rate of
relapse in response to standard therapies. As a result, targeted small molecules such as quizartinib, a
type 2 FLT3 inhibitor that induces differentiation of AML cells, have garnered attention as a means by
which relapsed FLT3-ITD+ AML can be effectively treated. Unfortunately, the median duration response
of these patients to quizartinib was found to be 12.1 weeks due to the acquisition of secondary mutations
at the D835 locus in the FLT3 gene. A second type 1 inhibitor of FLT3-ITD, midostaurin, was developed
by Novartis, which, as a single agent failed to induce complete remission (CR) and when bone marrow
was analyzed, there was no significant difference seen between the midostaurin-treated and placebo
groups. However, in combination with chemotherapy, the CR rate was 59% compared to 54% CR
induced by chemotherapy alone. Midostaurin, in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine,
decreased the risk of AML-related death by 22% compared with placebo and was approved by the FDA
for the treatment of AML. To explain the lack of efficacy of midostaurin as a single agent, it has been
proposed that AML cells often overexpress SRC family kinases and their elevated expression may
provide a survival advantage. This theory was further supported by studies which showed that
combination of midostaurin and dasatinib (a SRC inhibitor) were more effective in killing FLT3-ITD+
cell lines (in vitro) than single agent therapy. These observations suggest that there is a need to develop
additional FLT3 inhibitors which can induce complete remission in AML patients harboring mutant
FLT3. To address this medical need, we developed a compound that inhibits both FLT3 and SRC family
kinases (150030). 150030 is a Type I inhibitor that inhibits the FLT3-ITD as well as the D835 mutant forms.
Cell viability assays showed that 150030 induced apoptosis of FLT3-mutant AML cells while sparing
AMLs with WT-FLT3. 150030 is orally bioavailable, exhibited excellent pharmacological profile and
induced complete regression of tumors in nude mouse xenograft assays. The studies proposed are aimed
at further evaluating the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of 150030 in an effort to advance
this compound to clinical trials. The aims are: (1) To compare the effects of midostaurin and 150030 on
the growth and differentiation of murine myeloid cell line, 32Dcl3, co-expressing FLT3-ITD and SRC
family kinases and determine the effects of these two compounds on leukemia progression in syngeneic
animal models; (2) To compare the efficacy of 150030 and midostaurin in clinically relevant PDX models
of AML to develop protocols for a single agent and combination therapy; and (3) To determine the
resistance mechanisms associated with 150030."

NHANES data indicate that 47.3% of Americans have high blood pressure (hypertension), 71.3% are overweight,
and there is strong overlap between these groups. Hypothalamic pathways controlling blood pressure are tightly
intertwined with pathways controlling resting metabolic rate (RMR). With prolonged obesity, cardiovascular-
stimulating autonomic responses and blood pressure responses remain intact, but RMR control progressively
desensitizes (a process termed “RMR adaptation”). RMR adaptation is thought to contribute to the resistance of
the body to maintaining weight loss, and the propensity of the body to regain mass. Thus, there is a critically
unmet need to understand the basic hypothalamic neurocircuitry that coordinately controls blood pressure and
RMR in healthy conditions, and how this system selectively desensitizes during obesity. The renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) within the brain is well known to contribute to blood pressure control through actions in multiple
brain regions, and our team recently discovered that the RAS within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
(ARC) is critically involved in the control of RMR. In particular, the angiotensin II (ANG) type 1A receptor (AT1A)
in neurons of the ARC that express Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) are required for control of RMR but not blood
pressure in response to leptin, ANG, and other stimuli. The objective of the current proposal is therefore to clarify
the molecular signaling pathways within AgRP neurons that are utilized by the AT1A receptor to control RMR.
Preliminary data indicate that in the lean state, (i) only a subset of AgRP neurons express AT1A, (ii) these AT1A
signal via a Gi second messenger, and (iii) such signaling causes inhibition of the cell, ultimately to disinhibit
melanocortin signaling in pre-autonomic target regions and thus increase RMR. Excitingly, we have discovered
that following prolonged high fat feeding, a subset of AT1A-expressing AgRP neurons of the ARC spontaneously
exhibit “G protein signal switching” and begin to couple to Gq instead of Gi second-messengers, which results
in stimulatory effects of ANG on these cells. We therefore propose the general hypotheses that (i) in the lean
state, AT1A-expressing AgRP neurons are importantly involved in RMR control, and that AT1A signals via Gi,
but that (ii) after diet-induced obesity, the alteration in AT1A second-messenger cascade from Gi to Gs in these
cells is causal for the development of RMR adaptation. Aim 1 will define the ‘normal’ signaling cascade of AT1A
in AgRP neurons in lean animals, while Aim 2 will dissect the mechanistic contribution of G protein signal
switching in these cells in the development of RMR adaptation. These studies will utilize an array of novel
transgenic animal models, viral delivery methods, cutting-edge cardiometabolic phenotyping approaches, and
chemogenetic methods. Completion of the project will greatly increase fundamental understanding of RMR
control and adaptation biology, and provide the first in vivo evaluation of the pathophysiological significance of
G protein signal switching downstream of ANG receptors in a single cell type in cardiometabolic physiology."

Transforming the environment to embrace inclusive excellence at an institution as large as the University of
Michigan (UM) requires innovative, evidence-based strategies. UM is well positioned to implement a program
to improve the success rates of underrepresented and/or minoritized (URM) scientists in securing faculty
positions and persisting in them, including via intentional hiring practices, rigorous programming and
strengthening mentoring networks and research support communities. The Michigan Program for Advancing
Cultural Transformation (M-PACT) will proactively implement scientifically informed interventions to support
careers of a talented, highly competitive and diverse group of M-PACT Scholars in the biomedical and health
sciences. These interventions will focus directly on Scholar development, as well as on the institutional actors
with whom Scholars interact and the academic environments in which Scholars operate to ensure impact
beyond the Scholars themselves. Specific Aims 1 and 2 focus on creating and cultivating high quality, culturally
engaged mentoring relationships, deep mentoring networks and supportive communities of practice. M-PACT
will provide intensive training around culturally engaged mentoring approaches to all program Sponsor-
Mentors, improving Scholars' and other faculty members' equitable access to high quality mentoring
relationships. M-PACT also will create topically focused subgroups, or research clusters, comprised of M-
PACT Scholars across schools/colleges, with clusters that span the spectrum of translational health research,
focused on: 1) Basic Biomedical Research; 2) Clinical-Translational Research; and 3) Social and Behavioral
Research. Led by expert faculty with strong records of mentoring URM early-career scientists, the clusters will
function as supportive and intellectually rigorous communities of practice, broadening and deepening Scholars'
mentoring networks of senior scientists and near-peer mentors and providing training, resources and other
professional development opportunities tailored to Scholars' specific research foci and disciplines/fields. Aim 3
focuses on career development around foundational skills relevant to Scholar productivity, success and
retention. A key focus will be to enhance M-PACT Scholars' preparedness and competitiveness for NIH R01
grants, addressing documented racial and gender disparities in access to external funding. Moreover, M-PACT
will support Scholars' skills and leadership for advancing DEI in the biomedical and health sciences in ways
matched to their career stage. Aim 4 emphasizes how M-PACT will support cultural transformation, including
and beyond the positive program impacts on the M-PACT Scholars, by 1) building institutional capacity and
buy-in through creating forums for sharing, exchange and action-planning with institutional and department
leaders and faculty around the use of evidence-based practices for improving mentoring and
campus/departmental climate; 2) creating communities and structures that promote belonging, skill-building
and productivity; and 3) increasing the persistence, success and retention of URM scientists."
10866581,"PROJECT SUMMARY: EVALUATION CORE
The Evaluation Core (EC) will lead assessment of the Michigan Program for Advancing Cultural
Transformation (M-PACT) at the University of Michigan (UM). The EC will employ quantitative and qualitative
analyses to evaluate how a cohort and cluster design model of faculty hiring, development and sponsorship,
which intentionally targets challenges that disproportionately affect underrepresented and/or minoritized (URM)
groups, can not only improve the career experiences and outcomes of the promising biomedical and health
science researchers in that cohort, but transform broader institutional culture to support diversity, equity and
inclusion (DEI). To evaluate the program's impact on participating Scholars' careers and institutional climate,
the EC will collect data from participating Scholars, Sponsor-Mentors, Cluster Leads, Unit Mentors, Unit
Leaders, and other faculty at UM. Mixed-methods analyses will allow for a triangulated understanding of the
impact of the M-PACT program on Scholars and on the institution more broadly, as well as of the underlying
processes associated with such impact. Our evaluation framework incorporates both within-group and
between-group comparisons to elucidate how the program impacts participants via Aim 1, which evaluates
academic success outcomes using administrative data to evaluate productivity and career advancement, and
Aim 2, which evaluates the effects of M-PACT on the barriers and facilitators of career success for M-PACT
Scholars and their perceptions of the program's impact on their careers, using survey and interview data that
will be compared to matched non-M-PACT faculty hired in the same units. Our evaluation framework also
incorporates both within-group and between-group comparisons to elucidate how the program impacts the
wider university community URM faculty via Aim 2, which uses interviews with a broad range of informants,
and via Aim 3, which uses campus-wide DEI surveys about the broader university climate. These efforts are
intended to permit not only a mature ultimate assessment of the program's impact but also to guide its
implementation and inform ongoing process improvement. The team is well positioned to nimbly integrate
insights from these analyses into the design of the program, including the training of Sponsor-Mentors and the
faculty development curriculum. Close communication, facilitated by the integrated administrative structure of
M-PACT, will permit continuous quality improvement to optimize its ultimate impact. The EC team will also
disseminate findings via peer-reviewed publications and meeting presentations, liaise with the NIH FIRST
Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC), and manage data sharing activity to optimize the overall
contributions of the program to the larger field of Biomedical and Health Sciences."

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with dismal outcomes.
There is an unmet need for CMML focused rationally derived therapies. CMML can be divided into
“proliferative” (pCMML) and “dysplastic” subtypes, with pCMML having a high frequency of RAS pathway
mutations and being associated with a median survival of <18 months. We have shown that in pCMML,
mutant NRAS is a bona fide oncogenic driver and that RAS pathway mutations are associated with a unique
gene expression profile enriched in mitotic check point kinases such as PLK1. PLK1 was among the top
protein coding genes upregulated in RAS mutant CMML and given that prior RNAi studies had shown
increased sensitivity of RAS mutant cells to PLK1 inhibition and the fact that PLK1 physically interacts with
RAF1 at the mitotic spindles, as well as the ongoing use of clinical grade PLK1 inhibitors in AML trials, we
selected PLK1 as a therapeutic target in RAS mutant pCMML. We showed differential sensitivity of RAS
mutant pCMML cells to PLK1 inhibition using in vitro (progenitor colony assays) and in vivo models (patient-
derived xenografts) and demonstrated potential synergy with hypomethylating agents (HMA). We now propose
a seminal Phase 1 clinical trial testing the safety and preliminary efficacy of Onvansertib, a novel, oral, PLK1
inhibitor in patients with relapsed/refractory pCMML, using an innovative BOIN (Bayesian Optimal Interval)
design. Samples from trial patients will be used to assess pharmacokinetics, targeting efficacy and response
correlations with PLK1 and KMT2A (regulator of RAS PLK1 axis) expression levels. We will also use our large
CMML biorepository (n=177 RAS mutant samples) to develop in vitro and in vivo models to assess mutational,
transcriptomic and epigenetic predictors of response and resistance; specifically the impact of individual RAS
pathway mutations and cooccurring TET2 and ASXL1 mutations, the two most common response defining
mutations in CMML, on Onvansertib responses. Based on our preliminary data, it is our central hypothesis that
PLK1 inhibition is an effective treatment strategy in RAS mutant pCMML, with responses being influenced by
defined mutational profiles and epigenetic features. We will address this hypothesis by first performing a Phase
1 clinical trial testing the safety and targeting efficacy of Onvansertib, an oral selective PLK1 inhibitor, in
pCMML (AIM 1). Second, we will determine the in vitro impact of individual RAS pathway mutations and
associated CMML transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles on Onvansertib responses (AIM 2). Finally, we will
assess the impact of ASXL1/TET2 mutations on response to Onvansertib and Onvansertib plus HMA in RAS-
pathway mutant CMML xenografts (AIM 3). If successful, this research will provide the first targeted therapy for
RAS mutant myeloid neoplasms, setting the stage for personalized therapeutics in hematological
malignancies."
10819159,"Project Summary
Thrombomodulin (TM) is an integral membrane receptor on endothelial cells which binds to exosite-
1 of thrombin to switch the specificity of thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant protease.
The interaction with TM enables thrombin to activate protein C to activated protein C (APC). In
addition to its anticoagulant function, APC binds to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) to cleave
protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) at Arg46 site to elicit cytoprotective responses in endothelial
cells. The exosite-1-dependent interaction of thrombin with TM on endothelial cells inhibits the
thrombin recognition of PAR1 and procoagulant substrates. TM exerts direct anti-inflammatory
functions through its lectin-like domain by unknown mechanisms. Recent results have indicated an
association between loss of TM expression and uncontrolled cell proliferation and metastasis. Based
on our preliminary data in this application, we hypothesize that the cytoplasmic domain of TM is
linked to the actin cytoskeleton and involved in the regulation of PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling axis.
TM endows a quiescence phenotype to endothelial cells through modulation of this signaling axis
under basal and stimulated conditions. We demonstrate that interaction of EGF-like domains of TM
with exosite-1 of thrombin and proexosite-1 of prothrombin leads to activation (phosphorylation at
Ser172) of AMPK, thereby TM differentially regulating mTORC1 (inhibition) and mTORC2
(activation) signaling. We hypothesize by this signaling mechanism, TM contributes to regulation of
the vascular tone, maintenance, and stabilization of the barrier permeability function of the
vasculature under steady-state and stimulated conditions. We further demonstrate TM changes the
PAR1 cleavage specificity of thrombin from Arg41 site to Arg46 site, thereby switching the PAR1-
dependent signaling specificity of thrombin from a proinflammatory response to a cytoprotective one.
We have prepared a series of TM receptor constructs, recombinant APC and thrombin derivatives
and TM-null and PAR1-null endothelial cells to investigate the following three Specific Aims: Aim 1
will investigate the mechanism by which TM maintains a quiescence phenotype in endothelial cells.
Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic domain of TM is linked to the actin
cytoskeleton and involved in regulation of mTOR signaling upon interaction with ligands thrombin
and prothrombin. Aim 3 will investigate mechanisms through which EPCR and TM modulate the
signaling specificity of PAR1 cleavage by coagulation proteases in endothelial cells."

The emergence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) as dangerous, antibiotic resistant pulmonary
pathogens is outpacing research into their mechanisms of pathogenesis. Our long-term goal is to characterize
NTM in the infection environment and develop new therapeutic approaches aimed at specific in vivo bacterial
activities. The objective of this proposal is to directly assess NTM biofilm formation and growth rate in situ and
determine how the infection environment impacts these processes. We hypothesize that the spatial and
chemical environment of sputum from people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) sputum supports the formation of
antibiotic tolerant, slow-growing NTM biofilms through regulated cellular processes. The rationale for this
proposal is that the biofilm state and growth rate of a specific bacterial pathogen can have drastic influences on
the efficacy of antibiotics and the host immune response. We will test our central hypothesis with two specific
aims: 1) Determine how NTM biofilm formation is regulated by the CF chemical environment and how it
impacts antibiotic tolerance and 2) Determine how anoxia-induced dormancy influences physiological tolerance
and biofilm formation of NTM. The proposed work will combine three innovative complementary techniques
into one coherent strategy for investigating infection-relevant phenotypes such as biofilm formation and
dormancy. We will employ a novel tissue clearing/bacterial visualization technique MiPACT-HCR in both aims.
In Aim 2, we will also utilize a 3D model of the CF infection environment, the Agar Block Biofilm Assay. We will
use a new in vitro aggregation assay that allows us to track and quantify the transition from planktonic cells to
biofilms in both Aims. The proposal is significant because it will provide an accurate description of the
physiological state of NTM during human infection to inform antibiotic choice and dosage decisions. It is also
significant in that it will provide molecular targets for development of anti-biofilm and anti-dormancy strategies
against NTM. The expected outcome of this work is a thorough understanding of the structure and prevalence
of NTM communities during infection of patients with CF and insight into the mechanistic pathways driving
biofilm formation and dormancy. These results will have a positive impact by assisting physicians make more
appropriate treatment choices for NTM infections."

More than 2 million people in the US are exposed to respirable crystalline silica at work. Inhalation
of dust containing respirable crystalline silica causes silicosis, which is characterized by chronic
inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Silica exposure also increases the risk of developing
autoimmune diseases and cancer. Silicosis patients have a median survival of 6 years after
diagnosis. The pathophysiology of silicosis has not been fully understood. Currently, there is no
effective treatment against this devastating disease. It has been reported that the dysregulation
of alveolar macrophages plays an important role in the pathogenesis of silicosis. The deposition
of fine silica particles in alveoli and the ingestion of silica particles by alveolar macrophages trigger
pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses. However, molecular mechanisms of the
dysregulated alveolar macrophage responses remain elusive. Using a mouse model of silicosis,
our preliminary studies indicate that myeloid HDAC6 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis
of silicosis. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that myeloid HDAC6 is a key
mediator of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses in silicosis. We will investigate the
specific role of myeloid HDAC6 in silicosis and evaluate the therapeutic potential of HDAC6 as a
target to treat silicosis."
10817799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The secretory pathway must fold and traffic one third of the proteome, while handling an
exceptional dynamic range of client load. Quality control mechanisms prevent proteostasis in the
secretory pathway from being overwhelmed by proteins in non-native states. One such
mechanism is preemptive quality control (preQC), wherein ER stress inhibits ER translocation of
nascent proteins. This process protects the ER from being overwhelmed with nascent protein
during misfolded protein stress, a situation associated with diverse disease included diabetes and
neurodegenerative diseases. However, this protection leads to secretory protein accumulating in
the cytosol, which can be proteotoxic and lead to cell death and dysfunction. Due to
methodological limitations, the substrates, causes, mechanism, and consequences of preQC are
largely unknown. Hence, the physiological relevance of preQC, while expected to be significant,
is not well understood. We propose to apply our recently developed assay for secretory protein
mistargeting to systematically characterize preQC. We will identify which stresses induce preQC
for a series of protein substrates in secretory cells from diverse human lineages. We will identify
what factors govern triaging of mistargeted secretory proteins between aggregation and
degradation mechanisms. Because our assay is performed in living cells, we will determine which
signaling pathways mediate induction of preQC by ER stress. Finally, we will extend our assay to
allow proteome-wide quantification of both basal and stress-dependent ER mistargeting. This
extension will allow us to identify the factors that govern susceptibility of proteins to preQC. The
outcome of the proposed research will be systematic characterization of how the cell remodels
ER translocation in response to stress."
10760303,"Although largely asymptomatic, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause severe and even fatal disease in a subset of susceptible individuals. While great progress has been made in understanding essential stages of HCMV replication, a detailed description of many of these processes is lacking. Of particular interest in this proposal is the maturation of HCMV virions, namely tegument acquisition and cytoplasmic envelopment. To provide a molecular description of these events, it is important to identify the factors involved, both viral and cellular. This proposal will focus on two viral proteins, UL88 and UL71. We have previously published a role for UL88 in packaging a subset of tegument proteins into the virion tegument layer and the absence of UL88 decreases viral fitness. Previous work has identified UL71 as an envelopment factor that potentially mediates membrane scission, as viruses lacking UL71 are trapped at various stages of budding. The experiments in this proposal will seek to elucidate the molecular details of how UL88 and UL71 drive tegument acquisition and envelopment, respectively. This includes a detailed analysis of functional regions on each protein as well as an investigation into additional factors that potentially contribute to each process. We will investigate the role of EEA1+ endosomes in tegument acquisition and for the membrane scission factor DNM1 in cytoplasmic envelopment. This proposal will utilize a novel fluorescence-based envelopment to identify additional cellular proteins that participate in envelopment. Taken together, these studies will further our understanding of the molecular events that drive the late stages of HCMV maturation and identify novel ways in which HCMV assembly can be targeted as a potential intervention."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) are highly heritable, severe, and complex brain
disorders. Molecular profiling efforts of the brain have enabled us to understand more about how common
variants may be associated with disease risk via regulating gene expression. However, the status quo as it
pertains to the use of multiomics data for gene-trait association, is limited to independent transcriptome- and
proteome-wide association studies. Here, we propose to: (1) additionally leverage epigenetic datasets and (2)
apply a data-driven correlation-aware meta-analytic approach to integrate a wide range of brain cell-type and
area specific imputed transcriptomes, proteomes and epigenomes. Our preliminary data suggest that this will
greatly increase the power to identify genetically driven gene dysregulation associated with these disorders while
controlling for the correlation between different genomic features.
 First, we will impute brain cell-type (based on FANS/FACS-sorted and single-nucleus data) and brain area
(PFC, ACC, EC, STG, IFG) specific transcriptomes, proteomes and epigenomes for AD, frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Secondly, for each disease, we will perform a data-driven
correlation-aware meta-analysis of these imputed genomic features to identify key genes. Lastly, we will develop
an open resource that provides for the rapid dissemination and open access to analyses and outcomes. To our
knowledge, the proposed approach will result in the largest multiscale modeling of genetically driven gene
dysregulation in the brain, will identify novel genes associated with dementias and will enable similar studies in
other brain disorders as well."
10863858,"SUMMARY
Biological pharmaceuticals, or “biologics”, are among the most important pharmaceuticals in development
today, and their safe manufacture is absolutely crucial for human health. A major problem faced by operators
of bioreactors, at both the laboratory scale and industrial scale, is microbial contamination as an integral risk of
any process that derives from live cell lines. The fundamental concern is to ensure that contaminated biologics
are not injected into the human body. To warrant contamination free biologics a terminal sterilization is often
necessary. The central challenge in this step is the inactivation or removal of microbial contaminates without
causing harm to the precious biologics. This work focuses on antibodies as representative biologics. Especially
for viral and mycoplasma contaminations the terminal sterilization step remains challenging due to the small
size of the pathogens. The industry standard today is removal through passive filtration using filter membranes
with pore diameters smaller or of the same size as the virus particles. This approach requires, however, long
processing times associated with high costs. Furthermore, ultrafiltration can induce antibody self-association
and is not compatible with emerging flexible, small-scale, point-of-care biologics fabrication technologies. The
need for new selective microbe inactivation strategies is also not limited to the field of biologics fabrication. The
Covid19 pandemic has recently illustrated the need for reliable virus inactivation strategies that selectively act
on the virus in tissues but not on proteins, for instance, to allow immunological assays of infected samples
outside of high containment laboratories. Light has sterilization properties, and UV-light has long been used to
inactivate a broad range of microbial pathogens. Unfortunately, it lacks specificity and also damages precious
biologics through reactive photochemistries driven by molecular absorptions in the UV range of the
electromagnetic spectrum. To overcome the shortcomings of both ultrafiltration and UV-irradiation as microbe
inactivation strategies, this proposal develops a plasmonically enhanced photonic inactivation method that
utilizes near-infrared (NIR) light for the selective inactivation of viruses and mycoplasma. As NIR radiation does
not overlap with molecular absorptions, the collateral damage on biologics is minimal. The proposed work will
reveal the fundamental working principles underlying plasmonic pathogen inactivation and implement magnetic
plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) that allow for an easy, contact-free removal of the nanomaterials from the
samples after sterilization. The specific aims of this application are to:
Aim 1: Achieve Reliable Virus Inactivation with NIR Light through Plasmonic Enhancement
Aim 2: Demonstrate a Plasmon-Enhancement Strategy for Mycoplasma Inactivation with NIR Light
Aim 3: Demonstrate Scalable Clearance of Virus and Mycoplasma with Magnetic Plasmonic NPs"

PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERVIEW
Cochlear implants (CI) have become the standard of care for managing profound sensorineural hearing loss.
These devices provide significant improvement in word understanding in quiet but have limitations in noisy
backgrounds. Difficulty understanding speech perception in noise (SiN) in real-world environments is one of
the most common complaints of people with any type of hearing impairment who are seeking hearing
rehabilitation. We believe that the ability to understand SiN is a product of the auditory periphery as well as
plasticity afforded by cortical and cognitive processes. At the level of cortical and cognitive processing, our
prior work has identified a suite of cognitive mechanisms, including figure/ground separation and changes in
lexical processing that interact with the signal quality to impact SiN outcomes. Upon this progress, we now
must expand investigations to better understand the influence of other important factors, such as higher order
cognitive processes (e.g., working memory and executive functioning), with high potential to assist
improvement in SiN abilities among individuals with hearing loss. Furthermore, understanding the effect of
these abilities on communication and socialization in real-world settings and its influence on psychosocial well-
being could have long-term impact on cognitive stability. This grant incorporates a multi-pronged approach to
parse the critical issues at all auditory system levels and as it relates to understanding in real-world listening.
Through utilization of a variety of CI users (e.g., SSD, Bilateral, A+E), we can expand our understanding of: 1)
mechanisms involved in loss of residual acoustic hearing and how those can facilitate better preservation
outcomes; 2) how listeners adapt to and fuse the A+E information to improve hearing in real-world challenging
situations; and 3) whether an individual’s cognitive functioning assist the integration of A+E processing.
Furthermore, we recognize that communication difficulties transcend SiN performance; we will investigate
mechanisms involved with listening in rapid, quiet, or accented speech, reverberant environments, and missing
cues (e.g., wearing face masks). The Iowa Cochlear Implant Clinical Research Center requests competitive
renewal of funding. Four research projects and two cores are proposed in this application. We will leverage the
unique structure of the P50 and our large cohort of CI subjects from our patient registry to develop predictive
models at the group and individual levels incorporating peripheral, cortical, cognitive, and language processing
insights to predict outcomes in real-world challenging listening environments (i.e., natural listening
environments). The four research projects are highly integrated and depend on data from each other to answer
the experimental questions proposed."

10818394,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of this proposal is to advance the understanding of the immune response to and
protective effects of rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections. CT is the most common bacterial sexually
transmitted disease in the world and is associated with substantial reproductive tract morbidity. Rectal CT is
increasingly recognized as a common infection among STI clinic patients, yet despite its high prevalence, there
is no clear data describing how rectal infection affects the immune response to CT or the risk of reinfection. A
better understanding of how the immune system responds to CT infection is urgently needed to inform effective
chlamydia vaccine strategies.
Animal studies in mice and nonhuman primates (NHP) have demonstrated rectal CT infections as non-
pathogenic and persistent, similar to humans infected with non-lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars in
the rectum. Furthermore, studies in the murine model have shown that rectal infection confers trans-mucosal
protection against urogenital challenge, suggesting that rectal CT infection causes enhanced systemic and
transmucosal immune responses to CT. It is possible the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) will be an optimal site for
attenuated mucosal CT vaccines. However, more data on immune responses and potentially protective effects
of rectal infection in NHPs and humans are urgently needed and will be provided in the proposed studies.
Mouse and human studies provide evidence that secretion of IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells is essential for any
protective immunity. The role for antibodies is less clear but appears to rely not on direct neutralization of
bacteria, but rather on secondary functions of the Fc region of antibodies in activating innate and effector cells.
Except for a few mouse model studies, the Fc-dependent functions of anti-CT antibodies remain largely
unexplored. This project will provide informative data describing functional CT protective immunity in NHP
(controlled exposures) and human (cross-sectional sampling) studies.
We will conduct complementary studies in the pig-tailed macaque model and in clinical studies to address the
hypothesis that rectal CT infection induces robust anti-CT immune responses that may protect from genital
disease. We will directly test whether rectal infection in macaques protects against subsequent genital
infection. In both macaques and humans, we will define anti-CT immune responses that may correlate with
protection from reinfection and disease: secretion of IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells, presence of anti-CT antibodies in
the mucosa, and functional antibody responses, using new methods to test for Fc-receptor-mediated functions
of anti-CT antibodies. This project is the first step to demonstrate that rectal infection modifies anti-CT
immunity in NHPs and humans, and will provide important evidence as to whether the GIT could serve as a
mucosal delivery site for future vaccination strategies."

10830377,"Abstract:
 Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a severe mental disorder with a significant burden on public health. MiRNAs are
highly expressed in the brain and have been shown by us and others to play a role in the neuropathology of BPD
and other psychiatric disorders. However, to date, all published postmortem brain miRNA expression studies of
BPD have been hampered by small sample sizes, older detection platforms, and a lack of comprehensive data
integration with other genomic resources.
 To address these limitations, we propose a translational approach that will apply miRNA sequencing in the
amygdala and subgenual cingulate anterior cortex (sAAC) in 150 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and
matched 150 neurotypical controls, followed by a replication study in an independent sample of 100 matched
case/control sample. Our aims are designed to take full advantage of this large and exceptionally well clinically
characterized sample. With our large discovery and replication samples, we are powered to identify moderate to
small effect sizes typically observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. By leveraging other pre-existing genomic
datasets (i.e., GWAS data and RNA-seq) generated in our sample, we will apply a state-of-art series of
bioinformatic and statistical approaches for the comprehensive integration of these genomic data. This
integration will lead to the generation of specific and testable hypotheses. As an example, integrating the miRNA-
seq data with GWAS of BPD (from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) will reveal the genetic mechanisms
by which genome-wide significant risk variants contribute to the etiology of bipolar disorder, e.g., variants
affecting miRNA expression between BPD cases and controls. Integrating the miRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data
will identify miRNA gene targets with important functions in the etiology of bipolar disorder. Finally, we will identify
a set of high confidence risk miRNA of BPD (i.e., miRNAs with convergent evidence from the discovery, eQTL,
bioinformatic, and replication analyses) and deliver these in mice models to delineate the disease-specific
functions and roles these miRNA play in BPD neuropathology.
 In summary, the neurobiological mechanisms by which polymorphisms associated with BPD increase the risk
for bipolar disorder are unknown. We hypothesize that one of the mechanisms contributing to the neuropathology
of BPD is the ability of risk BPD variants to affect miRNA expression. Using such large discovery and replication
brain samples of BPD, we will identify miRNA, whose expression is robustly associated with bipolar disorder and
under the control of risk variants for BPD and further validate their disease functions by testing their impact on
behavioral measures in mice models."
10647666,"Background: The most frequently diagnosed sleep disorder among older Veterans is obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA), which is associated with serious adverse effects on health, quality of life and survival. Positive airway
pressure (PAP) is recommended as first-line treatment (particularly for moderate to severe OSA), but
sustained use is difficult to achieve, including among older Veterans, and nearly half of patients with OSA who
begin PAP therapy discontinue use within a year.
Significance/Impact: Although OSA is a chronic condition, research to date has primarily focused on increasing
initial PAP use in patients with newly diagnosed OSA. In addition, most research has not addressed PAP use
in older adults, which is unfortunate given the high prevalence and important adverse effects of OSA on their
health and well-being. Prior work suggests that behavioral interventions are effective in improving initial PAP
use, but little is known of how to address insufficient use over time.
Innovation: To address this problem, we developed and pilot-tested a structured, manual-based approach to
address insufficient PAP use among older adults with previously diagnosed OSA. The intervention (5 sessions
over 8 weeks, then monthly contact for up to 6 months) is designed so it can be provided by individuals (“sleep
coaches”) from various disciplines (supervised remotely by a psychologist) in a variety of settings for maximal
implementation. Core components of the intervention include: 1) educational and behavioral approaches to
improve PAP use, 2) individualized self-management and troubleshooting techniques to address factors
contributing to insufficient PAP use, and 3) ongoing review of objective PAP use (via remote monitoring).
Specific Aims: Primary Aim 1 will test the efficacy of this intervention for improving PAP usage among older
Veterans with previously diagnosed OSA who have insufficient PAP use. Our hypotheses are that the
intervention will increase objectively measured PAP use at 6-months follow-up, with effects sustained at 12
months. Secondary Aim 2 will test for effects on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and sleep-related function;
and Exploratory Aim 3 will test for effects on health-related quality of life. Our hypotheses are that these
outcomes will also improve at 6 months, and effects will be sustained at 12 months.
Methodology: We propose a randomized, controlled trial to test this new intervention in older Veterans (aged >
65 years, N=90) with previously diagnosed OSA (moderate to severe) who were prescribed PAP 1-5 years in
the past, but have insufficient PAP use (defined as no PAP use over the prior 30 days). Given prior growing
interest in telehealth and remote monitoring approaches to optimize PAP use, and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, all aspects of the study will be performed virtually in keeping with the latest VA COVID-era guidance
for the remote testing and treatment of OSA. Participants will be randomized to the intervention or a control
program that mirrors “optimal usual care” for OSA plus general sleep education (attention control). Structured
assessments at baseline, post-treatment (after session 5) and 6- and 12-months follow-up include objectively
measured PAP use (via remote telemonitoring), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), daytime
sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), sleep-related function (Functional Outcomes of Sleep-10) and health-
related quality of life (PROMIS-29 v2.1 Physical and Mental Health Summary Scores). We will collect
participant experiences and attitudes related to the intervention, and implementation outcome measures
(acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity and staff time as an estimate of cost) to inform future implementation.
Implementation/Next Steps: The long-term goal of this work is to effectively address insufficient PAP use
among older Veterans with OSA to improve their health and quality of life. If successful, we will implement the
intervention at our institution, and develop and disseminate an implementation package with actual tools
needed to promote wider implementation of this model of care into clinical practice."

10839867,"Evidence indicates that prolonged/ repeated behavioral stress promotes brain aging. This is thought to be due,
at least in part, to stress associated glucocorticoid (GC) secretion, which in turn binds to glucocorticoid receptors,
exerting transcriptional and other effects. A key downstream mediator in this signaling pathway, serum-and-
glucocorticoid kinase 1 (Sgk1) accelerates, and the female sex steroid progesterone (P4) blunts, the effects of
GCs. However, despite the negative clinical consequences of chronic stress exposure with aging and/or in
female subjects, little work has examined how aging may change the stress response, the mechanisms through
which stress may accelerate brain aging, the degree to which stress-accelerated aging is dependent on GC, is
driven by Sgk1, or is inhibited by P4. Our preliminary data suggests that hippocampal Sgk1 is upregulated by
aging, stress, and GCs in white matter oligodendrocytes, and that the female sex hormone progesterone (P4)
blunts the effects of stress/GCs and may serve as an endogenous protectant that is lost with age in females.
To address these knowledge gaps, we propose 3 aims to investigate: the age-course of the response to chronic
stress or chronic GCs in males and females; whether viral overexpression of Sgk1 exacerbates, or systemic P4
administration ameliorates, stress-accelerated aging; and whether the pharmacologic sensitivity of hippocampal
tissue to GC and P4 is shifted with age or chronic stress/GC. Cognitive and anxiety-related behavior, blood
hormone measures, and a novel panel of 205 hippocampal genes that are robustly changed with aging across
multiple studies, will be used to test for stress/GC-accelerated aging and intervention effects, as will downstream
gray and white matter Sgk1 expression and microglial response to microinjury- two processes demonstrated to
be glucocorticoid sensitive and exaggerated in white vs. gray matter in preliminary data. Thus, the proposed
studies will yield essentially the first comprehensive test of the hypothesis that chronic stress accelerates
transcriptional brain aging and will illuminate sex differences in stress responsiveness and the potential roles of
GC, P4, and Sgk1 in gray and white matter. Even if all of our working hypotheses are rejected by the results, the
proposed studies should have translational value for geriatric medicine."
10843929,"Project Summary
Hereditary predisposition is the major etiological contributor to diseases leading to bone marrow failure (BMF) in
children. Recently, germline mutations in two interferon responsive genes, SAMD9 and SAMD9L (SAMD9/9L)
were shown to cause a group of multisystemic disorders with the common denominator of BMF with cytopenias
and a propensity for myelodysplasia. Overexpression of wildtype SAMD9/9L results in translation block and
cellular growth inhibition, and these phenotypes are exacerbated by patients’ gain-of-function (GOF) mutations.
The molecular mechanisms by which both wildtype and mutant SAMD9/9L proteins exert these activities are
largely unknown. Moreover, how the mutants impair hematopoiesis is limited by their cell toxic effect and lack of
experimental models. Towards this, by using CRISPR/Cas9 engineering, we have modelled two patient GOF
mutations (V1512M, V1512L) at a recurrently mutated SAMD9L amino acid residue, into the endogenous loci of
human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and mouse (mouse V1507M/L). My preliminary analysis
exhibited decreased erythro- and myelopoiesis upon differentiation of mutant hiPSC-derived hematopoietic
progenitors, and significant anemia with B-cell lymphopenia in mutant mice, with increased severity of
phenotypes in V1512M genotype. Pilot gene expression studies showed a mitochondrial stress signature
depicted by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species pathways in mutants. Further
exploration into the mitochondrial phenotype revealed mutant-specific alteration of mitochondria network and
structure with swollen cristae by electron microscopy, with prominent defect in V1512M. This prompted the
investigation of a physiological link between SAMD9L and mitochondria, which I established by demonstrating a
strong co-localization of Samd9l with mitochondria in mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of
wildtype mice. Altogether, my work suggests SAMD9L to play a role in mitochondria biology. Since mitochondria
are critical for HSC homeostasis, differentiation, and commitment, I hypothesize that SAMD9L mutant-induced
hematotoxicity is mediated by the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. I will pursue this hypothesis through two
specific aims: 1) interrogate the the variable effect of GOF SAMD9L V1512M and V1512L point mutations on
hematopoiesis in a in vivo murine model and 2) determine if SAMD9L V1512M and V1512L affect mitochondrial
structure, function, and dynamics. I will carry out the K99 phase of these aims in an exceptional research
environment under the guidance of Drs. Marcin Wlodarski and John Crispino, and my advisory committees
composed of experts in hematopoiesis, mitochondria biology, and immunology. In the independent phase, I will
extend my studies of the molecular link between SAMD9L and mitochondria in hematopoiesis and exploit
molecular reporters to refine this link. The institutional resources, academic environment and the planned
courses outlined in my proposal will ensure my successful transition to independence."
10804662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, tendinopathy,
intervertebral disc degeneration and many more continue to be the leading causes of disability
worldwide, imposing an enormous socioeconomic burden on the health care system in this
country. This era has also ushered in paradigm-shifting scientific revolutions in tissue and
regenerative medicine, in vivo and ex vivo disease modeling, sequencing and genomics, high-
resolution imaging and biomechanics. These developments at the bench side require
multidisciplinary expertise in science, engineering, and medicine to continue to accelerate the
trajectory of musculoskeletal research to ultimately address unmet clinical needs at the bedside.
However, research training in musculoskeletal research continues to be largely siloed into single
discipline approaches and settings. In this application, we propose a new Integrated
Musculoskeletal Training Program (IMTP) that brings together world leading musculoskeletal
researchers and clinicians at Columbia University with expertise in biomedical engineering, cell
and molecular biology, pathology and cell biology, mechanical engineering and innovation. This
unique predoctoral training program focuses on integrating the multiple disciplines required for
cutting edge research training of the next generation of scientists and engineers in the field. The
proposed T32 training program will establish a unique training paradigm in musculoskeletal
disease, with the following required training elements: (1) clinical preceptorship in musculoskeletal
medicine (orthopaedic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, rheumatology, radiology,
etc.), (2) mandatory co-advising by a team consisting of a bioengineer, biologist, and a clinician,
(3) innovation and design training for identifying clinical needs and gaps in knowledge /
technology, and (4) training in diversity and equity challenges. This T32 training program will
provide a unique and timely opportunity to promote, enhance, and deepen multidisciplinary
musculoskeletal research by supporting trainees with the skills and the values needed to enter
the biomedical research workforce and to solve the complex problems of musculoskeletal disease
in the future."

 The planned activities describe a set of efforts that will build upon my interest in developmental therapeutics
and childhood leukemias. I will lead a team of physicians, research nurses, clinical research coordinators in the
Pediatric Oncology and Developmental Therapeutics (DVL) Program at the HICCC and develop a portfolio of
clinical trials, which includes NCI-sponsored studies. My goal is to increase the number of accruals to the DVL
clinical trials, which is already excellent, by expanding with marketing efforts and also grow the portfolio of clinical
trials at HICCC. I will continue my involvement in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Myeloid Disease
Committee and Developmental Therapeutics Committee. I will carry on my efforts in my current PI or co-PI
positions for open trials, i.e. the COG AAML1921 and AAML18P1 studies. I will develop a new COG study to
evaluate a novel method of dose de-escalation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors before treatment-free remission in
children with CML working with a junior faculty. In addition, I hope to identify barriers to the accrual of minority
patients in pediatric developmental therapeutics studies and institute a plan to improve it.
 I am devoted to mentoring and training young faculty who will develop next generation research in pediatric
oncology. I will continue my efforts to train residents and fellows interested in pediatric oncology. I will help junior
faculty to establish their roles at HICCC/CUIMC and also expand their academic opportunities in cooperative
groups and collaborations with outside investigators."
10865036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Worldwide, more than 500,000 children become blind each year, and the majority of blind children live in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs), where rates of preventable vision loss and blindness are significantly
higher. Amblyopia is the leading cause of vision loss in children worldwide. Vision loss from amblyopia can be
prevented through early, effective amblyopia screening, though current screening devices have high sensitivity
and low specificity which leads to a high number of false positive referrals. This ultimately limits the success of
amblyopia screening programs due to increased cost and resource utilization, which is of particular concern in
LMICs and low resource settings. This proposal will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two
amblyopia screening devices and screening strategies: a current standard device, autorefractor (AR), which
only detects amblyopia risk factors, and a novel device, retinal birefringence scanner (RBS), which detects
amblyopia directly. Aim 1 of this proposal will compare the performance of the AR and RBS devices for
detecting amblyopia in a clinic-based setting in Nepal. Aim 2 will compare the devices in a community-based
setting in Nepal. Aim 3 will compare the cost-effectiveness of these two amblyopia screening strategies and
devices. The feasibility of these Aims is anchored by collaboration with the Village Integrated Eye Worker II
(VIEW II) trial, a cluster-randomized trial led by the candidate’s primary mentor, Dr. Jeremy Keenan. The VIEW
II trial randomizes adults in peri-urban communities in Nepal to undergo a vision screening intervention by
trained community outreach workers. This proposal incorporates several innovations. First, it uniquely
leverages a well-established adult vision screening infrastructure to create and evaluate a screening program
for children. Second, it will be the first study to directly compare the performance and cost of two amblyopia
screening strategies. The candidate, Dr. Julius Oatts is a pediatric ophthalmologist at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF), whose long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with
expertise in diagnostic accuracy studies for novel technologies to diagnose and monitor preventable vision loss
in children nationally and internationally. To successfully complete this research, Dr. Oatts will focus on four
relevant domains of training: diagnostic accuracy studies, clinical trial design, cost-effectiveness analysis, and
epidemiology and biostatistics. His exceptional mentorship team includes his primary mentor, Dr. Jeremy
Keenan, Director of International Programs at the Proctor Foundation and PI of the VIEW II trial, and co-
mentors Dr. David Hunter, Chief of Ophthalmology at Boston Children’s Hospital, and Dr. Ying Han, Director of
the UCSF Glaucoma service. This team, combined with the environment of the Proctor Foundation and UCSF
Department of Ophthalmology, will support his development into an NIH-funded independent investigator."
10849735,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent increases in psychopathology across multiple dimensions have a significant detrimental impact on
morbidity, mortality and well-being during this period of life, and set the stage for adult physical and mental health
difficulties. Prevalence rates of internalizing psychopathology, which is higher on average in females, and
externalizing psychopathology, higher in males, diverge during adolescence, and this trajectory continues on
subsequently over the lifespan, implicating sex-differentiated mechanisms. Consistent with this, a robust
literature supports individual differences in pubertal timing (e.g., onset) and pubertal tempo (e.g., rate of change)
as risk-factors for increased psychopathology. However, reliance on single sex-specific indicators, retrospective
reports, and cross-sectional data to measure this dynamic period of maturation have made identification of
mechanisms driving puberty and psychopathology links difficult. The current study aims to capitalize on
measured genomics approaches integrated with longitudinal data in both sexes to inform the genomic signal of
puberty across multiple physical and hormonal indicators, and examine genetic covariation between puberty and
psychopathology across the lifespan. The first aim will leverage the novel method of genomic structural equation
modeling (genomic SEM; training aim 1) to combine summary statistics from published genome-wise association
studies (GWAS) of pubertal timing (i.e., age of menarche, relative age of voice break, relative age of first facial
hair), pubertal growth spurt, pubertal maturation (i.e., Tanner staging), testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG) to identify latent pubertal genomic factors both specific to and unified across sex.
Polygenic scores (PGS; training aim 2) derived from the multivariate pubertal genomic factors will be validated
by out-of-sample prediction of longitudinally measured pubertal timing and tempo characterized by multiple
pubertal markers in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The second aim is to investigate
measured genetic covariance of multivariate pubertal genomic signal with lifespan sex-differentiated
psychopathology (training aim 3). This will be achieved through (a) examining correlations between the pubertal
genomic factor model and previously established factor models of the genetic architecture of adult psychiatric
traits using genomic SEM, and estimating pubertal PGS prediction of sex-specific lifetime psychiatric diagnoses
in the UKBiobank; and (b) probing sex-specific and sex-unified pubertal PGS effects on longitudinally modeled
adolescent symptoms of psychopathology in the ABCD Study, both directly and in conjunction with longitudinally
measured pubertal timing and tempo. This research will yield a comprehensive model of measured genomic
signal of puberty across multiple related phenotypes in both sexes, and provide improved tools for parsing
genetic and non-genetic sources of covariation to disentangle multilayered mechanisms underlying pubertal risk
for psychopathology."
10812466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a growing marketplace for e-cigarettes and legal cannabis vaping products that appeal to adolescents.
Adolescent nicotine and cannabis vaping is prevalent, co-use of nicotine and cannabis vaping is common, and
many youth purchase vaping products from physical retailers (e.g., vape shops and dispensaries). Greater
density of tobacco and cannabis retailers around adolescents’ homes and schools may influence youth vaping
initiation and dependence via increased access and exposure to marketing. Nicotine and cannabis vaping are
intertwined, and the tobacco retail environment may influence youth cannabis vaping, and vice-versa. However,
few studies have examined the effect of retailer density on youth nicotine and cannabis vaping, including whether
tobacco retail density influences cannabis vaping, and whether cannabis dispensary density influences nicotine
vaping. Data are also lacking on whether the impact of retailer density on youth cannabis and nicotine vaping is
disproportionately higher among those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, leading to disparities in cannabis
and tobacco use. The goal of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to investigate the
impact of the tobacco and cannabis retail environment and neighborhood disadvantage on adolescent nicotine
and cannabis vaping, and to provide new training to prepare me for a career as an independent investigator with
a focus on tobacco and cannabis regulatory science, and the ability to secure R01-level funding. I will use four
years of data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of high school students in Southern CA (N~4,000),
alongside data on licensed and unlicensed tobacco retailers and cannabis dispensaries, and census-block
measures of neighborhood disadvantage to evaluate the project aims: (Aim 1) to examine the association of
tobacco retailer and cannabis dispensary density with adolescent nicotine and cannabis vaping; (Aim 2) to
assess the moderating role of individual- and neighborhood-disadvantage on the association of tobacco retailer
and cannabis dispensary density with adolescent nicotine and cannabis vaping; and (Aim 3) to collect new data
through in-depth store observations in a geographic subsample to identify specific store characteristics (e.g.,
marketing, minimum-age verification, product availability) that contribute to adolescent nicotine and cannabis
vaping. Findings will provide critically needed information to policymakers considering new regulations that
protect the public health of youth. This work will also inform future research on additional dimensions of tobacco
and cannabis policies (e.g., home deliveries, pricing) and their impact on youth tobacco and cannabis use on a
national level. This K01 leverages my existing expertise and addresses critical gaps in my training by providing
new training in: 1) cannabis regulatory science; 2) socioecological determinants of youth tobacco and cannabis
use; and 3) spatial analysis. I have worked closely with my mentors (selected based on their expertise in each
training area) to develop an ambitious but feasible training plan that incorporates expert mentoring, coursework
and seminars, scientific meetings, and continued development of grant writing and research dissemination skills."
10867476,"SUMMARY
Alpha herpesviruses are a subfamily of ubiquitous viruses that can cause a spectrum of clinically-significant
diseases including blindness from acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Unfortunately, even with timely antiviral
treatment, irreversible pathological changes occur within the retina and significantly increase the risk of vision-
threatening complications to further compromise an already poor visual prognosis. Since the advent of
acyclovir, there have been no major advances in the treatment of clinically-significant herpes infections despite
the vision-degrading complications and very little is known in regards to the immune response to the virus
within the retina. This proposal will provide a fundamental understanding of the innate immune response to
HSV-1 within the retina, while developing critical skills in career development. The long-term goal of this
project is to acquire the scientific skills needed to enhance our understanding and pursue novel therapies to
preserve vision and reduce complications related to ARN as an independent clinician-scientist.
 The scientific objective of this K08 proposal is to test the hypothesis that type I interferons (IFNs) are
central to host defense to viral infection of the retina and that toll-like receptor-3 within retinal microglia activate
this innate immune response. We propose evaluating the innate immune response to herpes virus infections
of the retina by utilizing several immune knock-out mouse lines, human retinal cell cultures, and vitreous
specimens from patients with ARN to assess the role of IFNs and their role in neuroinflammation. Three
focused specific aims will be utilized to test our hypothesis: 1) Identify pathways and cell types responsible for
HSV innate immunity within the retina; 2) Determine the role of downstream IFNs in host defense against viral
infection of the retina; 3) Identify the predominate IFN subtype and cellular source in acute retinal necrosis
from human samples.
 The career development objective is to develop the mentorship and expertise needed to become a
productive and independent clinician-scientist. The Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and
the University of Nebraska Medical Center have state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and world-class faculty with
expertise in neuroimmunology, viral infections, and innate immune signaling to serve as the mentoring team.
The institutional resources, mentorship team, and career development plan have been developed to
specifically promote scientific independence in the study of neuroinflammation of the retina."

studies), and its community engagement (>200 community partners) and the integration of research in health
practice across western Pennsylvania (>250K research participants in Pitt+Me Registry). We established
clinical and translational science as a new academic discipline across Pitt and its affiliated healthcare system,
UPMC, and created the infrastructure and workforce needed to sustain it. We are now poised to pivot from
successfully enabling the sequential translation of individual studies to systematically accelerating the real-
world impact of research. We define “research impact” as changing standards of care through the
dissemination and sustained implementation of best practices supported by translational research evidence.
Over the next 5 years, we will provide the training, resources, and expertise necessary for CTSI-supported
studies to develop a “path to impact” and thus support progress toward achieving our mission: CTSI will
accelerate the dissemination and implementation, and hence the impact, of translational research. Each CTSI
program has new activities specifically designed to support specific steps on the path from idea to impact:
Team Assembly, Study Design, Study Conduct, Dissemination & Implementation. We will create translational
research teams who envision the impact of their work on the communities that they seek to benefit (patients,
providers, policymakers, etc.) at each step of the research process, from conceptualizing questions through
implementing findings. Every CTSI-supported study will be “designed for impact”."
10897759,"ABSTRACT
Cancers are dynamic biological entities whose clonal architecture can change under strong selection pressures,
such as exposure to therapy. As tumors progress through different stages, they coevolve with stromal
populations, which in aggregate constitutes a significant challenge in assessing the potential value of new
therapeutic strategies. Recent discoveries by us and other groups have provided a glimpse of the complexity of
the clonal architecture of many tumors, their dynamics under therapy, and their interactions with the immune
system. In most tumors, several sub-clonal populations simultaneously co-exist, and initially minor clones play a
dominant role in subsequent phases of the tumor’s evolution. As clonal and stromal heterogeneity emerge as
driving forces underlying cancer progression and therapeutic failure, there is a critical need for uncovering the
quantitative fundamental principles underlying the evolution of tumors and their dynamic interaction with their
microenvironment. My recent work has shown that tumor evolution does not proceed in a stochastic fashion but
through a highly structured process, and that future dominant subclones can both be identified and targeted. The
quantitative approaches developed by my group in the last few years are particularly tailored to elucidate the
evolutionary patterns of clonal systems under strong selection. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that (1)
tumor and stroma coevolve in an orchestrated fashion, (2) seeding clones can be identified through genomic and
single cell longitudinal sampling, (3) these clones can be targeted, and (4) in order to characterize these clones
we need to develop new quantitative approaches. The overarching goal of the present proposal is to uncover the
mechanisms by which small tumor and stromal populations coevolve and drive tumor progression and the
emergence of drug resistance, using glioblastoma as a paradigm. Quantitative approaches and fundamental
principles of tumor evolution derived from this research will then be applied to other tumor types."
10872280,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The cytoplasm is a crowded subcellular environment that is packed with organelles, proteins, nucleic acids
and other large macromolecules, as well as water and small molecules. How cell biological processes
function in this milieu remains poorly understood. Macromolecules present in the cytoplasm are thought to
exert physical forces that contribute to cytoplasmic organization, phase separation, and osmotic pressure.
Cellular density, which is the concentration of cellular components such as proteins and nucleic acids, is a
key predictor of these macromolecular crowding effects. Recent evidence from our lab and others reveals
that density and macromolecular crowding effects are not constant but actually change during the cell cycle,
as well in various physiological and disease states, and during development. However, little is known about
how these changes impact cellular physiology and mechanics. Thus, cellular density and the effects of
macromolecular crowding represent critical but understudied aspects of cellular physiology that likely impact
most cellular processes.
 The general goals are to elucidate physical- and molecular- based mechanisms responsible for
cellular processes responsible for cell growth and division: mitosis, microtubule dynamics, nuclear size
control, chromosome mobility and cell wall assembly. A general thrust of the investigations is to determine
how the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm impact these diverse cellular processes.
In particular, our studies will address how intracellular osmotic pressures generated by macromolecules act
to dampen microtubule dynamics, inflate the nucleus, modulate the mechanics of the mitotic spindle, and
regulate chromosome motility for DNA repair. Approaches include innovative live cell assays for the
biophysical properties of living cells (e.g. microrheology and quantitative phase imaging) and quantitative
cell biology approaches in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
 These studies will establish a foundation for the emerging field of cellular density and will contribute
to our understanding of a fundamental but understudied aspect of cell biology. This work will significantly
impact our understanding of mechanisms governing cell growth and division that are relevant for biomedical
applications including cancer, aging and fungal pathogenesis."

who use cutting edge translational neuroscience methods. We have developed a new seminar series to
provide trainees an introduction to next-generation analytic methods such as computational modeling,
integrative omics, and machine learning. We provide a new plan for instruction in methods for enhancing
reproducibility. We have expanded the role of the Training Committee in monitoring trainee progress,
increased the frequency of formal monitoring of trainee progress, and established an External Advisory
Committee. Finally, we have developed additional approaches to further enhance recruitment of trainees from
URM groups and those with disabilities. With a >7-fold excess of highly qualified, eligible applicants for
available slots, T32 MH16804 can support the requested expansion to 5 slots, increasing the positions
available to high priority groups (e.g. those from under-represented minorities or with MD/PhD training) that we
have been successful in recruiting. Increasing to five slots will also provide an optional 3rd year for trainees
who need longer to transition to independence. With these changes, T32 MH16804 will be poised to further
impact the field by preparing an expanded cohort of translational neuroscientists to make transformative
discoveries in psychiatry."
10844611,"Global health is a multi-disciplinary field that aims to improve health equity for individuals, families and
populations worldwide. Nurse scientists are uniquely positioned to develop research to understand public health
problems, inform health interventions, optimize health systems, and promote health within communities and
across populations. Importantly, global health is concerned with problems that transcend national borders, both
abroad in other countries and domestically in the United States. This global to local approach prioritizes
international cooperation and collaboration from multiple disciplines to achieve health equity through evidence-
based prevention and clinical care for those disproportionately burdened with illness and most in need of health
services. The National Institute of Nursing Research supports global health research to achieve its mission of
advancing nursing science to improve the health and well-being of all the world’s citizens. Accordingly, there is
a need to train a cadre of nurse scientists who pursue scholarly careers to lead and contribute to research on
global health issues. The Research in Nursing and Global Health (RiNGH) training program, coordinated by the
University of Washington Center for Global Health Nursing and the University of Washington School of Nursing’s
Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will prepare pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees with the knowledge
and skills to advance global health equity through team-based, interdisciplinary research. Trainees will benefit
from a variety of learning experiences spanning coursework, research seminars, research residencies,
independent research projects, professional development and career building workshops, and participation in
scientific meetings and conferences. Trainees will have access to a group of established, committed
investigators in Nursing and other health sciences disciplines with sustained programs of research related to
global health and health equity to serve as mentors and guide their overall training. The specific aims of the
RiNGH training program are to: (1) recruit and retain a diverse group of qualified, promising pre-doctoral and
post-doctoral trainees to conduct research aiming to improve population health and healthcare globally and
locally, using a health equity lens; (2) provide interdisciplinary, didactic research training in current and emerging
theories, methodologies, and skills essential for conducting global health and health equity research; including
the appraisal, design, and implementation of research approaches; (3) mentor trainees in principles and values
of respectful community engagement and ethical conduct of research, especially in contexts involving
marginalized, underserved populations abroad and domestically; (4) prepare future scholars for competitive
research careers in academia, research centers, healthcare systems, government agencies, non-government
organizations, foundations, or industry, through learning experiences and professional development as well as
exposure to active research projects with foci in global health and health equity; and, (5) evaluate pre-doctoral
and post-doctoral training program structures, processes, and outcomes on an ongoing and annual basis."

SUMMARY
The
placental
 precise mechanisms causing abnormal fetal growth remain to be fully established, however changes in
 amino acid transport may contribute to both IUGR and fetal overgrowth. The Large Neutral Amino
Acid Transporter Small Subunit 1 (LAT1) mediates transplacental transfer of essential amino acids and thyroid
hormones by the transporter System L. Importantly, placental System L amino acid transporter activity is
decreased in human IUGR and increased in fetal overgrowth in women. However, it remains unknown if
changes in the expression/activity of placental LAT1 are mechanistically linked to placental function, fetal
growth and offspring cardiometabolic outcomes. Importantly, global Lat1 deletion leads to embryonic lethality in
mid-gestation in mice, making it difficult to determine the role of LAT1 for placental function. Other genes,
albeit not embryonically lethal, may influence both early placental development and the function of the
established placenta, requiring tools to `turn-off' or `turn-on' genes at specific time points of gestation. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop approaches to achieve inducible, trophoblast-specific gene modulation. The
objective of this proposal is to develop and validate novel approaches for inducible trophoblast-specific gene
modulation in mice and to test the central hypothesis that restoring normal trophoblast Lat1 expression rescues
the embryonic lethality of global Lat1 deletion and that trophoblast-specific Lat1 knockdown after the
establishment of the placenta decreases placental transport of essential amino acids and inhibits placental
mTOR, mitochondrial respiration and protein synthesis, restricts fetal growth and programs offspring
metabolism and cardiovascular function. We propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate mice
with inducible trophoblast-specific Lat1 gene modulation. Our approach will be to generate mice with
doxycycline-inducible, trophoblast-specific Lat1 gene knockdown or rescue in Lat1-/- embryos using piggyBac
transposase-enhanced transgenesis, lentivirus-mediated transduction of blastocysts and tetraploid
complementation assay, respectively. Aim 2: Determine the effect of trophoblast-specific Lat1 modulation
on placental function, fetal growth and offspring long-term outcomes. Our approach will be to (1) induce
Lat1 knockdown after the establishment of the placenta and (2) rescue trophoblast Lat1 gene expression in
global Lat1 knockout (Lat1-/-) embryos. We will determine transplacental transport of amino acids and thyroid
hormones, placental mTOR signaling activity, mitochondrial respiration and protein synthesis, fetal growth and
offspring long-term metabolic and cardiovascular function Aim 3: Establish the effect of LAT1 modulation
on primary human trophoblast syncytialization and function. Our approach will be to isolate primary
human trophoblast (PHT) cells from term placentas and determine syncytialization, amino acid and thyroid
hormone uptake, mTOR signaling, mitochondrial respiration and protein synthesis in control PHT cells, in PHT
cell with siRNA mediated LAT1 knockdown and in PHT cells with LAT1 overexpression."

Despite ongoing advances in auditory prostheses, patients with hearing loss often have difficulty understanding
speech and other important sounds in noisy environments. This is due, in part, to degraded spatial and
spectral sound information, which is leveraged by normal-hearing listeners to parse concurrent sounds in the
real world. Current understanding of spatial processing is drawn primarily from studies in which the subject is
head-fixed relative to the sound sources. Despite this dominant experimental paradigm, listeners in real-world
conditions typically move through space while orienting their head to improve their ability to understand
auditory signals. The existence of neural connections between the vestibular, motor, and auditory systems
suggests that a listener's movement and body posture provide substantial input to the auditory system to
facilitate hearing. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates while moving through an
acoustic environment will support new treatments for auditory disorders.
The current study will investigate how information about a listener's motion and body/head posture influence
sound processing in the auditory cortex. Historically, studies in free-moving subjects have been limited by the
difficulty of precisely measuring auditory input during unconstrained movement through a complex sound field.
Recent advances in computing, machine learning, and neural recording technology now make this problem
tractable. There are two specific aims. The first is to simultaneously record from large numbers of auditory
cortex neurons during free movement through a calibrated sound field. These experiments will develop the
equipment, experimental approach, and computational techniques needed to accurately track the sound input
to each ear during movement through an auditory scene. The second aim will evaluate how the position and
self-motion impact sound coding in auditory cortex. Recently developed methods use artificial neural networks
to predict the activity in single neurons evoked by complex natural sounds. These algorithms will be updated to
include body posture and self-motion as inputs, allowing measurement of how response properties may
change based on these variables. By characterizing dynamic sound coding in free-moving animals, these
studies will provide new insight into how the auditory system processes sound under more natural conditions
and can support improved signal processing algorithms for auditory prostheses."

 DNA mismatch repair (MMR) plays critical roles in eukaryotic cells including: 1) suppressing mutations that
result from misincorportation errors during DNA replication that escape DNA polymerase proofreading; 2)
suppressing mutations that result from misincorporation events that occur due to chemical modification of DNA
or DNA precursors; 3) preventing genome rearrangements due to recombination between divergent DNA
sequences; 4) correcting mispaired bases in recombination intermediates; and 5) detecting DNA damage and
activating signaling pathways linked to cellular responses, including cell cycle control and cell death.
Consequently, MMR defects cause increased rates of accumulating mutations and genome rearrangements
resulting in a characteristic genome instability signature and resistance to killing by some DNA damaging
agents. In humans, MMR defects underlie both inherited and sporadic cancers, cause tumors to become
resistant to some chemotherapy agents and appear to cause quite striking sensitivity of cancers to
immunotherapy. Thus, a better understanding of MMR pathways and the consequences of MMR defects will
impact human health by: 1) informing our understanding of MMR status; and 2) guiding improvements in the
development and use of therapies for MMR-deficient cancers.
 The proposed studies use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to study the mechanisms of the
conserved eukaryotic MMR pathways. The following lines of investigation will be carried out: 1) genetic
approaches will be used to study Msh2- and Mlh1-interacting proteins, identify new MMR proteins and study
the activation of the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease; 2) reconstitution approaches will be used to study the MMR
pathways in which mispair excision is mediated by either Exo1 or the Rad27 endonuclease focusing on mispair
excision mechanisms, the recruitment of Exo1 and Rad27 to MMR reactions and whether DNA pol ε can act in
Rad27-mediated MMR; 3) reconstitution approaches will be used to study MMR pathways that are dependent
on the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease including pathways where Mlh1-Pms1 initiates mispair excision by Exo1 and
Rad27 and a novel, newly reconstituted pathway where mispair excision is mediated only by Mlh1-Pms1;
and, 4) individual steps in MMR reactions will be studied primarily by investigating the protein-protein
interactions and higher order complexes of proteins that drive MMR using Surface Plasmon Resonance and
single molecule biochemistry methods. The long-term goal of these studies is to develop a detailed
understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of MMR and how cells utilize MMR to prevent
mutations and genome rearrangements. Because MMR is highly conserved, the results from studies of S.
cerevisiae MMR will provide insights into the mechanisms of MMR in human cells. Consequently, this project
will provide insights that can be applied to understanding the genetics of human cancers and the biology of
MMR defects in human cancers in addition to providing a basic understanding of MMR mechanisms."

Currently, there are no effective therapies to replace degenerated neurons in patients with retina neuron loss
from degenerative diseases, such as occurs in patients with glaucoma and macular degeneration. By contrast,
retinas of non-mammalian vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, show a robust regenerative response
following retinal damage. Upon injury to the retina, fish Muller Glia generate all different types of retinal
neurons to replace those that were lost. There has been considerable progress in understanding the molecular
mechanisms of regeneration in non-mammalian vertebrates, and if this knowledge could be applied to humans,
it might lead to the development of new types of regenerative therapies for patients with impaired vision. Five
years ago, we discovered that by expressing a key proneural regulatory gene, called Ascl1, in the Muller glia of
mice, we can induce them to regenerate new neurons after injury. The new regenerated neurons in the mouse
retinas wired up with the existing, undamaged neurons and became functional. These results showed for the
first time that functional neuron regeneration is possible in mammals, like ourselves; however, we have found
that additional factors are likely required to guide the regeneration to the proper types and numbers of neurons
needed to address specific diseases. In this proposal, our aim is to better define the specific transcription factor
combinations that best regenerate each of the major retinal neurons types. We also propose to determine
whether the types of neurons regenerated by the Muller glia are influenced by the type of retinal injury, and
whether the process can be made efficient enough to restore functional vision in animal models of retinal
degeneration. Lastly, we propose studies to better understand the signaling pathways that could be harnessed
to further direct the MG-mediated regeneration process. At the end of five years, we expect to have further
refined the potential for regeneration in the treatment of retinal disease and trauma."

Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have emerged at the forefront of gene therapy as promising
vectors for treating a wide spectrum of diseases. Despite the approval of 3 different AAV gene therapy products
for ocular (Luxturna), neuromuscular (Zolgensma) and metabolic (Glybera) disorders, several challenges remain
– most notably, the need for high doses of AAV to achieve therapeutic efficacy. This drawback imposes a
significant burden on manufacturing processes and also the risk of dose dependent clinical toxicity. To this end,
it is important to study key aspects of AAV biology that can profoundly influence manufacturing processes, vector
yield and quality, which in turn impacts clinical outcomes. The current proposal is centered around one key
question – how does AAV exit the host cell? Upon co-infection with a helper virus such as Adenovirus or
Herpesvirus, wild type AAV undergoes a transition from a latent to lytic life cycle, hijacking the host cell machinery
to lyse the cell. However, it is well known that during rAAV vector production, a significant fraction is secreted
into media supernatant (as free or extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated particles), while a fraction is still retained
within the producer cell. Despite this knowledge, the urgent need for process optimization and scale up in AAV
manufacturing has resulted in adoption of upstream process/harvest steps in recombinant AAV production that
involve detergent lysis of producer cells. This process step generates large quantities of cell lysate that is then
subject to heavily burdened downstream processing steps that can result in compromised vector yield and
quality. Recent work has revealed a novel +1 frameshifted open reading frame (ORF) in the VP1 region of the
AAV cap gene that mediates expression of the membrane-associated accessory protein (MAAP). In the current
proposal, we highlight exciting new findings from our lab that assign a novel function to MAAP in promoting AAV
egress from host cells. Our overall scientific premise is based on strong supportive evidence that MAAP
promotes AAV egress by hijacking host cell secretory pathways. Thus, the current proposal is focused on further
dissecting the mechanism of MAAP-mediated AAV extracellular secretion. Specific goals of the proposal are to
(1) dissect the role of MAAP as an egress factor for different AAV clades, (2) determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying MAAP function and AAV secretion and (3) engineer novel MAAPs and stable MAAP
producer cell lines for enhanced AAV secretion. Our overarching goal is to study and engineer AAV secretion to
streamline process development and improve the clinical safety profile as determined by AAV vector quality."

IPUMS is a family of nine integrated databases that comprise the largest and most intensively-used data
resource for research on population dynamics and health. This competing continuation proposal has two main
goals. First, the project will provide the primary support for expanding, improving, and maintaining IPUMS-USA,
which consists of microdata from decennial censuses and American Community Surveys. Second, the project
will provide central coordination across the nine IPUMS databases, exploiting synergies and eliminating
redundant work. Over the past five years, IPUMS has seen explosive growth in the number of researchers using
the database, the amount of data they request, and the number of high-impact publications they produce. At the
same time, however, there is unprecedented demand from researchers for expansion, improvement, and support
of the infrastructure. This project will undertake four major activities to meet this demand:
1. Database Expansion. We will add data from the American Community Survey and the 1950 census, update
 variables to accommodate new standards, and evaluate new Census Bureau disclosure controls.
2. IPUMS-FSRDC. We will make IPUMS data housed in the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers more
 usable through comprehensive documentation, streamlined access, and improvement of the restricted
 microdata, including new harmonized small-area identifiers.
3. Data Access Redesign. We will redesign the IPUMS user interface and provide new tools for variable
 discovery and data sharing, including a new user interface conforming to modern accessibility standards,
 simplified data sharing for replication and collaboration, and enhancement of our online data analysis tool.
4. IPUMS Coordination. The project will synchronize technological development, user support and outreach,
 and long-run planning for preservation and sustainability across the nine IPUMS databases to avoid
 duplication of effort, increase the impact, and reduce the cost of IPUMS data infrastructure.
IPUMS reduces costs for the population and health research community by minimizing redundant effort,
simplifying data access, increasing the replicability of studies, and improving data reliability. The availability of
large-scale integrated microdata has opened extraordinary new opportunities for fine-grained contextual
analyses of population dynamics and health, resulting in transformational research across a diverse range of
topics and disciplines."

 Common mental health disorders (CMDs), like depression and anxiety, and non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), like diabetes and hypertension, are highly prevalent and are the leading causes of death and
disability worldwide, especially in low-resource settings like our research site in Nepal. Comorbidity among
CMDs and NCDs is high and the relationship between these conditions is complex and multidirectional.
Several common behavioral risk factors worsen both conditions: stress, isolation, tobacco use, low physical
activity, low quality diet, and poor treatment adherence. Behavioral interventions can address these common
risk factors, and improve CMDs and NCDs. The World Health Organization's (WHO) two clinical protocols for
CMDs and NCDs recommend three behavioral interventions: a) evidence-based stress reduction (EBSR) for
stress/anxiety; b) behavioral activation (BA) for depression; and c) motivational interviewing (MI) for healthy
behaviors. Despite this potential, these interventions are rarely available in low-resource settings because of
two important gaps: 1) behavioral interventions have often been studied for one or two CMDs and NCDs,
rather than for the real-world need of an integrated intervention to simultaneously address multiple CMDs and
NCDs; and 2) these interventions have not been studied using implementation strategies that can support easy
access (i.e., making care available at or near the patient's home) and sustained implementation in real-world
settings. Based on our extensive history and long-term commitment to working in Nepal, we now propose a
hybrid implementation-effectiveness study of BECOME (BEhavioral Community-based COmbined Intervention
for MEntal Health and Noncommunicable Diseases) delivered by community health workers (CHWs) in Nepal.
 Our team has a long-standing history of conducting implementation research, integrating evidence-
based care for CMDs and NCDs into existing health-care systems in Nepal, training CHWs to deliver
behavioral interventions at or near patient's homes, and conducting costing analysis. We have an extensive
history of collaborating with the Government of Nepal and have a deep understanding of social norms and
cultural factors that drive sustained healthcare delivery. The proposed study has three aims to address the
gaps identified above: Aim 1) assess the effectiveness of BECOME on depression, anxiety, and two NCDs via
a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (20 geographic clusters) and participants (n=600) with at least one
CMD and one NCD; Aim 2) assess implementation outcomes of BECOME using the Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework at the patient, provider, and health system
levels; and Aim 3) conduct a comprehensive costing analysis to provide strategic inputs to support long-term
scale-up of BECOME. If successful, this study will provide evidence and a blueprint to the governments of
Nepal and other low-resource settings with an integrated intervention and a set of implementation strategies to
deliver behavioral interventions for CMDs and NCDs."

Despite the increasing attention to the “culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD)” communities in research and
clinical practice, monolingual speakers of minority languages living in the United States (US), such as foreign-
born populations who speak a language other than English, have been nearly excluded from speech
rehabilitation. This is mainly because of the assumption that the target language of intervention is English
regardless of the cultural and linguist background of the patients. The goal of the proposed project, framed by
the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health ICF), is (1) to address missing personal
and environmental factors of the foreign-born populations who are in need of speech rehabilitation and (2) to
develop and conduct a small-scale clinical trial that incorporates these missing factors into a speech
intervention program.
 For an initial effort, a total of 32 Korean-speakers with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and their families will
participate in the study. To overcome the primary obstacles of delivering speech therapy in Korean, such as the
availability of Korean speech rehabilitation programs in US, we employ two recent rehabilitation delivery models:
telepractice and group therapy. PD participants will receive speech therapy consisting of 16 sessions of 60
minutes duration delivered over four weeks using a telehealth platform. PD families will attend weekly, 1-hour,
family training and support sessions, which will provide family counseling and conversation training. Primary
(speech intelligibility, acoustic measures) and secondary (communication participation, health and well-being)
outcome measures will be obtained from Pre-, Post-, and Follow-up timepoints.
 The primary deliverable will be the initial stage for an interdisciplinary speech intervention model for
speakers with communication disorders who cannot receive speech therapy in English. Further, health literacy
among linguistically and culturally diverse groups will be enhanced. The long-term goal is to expand the
number and scope of populations with quality health care access and to develop speech intervention programs
that incorporate sophisticated attention to personal and environmental factors specific to the target clinical
populations."

The microbiome of the eye and adnexal structures has not been well-characterized to date. The periocular eyelid
margin has a substantial microbiome, and may be involved in disease states including blepharitis, Meibomian
gland disease, dry eye syndrome, hordeolum, and chalazion. Preliminary data from our group suggest that,
while the lid margin microbiome is relatively consistent between eyes and across time in individuals, there is
substantial variation between individuals. The full extent of variability and the causes for these differences are
not known.
We propose studying the well-characterized, healthy TwinsUK cohort. This long-standing registry includes over
11,000 mono- and di-zygotic twins in the United Kingdom. Subjects will be recruited from this group, with all
subjects completing questionnaires, having an ocular surface examination, and allowing a lid-margin swab to be
obtained. DNA and RNA will be extracted and subjected to state-of-the-art metagenomic sequencing, with
rigorous positive and negative controls. In the first aim, we will characterize the lid margin microbiome in this
cohort. A subset of subjects will be sampled bilaterally and a subset longitudinally to determine the consistency
and stability of findings. In the second aim, we will take advantage of the pre-existing large genomics database
on these subjects to determine the heritability of the periocular microbiome and attempt to identify the genetic
determinants of specific profiles. In the third aim, we will utilize both sampling of unrelated cohabitants as well
as extensive pre-existing demographic, nutritional, and environmental data on this cohort to attempt to identify
the environmental factors influencing the periocular microbiome.
At the conclusion of this study we anticipate having generated the definitive catalogue of lid margin flora
(including viruses and phage); and having established the genetic and environmental factors giving rise to
specific microbial communities. All data will be made publicly available. These data will inform future studies
on the relationship between ocular adnexal microbiome, eye disease, and specific interventions."

Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is associated with coronary artery diseases (CAD),
diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), ischemia with the non-obstructive coronary artery (INOCA), and
HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Patients with diabetes exhibit coronary
endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelial-dependent
relaxation. Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDD) decreases coronary blood flow
and myocardium perfusion, leading to myocardial ischemia without an obstructive coronary artery.
However, the underlying mechanism of impaired coronary endothelial dilation in DCM is not fully
understood. Our preliminary study finds that NO is the mediator of endothelium-dependent dilation
(EDD) in small coronary arteries in healthy mice. However, in diabetic mice, we observe that
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the principal endothelial-dependent vasodilator. Such a unique
preclinical diabetic model recapitulates a clinical observation of NO to H2O2 in CAD patients.
Moreover, we find a deficiency of miR-21 that restores the NO-dependent vasodilation in isolated
coronary arterioles of diet-induced diabetic mice. This application will address the functional
consequence of the miR-21-regulated NO to H2O2 switch in myocardial blood flow and cardiac
function and the underlying mechanism. We hypothesize that restoring “normal” coronary
microvascular function (restoring endothelial-dependent vasodilation) by modulating miR-21can
ameliorate diabetic cardiomyopathy (which is thought to be a disease related to impaired coronary
microvascular function). We will test our hypothesis by an interdisciplinary approach
encompassing a range of methods and disciplines from molecular and cell analyses and vascular
biology to physiology and pathophysiology, engendering the study of a novel mechanism of
coronary microvascular dysfunction, such as tissue-specific knockouts and lineage tracing with
3D fluorescent imaging, measurement of vasodilation and myocardial blood flow in vivo by
contrast echocardiography and cardiac function by echocardiography along with RNA-seq, sc
RNA-seq, etc. Completing this project may lead to a new strategy to treat microvascular
dysfunction and diabetic cardiomyopathy and improve the cardiovascular prognosis of diabetes."

 Acute optic neuritis (ON) is often the initial presenting manifestation of autoimmune
demyelinating disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Good recovery of vision after ON is common,
but a considerable number of MS patients experience poor outcomes with severe visual impairment
and permanent blindness as disease progresses. The increasing prevalence of MS will cause an
immense social and financial challenge for health care systems and more studies are needed to
improve treatment success in these diseases.
 Impaired recycling of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and decreased de novo synthesis of
cholesterol have been identified as key limiting factors of recovery in demyelinating animal models. We
have demonstrated decreased expression of the main cholesterol efflux transporter1, Abca1, and
altered cholesterol homeostasis in the retinogeniculate system of animals with Experimental
Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE)-ON. However, the exact mechanism by which changes in Abca1
expression affect cholesterol recycling remain elusive. We hypothesize that this impairment in
cholesterol synthesis and transport significantly affects RGC survival, integrity of synaptic plasticity and
remyelination and that restoration of cholesterol homeostasis via Abca1 regulatory feedback
ameliorates visual impairment.
 In specific aim 1, we will determine the regulatory influence of ABCA1 expression on sterol
synthesis and synaptic plasticity, cholesterol transport, and myelination in vitro. Eye and brain
organoids from healthy subjects and MS patients will be exposed to Abca1 inhibitors, TNFα/IFNγ, or
the demyelinating agent Lysolecithin. Effects of rescued Abca1 expression on sterol synthesis,
cholesterol uptake and transport, synaptogenesis and myelination will be examined using single-cell
RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and cholesterol efflux assays. In specific aim 2, we will
determine the molecular, functional, and structural impact of Abca1 expression changes in the
retinogeniculate pathway of EAE-ON and MS. EAE-ON will be induced in mice and effects of Abca1
expression changes will be determined using optokinetic response, optical coherence tomography,
pattern electroretinography, and visual evoked potentials, followed by postmortem molecular and
histopathologic analysis. Also, disruption in cholesterol homeostasis will be determined in MS donor
eye tissue.
 Our proposed experiments will significantly advance the understanding of the role of cholesterol
homeostasis in MS-like ON and provide an invaluable resource for future translational and therapeutic
studies."

Most cells of the body experience physiological and environmental stresses during their normal daily
functions that can lead to a ruptured cell cortex (plasma membrane and underlying cortical
cytoskeleton). The capacity of cells to rapidly repair general daily injuries, as well as ones resulting from
trauma, infection, or diseases/cancer, is essential for their survival. The general aim of this proposal is
to delineate how cells deal with such cell cortex disruptions to efficiently and effectively repair the
lesions. We have developed a robust inducible single cell repair model using the syncytial Drosophila
embryo that has superb amenability for live imaging and genetic tractability that is unavailable in other
cell wound repair models. Our repair model has allowed us to successfully employ global genetic
approaches for the first time to delineate the outline of cellular events and to identify many required
genes/gene families providing clear molecular entry points for investigating specific key steps in the
repair process. Our long-term goal is to establish the molecular framework underpinning cell wound
repair. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to determine the means by which the membrane plug
re-seals the torn plasma membrane then facilitates wound closure; 2) to determine how the actin ring
is attached to the overlying plasma membrane to coordinate their actions as the wound is pulled closed;
and 3) to elucidate the basis of cell cortex remodeling following wound closure. Our findings will impact
our understanding of cell wound repair across phyla, complement work done in other cell repair models,
provide new insights into key players/events needed for efficient repair, as well as how they work in
concert to achieve successful wound closure, and contribute to our understanding of related
fundamental cellular and developmental events. Our studies are also expected to be of significant
medical relevance, as understanding the molecules, machineries, and pathways governing cell wound
repair will be extremely valuable for developing new or enhancing existing strategies for treating cellular
damage, and for disciplines such as regenerative medicine where cell based constructs are used to
reconstruct tissues or clinical drug delivery systems where molecules cross cell membranes."

Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PS-VCID) are major contributors to Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD), occurring in 30% of stroke survivors. An individual’s complex life-course exposure
to vascular risk factors, along with the varying prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular risk factors among
the U.S. population, make study of the link between life-course exposure to cardiovascular risk factors and ADRD
a priority. Furthermore, the ability to accurately estimate an individual’s risk for PS-VCID at a particular timepoint
in life, even before a stroke occurs, is critical for planning personalized and public health interventions to improve
brain health and resilience. Risk factors such as obesity and dyslipidemia have gained epidemic proportions in
the U.S., but their causal role and contribution to PS-VCID risk are undefined. Further, PS-VCID risk prediction
tools using multimodal data and in multiple racial groups are not available. This proposal seeks to leverage FHS
data and resources to generate an understanding of PS-VCID trends and determinants, to collaborate with
REGARDS and ARIC study investigators to develop and validate in bi-racial participants comprehensive PS-
VCID risk prediction tools (including incorporation of a measure of social determinant of health), to study the
causal relations of obesity and dyslipidemia with PS-VCID, to explore repurposing of available drug treatments,
and to inform prevention strategies and treatment targets for PS-VCID. Specific Aims include: Aim 1, to describe
trends in PS-VCID risk in community dwelling individuals; Aim 2, to evaluate the life-course correlates of PS-
VCID using novel machine learning methods to exame the relation of repeated exposure measures, assessed
prospectively over seven decades, with PS-VCID, including i) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile components, ii)
lipid fractions, iii) obesity indicators, iv) hypertension types, and v) multi-organ disease; Aim 3, to develop two
PS-VCID risk prediction tools (PS-VCID risk scores) for i) clinical risk assessment (based on cardiovascular risk
factors, obesity measures, and dyslipidemia) and ii) use in research (with addition of brain imaging-derived
factors quantifying global cerebral small vessel disease burden, global gray matter volume and cortical thickness,
social factors (Area deprivation index) and genetic factors based on identification of the optimal polygenic risk
score for each vascular risk factor). Scores will be developed in the well-characterized FHS and REGARDS
cohorts, and then assessed and validated in the ARIC study. Aim 4, to study the causal relation of obesity and
dyslipidemia with PS-VCID and explore drug repurposing strategies in an instrumental variable analyses
framework."

Self-control failures are a universal challenge for healthy and clinical populations. Recent theoretical and
empirical work suggests these failures may arise from excessive cognitive costs associated with exercising
control. However, traditional self-control paradigms do not provide a methodological platform to quantify these
costs. Further, we know little about the neural basis of self-control costs nor how these representations change
under different classes of psychological stress, which is a major risk factor for self-control failure. To address
this, we developed a novel decision-making task that measures how much individuals will pay to restrict access
to tempting rewards that may derail their long-term goals and lead to self-control failure (precommitment). Here,
we aim to use an expanded and refined version of this newly validated tool to examine neurocomputational and
affective mechanisms underlying prospective self-control costs and how they relate to real-world self-control
failures. In Aim 1, we seek to identify the computational, motivational and cognitive mechanism that gives rise to
self-control costs. We will model the cost function for self-control, test how this metric relates to cognitive
constructs typically implicated in self-control in the literature and disentangle the motivational mechanism
underlying the use of precommitment. In Aim 2 we seek to characterize the neural correlates of self-control costs,
track how activity within these regions dynamically fluctuate depending on the feature of food stimuli participants
focus on and identify neural mediators and connectivity patterns stemming from these costs. In Aim 3, we seek
to examine how different classes of stressor type (physiological, social, or lifetime stress) shapes the behavioral
and neural representations of self-control costs. Characterizing individuals’ self-control cost function and how
these costs are represented in the brain will allow for a more direct test of how stress exposure affects decisions
to use self-control and may lead to potential interventions that can buffer individuals from the effects of stress on
such decisions."

Circadian clocks are present in most tissues of the body with importance for optimal physiological function and
behavior. Misalignment or disruption of peripheral circadian clocks contribute to disease and thus represent
promising novel treatment targets to improve health. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve our
understanding of peripheral circadian rhythms in humans. We will conduct a seven-weeklong
randomized, crossover, mechanistic clinical trial to 1) test zeitgebers (time cues) for peripheral circadian
rhythms, and 2) identify novel biomarkers for peripheral rhythms and explore zeitgebers for those rhythm in
humans. Preliminary data from our human circadian basic and clinical trial research set the stage for this
proposal. This mechanistic clinical trial effort is a first step to inform future development of novel circadian
based treatments for aligning peripheral clocks and for developing novel circadian biomarkers that will
advance our scientific understanding of circadian rhythms. Our overall goal and aims support the NIH
Precision Medicine Initiative and the NIH Sleep Research Strategic Plan."

The 8q24 genomic locus, containing the gene Tribbles pseudokinase 1 (TRIB1) has been repeatedly linked via
human genome-wide association study with multiple cardiometabolic parameters. This includes plasma total
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, coronary artery disease (CAD), circulating liver
enzymes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), circulating adiponectin, and HbA1c. This constellation
of genetic associations is unique in the genome, and suggests that TRIB1 is a critical regulator of human
metabolic health. Many of these traits are governed by hepatic metabolism, and knockout and overexpression
studies in mouse livers have demonstrated that Trib1 is a critical regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Despite
the genetic evidence supporting a role for this gene in human disease and early observations underscoring the
importance of hepatic Trib1, mechanistic studies of this gene have lagged. Prior work in myeloid cells has
established a model of TRIB1 function wherein it promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription
factor C/EBPα, but the mechanisms governing this function have not been explored in hepatocytes. Additionally,
while previous work demonstrated that hepatic overexpression of Trib1 reduces plasma lipids in mice, this
therapeutic paradigm has not been tested in preclinical models of cardiometabolic disease. Finally, the direction
of effect of TRIB1 in humans remains unknown, hampering the translational and therapeutic potential of this
gene and related pathways. We present here preliminary data demonstrating that hepatic TRIB1 does promote
COP1-dependent ubiquitination of the transcription factor C/EBPα, and this process requires a novel interaction
with a different pseudokinase, STK40. Additionally, we have established multiple in vivo animal models to test
the therapeutic potential of increased hepatic Trib1 activity in animal models of metabolic disease. Finally, we
have utilized whole exome sequencing in a highly novel consanguineous population to identify predicted loss-
of-function (pLoF) variants in TRIB1 that can help determine its function in humans. This experimental plan aims
to address the above outlined knowledge gaps through accomplishment of the following specific aims: 1) To
determine how hepatic TRIB1-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins is regulated by STK40; 2) To determine
the therapeutic benefit of Trib1 overexpression in animal models of CAD and NAFLD, and the requirement for
C/EBPα for such benefits; and 3) To determine the direction of effect and therapeutic potential for TRIB1 through
the identification and metabolic phenotyping of subjects harboring TRIB1 pLoF variants. Completion of these
aims will not only elucidate novel biology surrounding E3 ligases, pseudokinases, and the therapeutic potential
of TRIB1, but also further our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the myriad genetic associations
with the TRIB1 gene in humans. Our ultimate goal is an in depth understanding of the functions of hepatic TRIB1
with the hope that this can inform therapeutic strategies targeting dyslipidemia and resultant CAD, steatosis and
NAFLD, and metabolic syndrome in humans."

The majority of smokers try to quit each year, and the majority of quit attempts fail, even when the most effective
FDA-approved pharmacotherapies are used. Non-combustible tobacco products emit fewer harmful chemicals
than cigarettes, and thus for smokers who cannot quit smoking, switching completely to a less harmful product
is likely to improve their health. For smokers who have failed to quit with traditional methods, trying to switch to
a less harmful product may be more likely to help them stop smoking than trying to quit using tobacco altogether
repeatedly with pharmacotherapy. The proposed trial evaluates the potential of non-cigarette tobacco products
to serve as harm reduction tools for current smokers who have already tried, and failed, to quit with traditional
methods. Current smokers who failed to quit with FDA-approved pharmacotherapy within the past year (N=225)
will be randomly assigned to either 1) switch completely to a non-cigarette tobacco product (Switch Group,
n=150), or 2) try to quit again using pharmacotherapy (Meds Group, n=75). Participants will choose among a
limited menu of products or medications they would like to receive (maximizing external validity) and select a
Target Switch / Quit Date on which they will stop smoking. Participants in the Switch Group will choose between
two non-cigarette products that deliver sufficient nicotine and are appealing to adult smokers: e-cigarettes, the
most commonly used non-cigarette tobacco product, or heated tobacco products, a novel tobacco product
recently approved for sale by FDA as modified risk exposure compared to cigarettes. Both product classes, while
not safe, emit fewer harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes. Participants in the Meds Group will choose
between the two most effective pharmacotherapies available: varenicline or combination transdermal nicotine
replacement therapy and short-acting nicotine lozenge. Participants in the Switch or Meds groups will receive a
9-week supply; broken down as: 1-week to use ad libitum while continuing to smoke, and 8-weeks to use as
instructed following a Target Switch or Quit Date. The primary outcome is biochemically-confirmed abstinence
from cigarette smoking at the 6-month follow-up, and secondary outcomes include smoking reduction > 50%,
longest quit attempt duration, biomarkers of nicotine, smoke, and toxicant exposure, and changes in respiratory
symptoms. The proposed trial addresses a highly significant research question using a rigorous design and is
supported by a strong investigative team. The trial is in line with priorities within NOT-OD-22-023 including “Harm
reduction studies that involve switching from combustible cigarettes to ENDS [or heated tobacco products].”"

Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a heritable disease that bridges the gap between the
cardiomyopathies and the inherited arrhythmia syndromes. In its early “concealed” phase, ACM promotes the
incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of overt structural or mechanical remodeling. As the disease
progresses, myocyte loss, inflammation, and fibrofatty infiltration emerge, culminating in biventricular failure and
further risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The pathophysiological significance of the disease is underscored
by the fact that ACM is a leading cause of SCD in young individuals < 35 years of age. Mutations in desmosomal
proteins account for the majority (approx. 60%) of ACM cases, and in this project we focus on a form of ACM
known as Desmoplakin (DSP) cardiomyopathy (DSP-CM). DSP-CM has recently emerged as a unique clinical
entity that engenders a severe left-dominant form of the disease. DSP-CM is now well recognized to be a
heritable disease that is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, albeit with incomplete and highly variable
penetrance. Indeed, a major challenge in the field has been the lack of ability to distinguish whom amongst
carriers of pathogenic DSP variants are truly at risk of SCD and whom will go on to live healthy and symptom-
free lives. This issue takes on added urgency given that the prevention strategy for SCD in DSP-CM is exercise
restriction, a rather draconian measure for young healthy individuals, often athletes. The highly variable
penetrance associated with DSP-CM as well as the typical mode of SCD that these patients exhibit highlight the
importance of gene-environment interactions in unmasking disease pathogenicity. Our own recent work has
identified calpain-mediated desmoplakin degradation as a key factor linking DSP mutations with the development
of ACM and its exacerbation by exercise. Our central hypothesis is that: 1) calpain-mediated loss of myocyte
DSP protein is a key molecular event that is unmasked by exercise and β-adrenergic stimulation, and 2) the
pathogenic effects of DSP degradation at the intercalated disc (ID) are exacerbated by abnormal stretch-related
mechanotransduction leading to arrhythmias and heart failure. We will address this dual hypothesis using a multi-
scale approach encompassing complementary studies in human engineered heart tissues (hEHT) and
innovative genetic and surgical mouse models that are designed to address the complex interactions between
external stressors (increased preload) and genetic predisposition (DSP mutations) in the manifestation of DSP-
CM. Our studies will enable us to tease out contributions of separate aspects of endurance exercise to myocyte
dysfunction and expose pathophysiological mechanisms by which calpain vulnerability is unmasked by external
stressors to promote early onset arrhythmias and heart failure progression. Finally, we will test novel gene and
small molecule-based approaches to inhibit exercise-related calpain vulnerability while avoiding toxicity."

Despite continuing advances in medical genetics, medical imaging, and surgical interventions, thoracic aortic
aneurysms (TAAs) are increasingly responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Large clinical studies
reveal the complexity of the disease, which typically presents sporadically in older individuals, with uncontrolled
hypertension amongst the key risk factors, while also presenting in younger individuals having genetic or
congenital predispositions. Standard methods (including multivariate regressions) have failed to improve
prediction of life-threatening acute aortic syndromes (dissection and rupture) and current AHA/ACC guidelines
based on maximum aortic diameter fail to predict risk. Further complicating the situation, recent data show that,
although life-saving, surgical repair of the proximal aorta with a prosthetic graft increases incidence of distal
aortic disease and acute events, thus emphasizing the need to time surgery appropriately – that is, either
unnecessary delays due to adherence to current guidelines or pre-mature intervention may increase risk to
patients. There is a dire need for a better approach for predicting thoracic aortic growth and potential outcomes.
This proposal is significant for it is designed to resolve this unmet clinical need; it is innovative for we propose a
novel mechanobiological and biomechanical data-driven approach to develop a next-generation (neural operator
based) machine learning tool that can better predict TAA growth and certain outcomes, including drug efficacy.
We will combine a novel repurposing of extant murine and human data, generation of ~25000 new synthetic data
sets, and collection of unique new murine data (12 models of TAAs) to identify the best machine learning
approach, then combine extant and prospective clinical imaging data (~300 patients) to train and test the final
neural network (a deep operator neural network, or DeepONet). Our proposed unique meta-learning framework
is simply not possible with standard neural networks. We will exploit multi-fidelity training so that both low
resolution data and relatively inaccurate models can be used in training when combined with high-fidelity real or
synthetic data and uncertainty quantification via functional priors (the most informative Bayesian priors) that are
learned by combining historical data, biophysical models, and GANs (generative adversarial networks). This
unique combination allows us to learn posteriors with few samples (e.g., 2 or 3 new medical images), hence
predictions can be made for new cases with minimal (clinical) information. This project is possible given our
highly collaborative team of physician-scientists, bioengineers, and applied mathematicians having a strong track
record of successful research (grants, papers) and training of diverse students, post-docs, and residents."
10904664,"Transient plasma membrane disruptions (TPMD) are minor, quickly repairable plasma membrane tears that
result from normal stresses on cells within tissues. We hypothesize that keratocyte and cornea epithelial (CE)
TPMDs represent a novel cornea mechanosensation pathway, with TPMDs routinely occurring in keratocytes
and CE following mechanical stressors such as eye rubbing and application of contact lenses. We further
hypothesize that the resulting TPMD-induced Ca++ waves (TPMD-Ca++ Wvs) initiate signaling cascades that
coordinate specific activities of keratocytes and CE, including corneal matrix maintenance and cell actin
dynamics, respectively, which become disrupted in pathologies such as diabetes.
 The first Aim of this proposal is to identify the specific Ca++ channels responsible for keratocyte and CE
TPMD-Ca++ Wvs. The only Ca++ transporters identified to date in keratocytes are TRPV1 and TRPM8. We
determined that neither are significantly involved in TPMD-Ca++ Wvs, and our preliminary data indicate that L-
type Ca++ channels are likely involved. Identifying the specific Ca++ channels involved will allow us to determine
the signaling pathways triggering these Ca++ waves. Channel identification will be carried out by creating TPMDs
in individual mouse and human keratocytes and CE using a multiphoton microscope, either in culture or within
ex-vivo corneas, and pharmacological blockers and genetic knockdown of the identified channels will be utilized
to identify channel subtypes contributing to the TPMD-Ca++ Wvs.
 The second Aim is to identify the cell signaling pathways responsible for initiating and propagating TPMD-
Ca++ Wvs in keratocytes and CE in normal and diabetic corneas. We previously examined the general
contribution of several signaling pathways leading to keratocyte TPMD-Ca++Wvs, including ATP, release of
intracellular Ca++ stores, and gap junctions. This aim is designed to identify the specific signaling molecules
responsible for keratocyte and CE TPMD-Ca++Wvs. Pharmacological blockers and genetic knockdown of the
signaling molecules we have identified to date and their different receptor subtypes will be employed to
determine which specific receptors and signaling proteins are responsible for initiating and propagating
keratocyte and CE TPMD-Ca++ Wvs.
 Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that TPMD-Ca++ Wvs initiate Ca++-activated activities associated with cornea
matrix remodeling and CE actin dynamics, and that these are altered in diabetic corneas. Our preliminary data
indicate that keratocyte and CE TPMD-Ca++ Wvs influence cornea matrix and actin remodeling, respectively,
along with other physiological activities. We also find that diabetes alters TPMD responses. TPMDs will be
created by gentle manipulation of healthy and diabetic cells in culture and in diabetic mice. TPMD-Ca++ Wvs will
be blocked pharmacologically or with genetic knockdown, and matrix protein synthesis and CE actin remodeling
will be examined, along with additional activities including ATP release, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation."

 Surprisingly little is known about the regulation of B cell tolerance during infection; thus,
the overarching goal of our studies is to characterize autoantibodies in COVID-19, focusing on
their inflammatory capacity and abnormal regulation of B cell tolerance during infection. The scale
of the COVID-19 pandemic, synchrony between infection and autoimmune manifestations, and
mobilization of resources has allowed us to generate large numbers of banked samples paired
with well-annotated clinical data - creating a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study the
mechanisms involved in regulation of B cell tolerance and generation of IgG autoantibodies (AAb)
and pro-inflammatory immune complexes (IC). The pathogenic roles of AAb in COVID-19 are now
widely recognized with anti-cytokine antibodies targeting type I interferons identified in ~10% of
critically ill patients, and rare in those with milder disease. More than half of patients in our
COVID-19 cohorts have evidence of at least one AAb; the overwhelming majority of those who
are AAb positive during SARS-COV-2 infections have no known cause for autoimmunity. The
clinical correlates and immunologic basis of this loss of tolerance and aberrant AAb formation in
infection are as yet unexplored.
 Elucidating the role of Fc glycosylation and impairments in the establishment of B cell
tolerance in development of AAbs has not yet been attempted but may lead to a paradigm shift
in our understanding of the immune and autoimmune responses to both COVID-19 and viral
infection more broadly. Hence, in cohorts totaling >1300 patients with acute COVID-19 infection
and >3000 samples, we propose to test the hypothesis that patients with severe infections and
poor outcomes have pathogenic IgG AAb that may appear over the course of hospitalization and
become part of the antibody repertoire even in convalescence. We will also test whether IgG
AAbs in patients with severe COVID-19 have different Fc domain repertoires and glycosylation
that favor inflammation. Finally, we postulate that serum AAb in patients with COVID-19 result
from the activation of naïve self-reactive clones that escape early B cell tolerance checkpoints.
We will determine if naïve B cell selection defects are induced by infection or are likely already
present at the time of acute infection.
Hence, our work may ultimately inform the role of early immune-modulating interventions
not only in COVID-19, but in severe infections and ARDS more broadly, particularly pneumonia
in ICU settings."
10830403,"Summary
The goal of the proposed study is to better understand the role of antibodies in HEV infection and determine if
antibodies can prevent or cure chronic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. HEV infections are usually self-limited,
but the infections frequently persist when the immune system is compromised and if left untreated, can lead to
serious liver disease. HEV exists in two distinct virion forms: naked virions (nHEV) that are shed into feces and
mediate virus transmission between hosts, and quasi-enveloped HEV (eHEV) virions that circulate in the
bloodstream and mediate virus spread between cells. The eHEV particles lack viral antigens on their surface,
thus they are resistant to circulating HEV-specific antibodies. We previously show that eHEV particles enter cells
via a novel entry mechanism that involves lysosomal degradation of the viral envelope. Our recent data show
that HEV-specific IgG, but not IgM, effectively block eHEV-mediated spread in cell culture. Our central
hypothesis is that antibodies neutralize eHEV intracellularly by preventing virus uncoating in the
endosome/lysosome where the viral membrane degrades. Antibodies generated by natural HEV infection and
vaccination with truncated HEV capsid proteins (CP) are highly protective against HEV infection, while anti-HEV
antibody titers are usually low in patients with chronic HEV infection. Thus, antibodies may have the potential to
prevent or treat chronic HEV infection. Despite these encouragements, there are several significant roadblocks.
First, the C terminus of the HEV CP, which is not present in the current vaccine and the fecal virus, is intact in
the eHEV particles. This is important since structural modeling suggests that the presence of the C terminus of
CP significantly alters the surface structure of the virion which likely makes vaccine-induced antibodies less
effective against eHEV. Second, our recent work indicates that HEV produces a capsid decoy that is secreted
from infected cells in a large quantity and interferes with antibody-mediated neutralization. Third, antibody uptake
by hepatocytes is an inefficient process. Here we propose to overcome these obstacles. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that antibodies targeting virions with intact CP will block eHEV-mediated spread more efficiently. We
will determine the structure of authentic HEV virions with intact or cleaved CP and assess if antibodies targeting
virions with intact CP neutralize eHEV more efficiently. We will also determine if glycoengineered antibodies with
enhanced lysosomal targeting neutralize eHEV more efficiently. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that neutralizing
antibodies that do not bind or bind poorly to the decoy will block HEV spread more efficiently. We will also
determine the structure of the CP decoy in complex with antibodies by cryo-EM to gain a better understanding
of the evasion mechanism by the decoy. The completion of the proposed work will provide novel insights into
the role of antibodies in HEV infection and inform strategies to prevent or cure chronic HEV infection."

Extended deprivation of social contact can produce deleterious effects on the brain and behavior. Social isolation
(SI), or its perception (loneliness), is as predictive a risk factor for poor health outcomes as smoking or obesity.
Many factors have contributed to a modern epidemic of loneliness: a growing aging population, dramatic changes
to our social structure (technology, social media), the opioid crisis, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the most damaging impacts of SI is the promotion of interpersonal aggression and violence against others
– indeed, SI-associated domestic violence has risen by 20%, rates of suicide have surged, and school shootings
continue to rip at the fabric of society. Despite this, we have a poor understanding of the genetically-defined,
circuit mechanisms that give rise to isolation-induced aggression, representing a critical barrier for the
development of targeted interventions and cognitive therapies to treat pathological forms of aggression. One key
brain region known to exert top-down, cognitive control over behavior, including aggression, is the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the role of the mPFC in modulating the effects of SI-induced aggression is
unknown. In the project proposed here, we will interrogate the function of distinct, genetically-defined cells in the
mPFC to modulate SI-induced aggression. In support of this, we recently identified the neuropeptide Tachykinin
2 (Tac2)/Neurokinin B (NkB) as a key, subcortical mediator of SI. Here, we will test whether Tac2 signaling in
the mPFC exerts cortical control of SI-aggression. In preliminary studies, we have discovered that Tac2+ mPFC
neurons comprise a unique, unexplored class of GABAergic interneurons (INs). These findings lead to the
specific hypothesis that Tac2+ INs exert feed-forward inhibition of excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) to mediate
SI-aggression. To test this, we will combine behavior, machine learning, molecular-genetic loss- and gain-of
function manipulations, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging to achieve a circuit-level, mechanistic understanding of how
distinct populations of genetically-defined neurons in the mPFC exert coordinated, cortical control of SI-
aggression. We will determine whether mPFC Tac2+ neurons are required for SI-aggression (Aim 1), whether
mPFC PNs are sufficient to inhibit SI-aggression (Aim 2), and whether Tac2+ INs directly regulate PN activity
during SI-aggression (Aim 3). Collectively, we aim to uncover a conserved, genetically-defined mPFC
microcircuit for the top-down, cortical control of isolation-induced aggression. These findings will transform the
field by expanding our understanding of how pathological forms of aggression are encoded and controlled by
prefrontal circuits in the brain. Importantly, this research will have profound implications for the treatment of social
isolation-related mental health disorders, particularly those that result in violence."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor disease with a median overall survival of approximately 15
months. GBM patients die because of the constant ability of GBM to acquire resistance mechanisms against
anti-cancer therapies, therefore leading to an inevitable tumor recurrence.
Radiation therapy (RT) is a pivotal modality for improving overall survival of GBM. However, GBM invariably
recurs, which suggests that RT is eliciting or exacerbating mechanisms of resistance in GBM. Identifying and
overcoming the contributing factors involved in GBM resistance is a major challenge in Radiation
Oncology. GBM metabolism and its role in immune evasion emerges as a RT-induced resistance mechanism
in GBM. Specifically, we have preliminary data indicating that irradiated GBM cells reprogram their metabolism
towards the generation of fatty acids. Such metabolic reprogramming after RT is impairing the innate immune
recognition and systemic anti-tumor immunity elicited by RT. More precisely, we have preliminary evidence that
fatty acid synthesis is inhibiting nucleic acid sensing-dependent interferon type I (IFN-I) responses and is
promoting immunosuppressive signals such as the programmed-death-1 (PD-1) and the programmed-death
ligand 1 (PD-L1). As a consequence, cancer cell-intrinsic IFN-I will not be released in response to RT. This
ultimately limits anti-tumor immune response against GBM by precluding infiltration effector T cells into the GBM
microenvironment. We have recently demonstrated that cancer cell-intrinsic IFN-I response is an essential step
to convey immunogenicity of an irradiated tumor. Consequently, by increasing energy supply, limiting innate
immunity and increasing immunosuppression, RT-induced fatty acid synthesis is likely to be a major GBM
resistance mechanism that not only impacts RT response of GBM but also provides means to evade immune
recognition. In this application, we propose to test the novel and innovative hypothesis that fatty acid
metabolism induced by RT controls immune escape and GBM survival. Successful completion of this
proposal will define how fatty acid synthesis facilitates GBM immune evasion and provide pre-clinical
evidence for fatty acid inhibitors as a novel approach to restore the immunogenicity of irradiated GBM."

Background: Seventy million children globally are estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb), the bacteria which causes tuberculosis (TB). Of these, 1 million develop TB disease each year with a
quarter of them dying. Young children and those living with HIV are at high risk of progressing from Mtb infection
to TB disease and of developing severe forms of TB. They therefore represent a key population to target with
TB preventive therapy (TPT). Providing TPT to all children exposed to TB, especially in settings with high TB
burden, results in substantial overtreatment, with associated costs and toxicity. Yet the current tests of Mtb
infection are inadequate to predict future progression to disease in children. Developing new tests that accurately
predict which TB-exposed children will progress to TB, is a critical priority and will allow for more targeted
approaches to TB prevention. The identification of Mtb biomarkers in children should also consider relevant other
factors, including age, and exposure to other common pathogens. Several common viruses have been shown
to influence the risk of developing TB and are likely to affect biomarker signatures, yet few studies have evaluated
the influence of viruses on childhood TB biomarkers. Finally, current tests of Mtb infection indicate immunological
sensitization to Mtb rather than viable bacilli. If it were possible to identify a biosignature associated with Mtb
death, this could provide an additional strategy for targeted TPT approaches in young children. Our group has
an extensive track record of translational clinical research into pediatric TB. Our team consists of world leaders
in the fields of clinical pediatrics, epidemiology, immunology, proteomics, transcriptomics, and bioinformatics.
Methods: We will use samples from our three rigorously conducted studies in children <5 years, a drug-resistant
TB preventive therapy trial, an observational household contact study, and a prospective diagnostic study, all
conducted in a setting with high burden of TB and HIV. We will carry out a cross-sectional analysis to explore
differences in biosignatures along the TB disease spectrum, nested case-control studies in longitudinal cohorts
to evaluate risks of progression to Mtb infection and TB disease, and studies to evaluate changes in signatures
on treatment for Mtb infection and early disease. We will use proteomic (SomaScan), transcriptomic (RNA-seq),
metabolomic (mass spectrometry) and antibody (Systems Serology) approaches, and use a training/test design,
to identify biomarker signatures. We will examine biosignatures in the context of clinical co-variates and viral
exposure (PepSeq and RNA-seq). Finally, we will integrate the different approaches to generate the most robust
biomarker combinations and provide the most granular insight into the biology of TB disease progression.
Impact: Identifying novel biomarkers of TB disease progression in young children, including those living with
HIV, would transform the global response to pediatric TB. For the first time, it would be possible to prevent TB
by identifying and effectively treating children at the highest risk of future disease. This would have a substantial
impact on overall morbidity and mortality."

 Efficient wound healing requires complex cellular communication between tissue-resident
non-immune cells and infiltrating immune cells. While much has been learned about how
cytokines and growth factors contribute to acute wound healing, we know very little about how
lipid signaling regulates acute inflammation and tissue repair, and identification of new
mechanisms that govern acute inflammation and repair is needed. We previously demonstrated
that inhibiting dermal adipocyte lipolysis led to reduced macrophage numbers during early
inflammation and delayed repair, yet the mechanism(s) linking adipocyte lipolysis to efficient
inflammation and repair have not been identified. Given the rising numbers of diabetic and aged
patients, it is imperative to define molecular underpinnings that promote a healthy acute
inflammatory response and to identify druggable mechanisms to treat inflammation and non-
healing wounds.
 Inhibition of injury-induced dermal adipocyte lipolysis significantly reduces the abundance
of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Recently, GPR84 was identified to be an MCFA receptor
that is expressed by bone marrow-derived myeloid cells and during tissue inflammation. Activation
of GPR84 in vitro increases macrophage migration and enhances pro-inflammatory gene
expression; however, its role in skin and the in vivo mechanism of action is not well defined. We
observe increased GPR84-expression during wound-induced inflammation and found that
administration of a GPR84 agonist increases macrophage numbers. Additionally, systemic
administration of a GPR84 antagonist decreases wound bed macrophages and delays tissue
repair. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that GPR84 signaling is required to support
macrophage numbers and subsequent repair during injury-induced inflammation. We will
combine our team’s tools and expertise in adipocyte, keratinocyte, and macrophage biology with
single-cell data interrogation to validate this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: (1) Use
mouse models to determine how GPR84 signaling controls macrophage numbers and
subsequent tissue repair after injury, and (2) define how MCFA/GPR84 signaling directly
regulates myeloid cell function during skin wound healing and (3) define how epithelial GPR84
signaling contributes to keratinocyte function after injury.
 GPR84 signaling represents a new window to better understand mechanisms that regulate
the injury response. Findings from this proposed work could lay a solid foundation for developing
new tools that predict and enhance therapeutic treatment of wound healing."

 This proposal concerns the development of new reagents and strategies for the
preparation of basic, aromatic, nitrogenous heterocycles through single-atom insertion
reactions. The medicinal importance of such structures (pyridines, pyrimidines,
pyridazines) is difficult to overstate – of the thirty new small molecule drugs approved in
2019, ten of them contain one or more of these motifs and their prevalence among
medicinally-relevant compounds is a long-standing trend. This privileged status has
prompted the development of a variety of synthetic strategies for their preparation, which
can largely be subdivided into de novo assembly of the heteroaromatic nucleus (typically
condensations), and attachment of preformed heteroarenes via cross-coupling and
nucleophilic aromatic substitution approaches. These strategies have enabled the
proliferation of such compounds for wide-ranging medicinal applications, but their
implementation is nonetheless far from trivial, necessitating the continuing development
of novel strategies.
 A conceptual mid-point exists between de novo synthesis and attachment wherein
one heterocyclic structure is converted into another. Such an approach has limited
historical precedent but holds substantial promise due to the orthogonal reactivity
preferences (e.g. nucleophilic vs. electrophilic) and reaction compatibility of 5- vs. 6-
membered heterocycles. We propose herein a set of reagents which will enable such
transformations to be realized in a synthetically straightforward manner.
 Our focus on single-atom changes is calculated: rearrangement reactions, though
lauded, are rarely employed in synthesis due to their retrosynthetic complexity. By
developing transformations that are easy to recognize in a retrosynthetic sense (e.g.
“remove this nitrogen atom”) we hope to provide user-friendly tools for medicinal chemists
to employ. Moreover, the ability to transform pyrroles, pyrazoles, and imidazoles into a
variety of 6-membered ring heterocycles feeds naturally into late-stage skeletal editing of
pharmaceuticals, allowing diversification of bioactive scaffolds for more efficient structure-
activity relationship determination and for site-specific isotopic labeling. As such,
successful realization of the goals enumerated herein will advance the ability for chemists
to interrogate biological function of heteroaromatic compounds by affording a powerful
new set of tools for their synthesis."
10875623,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Well controlled antiviral innate immunity is essential for restricting viral pathogens while preventing aberrant
inflammation. A key antiviral signaling pathway is initiated by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) which sense viral RNA
in the cytosol to induce the production of interferons through a higher order signaling platform centered on the
adaptor protein MAVS. Although the components of the MAVS signalosome are basally expressed, RLR
signaling only proceeds when they coalesce around MAVS at ER-mitochondrial contact sites. Many of the
protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications required for the proper function of the MAVS
signalosome are known. While, functional interactions in protein complexes can be mediated by RNA molecules,
whether RNA molecules play a role in signaling through the MAVS signalosome remains unexplored. I have
found that 1) MAVS is associated with non-viral RNA, that 2) RNA promotes signaling through the MAVS
signalosome, and that 3) canonical RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with MAVS. This proposal aims to
define the functional roles for RNA and RBPs in regulating antiviral signaling through the MAVS signalosome.
During the mentored phase, I will gain new training in the characterization of RNA-protein interactions through
biochemical, sequencing-based, and quantitative proteomic approaches, as well as the virological techniques
required to study RNA viruses and innate immunity. In Aim 1, I will define the RNA-dependent interactions
between components of the MAVS signalosome during the K99 phase, and identify novel proteins that associate
with RNA during RLR signaling at the R00 phase. Through Aim 2, I will pinpoint the sequences in MAVS required
for RNA-association, and identify a high-confidence set of MAVS-bound RNAs during the K99 phase. During the
R00 stage, I will functionally dissect the roles for these RNAs at the MAVS signalosome. In Aim 3, I will screen
a shortlist of MAVS-associated RBPs to identify those that influence MAVS signaling during the K99 stage, and
determine the molecular functions of three RBPs (STAU1, HNRNPL, and RBM10) in antiviral signaling at the
R00 stage. The overall outcome of these experiments will be to define new RNA-centric principles by which the
MAVS signalosome is organized. Understanding how RNA molecules influence antiviral signaling could unlock
new host-directed therapeutic strategies against viral diseases as well as autoimmune disorders. In addition to
my advisor Dr. Savan, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with expertise in the different facets of my
research. Together, this excellent training environment at the University of Washington will augment my research
during the mentored phase, and equip me with the skills required to transition to an independent academic
researcher studying the RNA regulation of innate immune processes."

Generalized approaches for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), a prevalent and heterogeneous syndrome in
which laryngeal symptoms are attributed to gastroesophageal reflux, have led to poor health outcomes,
inappropriate resource utilization, and tremendous healthcare costs. The long-term career goal is to discover
phenotype guided care paradigms for LPR, focused on distinct disease mechanism. Our preliminary findings
have generated the central hypothesis that identification of distinct LPR phenotypes is feasible and that
psychological processes such as hypervigilance and anxiety impact symptom burden in LPR. Thus, the overall
objectives in this proposal are to establish a validated method to measure levels of hypervigilance and anxiety
surrounding laryngeal symptoms and understand whether distinct LPR phenotypes report differing levels of
hypervigilance and anxiety. The rationale for this project is that it will highlight the impact of cognitive-affective
processes on LPR symptom burden and generate hypotheses surrounding the role of behavioral interventions
in LPR. Thus, two specific aims will be pursued: 1) validate the laryngeal hypervigilance and anxiety scale
[LHAS] self-report instrument, and 2) measure levels of hypervigilance and anxiety across distinct LPR
phenotypes. Under the first aim, 200 symptomatic patients and 40 healthy volunteers will complete the LHAS
and a set of validated instruments measuring psychological distress and health related quality of life.
Psychometric properties of the LHAS will be assessed and a preliminary cutoff for the LHAS will be
determined. Under the second aim, the 200 symptomatic patients will be categorized into LPR phenotypes
utilizing our prior model from discriminant analysis of principal components. Levels of laryngeal hypervigilance
and anxiety will be measured and compared across LPR phenotypes, as well as the healthy volunteers. The
proposed research is significant as it is expected to fill a key evidence gap about the interplay of
psychological stressors on LPR symptom burden. This research is innovative as it will provide a novel clinical
tool to evaluate cognitive affective processes in patients with LPR as well as inform the framework of a first-of-
its-kind phenotype stratified randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy of behavioral interventions compared
to traditional anti-reflux therapy such as proton pump inhibitors in patients with LPR."

This is an application for a new Postdoctoral Training Program in Genomic Medicine (T32). We propose two
postgraduate positions per year to support physician-scientists who are engaging in medical genetics research.
There are too few medical geneticists to meet the growing need for our services. As a result, much of medical
genetics testing, diagnosis, counseling, and management occurs outside of our field and is instead practiced
by physicians who receive little specific training. Our goals are therefore twofold: first, to mentor future medical
geneticists who are embarking on a career in academic medicine and therefore grow the medical genetics
workforce; and secondly, to provide medical genetics training to physician-scientists in other fields who engage
in medical genetics-related research, which will enhance the clinical knowledge-base of those specialists who
may be most likely to use genetic testing or treatments in their practices. The specific aims of this proposal
include: 1) protected mentored research experiences with well-established investigators performing research in
medical genetics within the Washington University School of Medicine, 2) obligatory educational programs in
laboratory management, scientific rigor, statistics, grantsmanship, responsible conduct of research, and
biomedical informatics 3) individualized specific coursework based on the trainees’ areas of investigation, 4)
continuous feedback to the trainees, mentors and program leadership, and 5) the development of trainees with
disabilities, disadvantaged backgrounds, and underrepresented minorities. Trainees may choose from four
focus areas, which represent patient care needs with particularly rapid growth: Cancer, Rare and Undiagnosed
Diseases, Gene-Environment Interaction, and Neurodegeneration. The program director, Patricia Dickson, will
work closely with co-director Jorge Di Paola to select and oversee training of future leaders in genomic
medicine. Major strengths of this program include active medical and laboratory genetics training programs, in-
house clinical cytogenetics laboratory, biochemical laboratory, and sequencing capability, a large number of
centers and groups performing genomic studies, including Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical and model
organism screening center sites, the McDonnell Genome Institute, the Cancer Atlas Network, the Edison
Family Center for Genome Sciences & Systems Biology, and others. Washington University provides an
outstanding mentorship environment and infrastructure for genetics research, with an emphasis on
collaboration and a superb track record of producing physician-scientists. This proposal will take advantage of
the wealth of genetics research, clinical and research training, and mentorship that is thriving on our campus to
train those scientists who will bring innovative diagnostics, therapeutics, and data-driven practice to the clinic."

Purpose in life is the belief that one’s life and activities are goal-oriented, directed, and worthwhile. This belief is
associated consistently with better outcomes, including greater engagement in health promoting behavior (e.g.,
less smoking, more physical activity), fewer chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes), and
ultimately greater longevity. Independent of behavioral and clinical factors, purpose in life is associated with
better cognitive outcomes, including lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). ADRD
remains a significant challenge to patients, their families, and the healthcare system, as it is one of the leading
causes of death that lacks disease-modifying treatments or cures. There is a growing literature that shows that
purpose in life is protective across the arc of the ADRD disease spectrum: It is associated with better
performance on cognitive tasks and less cognitive decline prior to dementia onset, it is protective against
cognitive impairments, both mild and severe, and, even after diagnosis, it is associated with fewer behavioral
and psychological symptoms of dementia. In a parallel literature, there is consistent evidence from randomized
controlled trials that purpose in life is malleable and can be increased through intervention. Purpose in life is thus
poised to be a powerful target of intervention to improve cognitive outcomes, from maintaining cognitive function
in middle adulthood to improving outcomes in dementia care. The next step in intervention development is to
identify the putative mechanisms of action hypothesized to change in response to the intervention and explain
the relation between purpose and better cognitive outcomes. Once these mechanisms are identified,
interventions that increase purpose to improve cognitive outcomes can be developed and tested. As a step
toward this long-term goal, the present study will use ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to identify the
daily mechanisms responsible for the association between purpose in life and healthier cognitive outcomes. In
particular, we will test the hypothesis that purpose in life is associated with greater momentary engagement and
better momentary cognition, which will support healthier cognitive function over time. We will address these
associations in three groups considered critical populations for intervention: older adults with subjective cognitive
impairment, older adults with healthy cognition, and middle-aged adults. This research will provide much needed
information on putative mechanisms of action that explain how purpose protects cognition. Such information is
critical to develop purpose interventions that promote healthier cognitive aging."

It is well known that prior to the establishment of adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), the chromatin in
male germ cells (MGCs) undergoes extensive epigenetic reprogramming during a long period of mitotic arrest
(G0). However, a number of critical questions about this process remain unanswered. Do all MGCs undergo
similar reprogramming or is the process selective for a specific sub-population that will give rise to the SSCs?
How do changes in methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure silence developmental
pathways and stabilize SSC fate? Do these changes depend on cell cycle arrest? Here, we propose to
address these important questions through the lens of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) dead end 1 (DND1).
DND1 is essential to maintain MGC identity since loss of Dnd1 function results in trans-differentiation of germ
cells to somatic fates or disruption of G0 and formation of teratomas. We recently developed a transgenic
mouse line in which a functional fusion protein between DND1 and GFP is expressed from the endogenous
locus (Dnd1GFP). This reporter distinguishes two MGC populations during G0: DND1-lo cells and DND1-hi
cells, which represent only 5-12% of the population. RNA-seq revealed that Dnd1 transcript levels as well as
transcript levels for multiple epigenetic regulators are 5-10 fold higher in DND1-GFP-hi cells. Furthermore,
RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) using antibodies against DND1-GFP identified multiple epigenetic regulators
that are targets of DND1 during G0. Among these targets are DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), the enzyme
Setdb1, that imposes the nuclear lamina associated repressive histone mark (H3K9me3), five Tudor domain
proteins (Tdrds), and four actin dependent regulators (Smarcs) that function in association with a matrix
scaffold. We hypothesize (1) that in DND1-hi cells, DND1 controls the post-transcriptional regulation
of epigenetic modifiers by stabilizing their transcripts and gating translation and (2) that many of
these epigenetic regulators function in association with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) dependent
upon maintenance of GO. This project will test the significance of heterogeneity among MGCs, the critical
function of the RBP, DND1 in epigenetic reprogramming, and the role of cell cycle arrest. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether DND1-hi cells represent a clonal or transient population, and whether transcripts of
epigenetic regulators are protected and differentially translated in DND1-hi or DND1-lo cells. In Aim 2, we will
map epigenetic changes over time, and determine whether they differ in DND1-hi and DND1-lo cells. In Aim
3, we will determine whether chromatin domains undergoing change are localized to the nuclear lamins, and
whether changes are disrupted by blocking association with lamins or disrupting cell cycle arrest. This project
will address the significance of heterogeneity among MGCs and the role of cell cycle arrest and the nuclear
lamins. We expect these results will uncover vulnerabilities to physiological, disease-related, or environmental
conditions that alter epigenetic mechanisms and affect gametogenesis and male fertility."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United
States, with a five-year survival rate of 7-8%. This poor survivability can be partially attributed to late detection,
however PDAC therapies have remained stagnant which amplifies the discordance between the survivability of
PDAC and other cancers. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of certain malig-
nancies, but most carcinomas, including PDAC, remain refractory. The Fearon Lab has identified that the chem-
okine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) “coats” cancer cells in mouse models of PDAC, and that blocking the
interaction between CXCL12 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4, the CXCL12 receptor, results in T cell
influx into cancer cell nests and response to ICB. Additionally, we find that CXCL12 is covalently linked to keratin
19 (KRT19) on the surface of cancer cells by the isopeptide bond forming enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TGM2),
and knockout of either Krt19 or Tgm2 results in T cell entry into cancer cell nests and response to ICB. This data
indicates that the CXCL12-KRT19 conjugate is a primary mediator of tumor immune suppression, however, our
understanding of the biochemical process of its formation, and kinetics of its formation and disassembly, are
lacking yet would provide insight for future studies attempting to regulate these processes. Therefore, I will de-
termine the glutamine of KRT19 required to covalently bond to CXCL12 in vivo and determine if its mutation
results in loss of CXCL12 coating and response to ICB. Additionally, I will quantify the rate of formation and
disassembly of the CXCL12 coat and characterize the accompanying changes to immune cell activity.
In Aim 1 I will generate the CXCL12-KRT19 conjugate using TGM2 in vitro and subject this complex to mass
spectrometry analysis to identify the crosslinked residues between CXCL12 and KRT19. I will generate recom-
binant KRT19 containing a Q to N mutation of the residue found to be crosslinked to CXCL12 and validate that
CXCL12 can no longer be linked to KRT19. I will then express the mutant KRT19 in mouse PDA 1242 cells and
validate that CXCL12 fails to become linked to cancer cells in vivo and determine if this failure results in suscep-
tibility to ICB. In Aim 2 I will inject Matrigel suspensions of 1242 cells into C57BL/6J mice to facilitate early tumor
harvesting and quantification of the rate of formation of the CXCL12 coat using immunofluorescent tissue stain-
ing. I will use a Doxycycline-Off KRT19 expression system to study the rate of CXCL12 coat disassembly and
perform immune cell profiling using RNA sequencing to determine how infiltrative T cells respond to coat disas-
sembly. This proposal will study how the CXCL12 coat forms, the rate of its formation and disassembly, and
highlight that modulating the CXCL12 coat reciprocally modifies anti-tumor immune activity. Additionally. this
fellowship will provide training for my longitudinal goal of studying translational tumor immunology through in-lab
training, workshops, meetings, and clinical work at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Stony Brook University."

While motor vehicle crash risk is 2-6 times higher for all drivers engaging in cellphone use, cellphone use while
driving is most prevalent among young drivers (18-24 years). Young drivers have both the highest phone use
while driving and the highest crash rate per capita among all ages, but they are understudied. Technological
solutions, including cellphone-blocking apps and driving mode (e.g., Apple’s “Do Not Disturb While Driving”),
may be promising, but research on effectiveness remains sparse. Our pilot R21 found that a commercial app is
effective in reducing cellphone use while driving, but had insufficient power to examine high-risk driving events.
Few studies have examined driving mode or compared driving mode with a commercial app in reducing phone
use and high-risk driving events. Therefore, we propose an R01 with objective to conduct a randomized
controlled trial to determine the effects of a cellphone app and a driving mode intervention in reducing
cellphone use and high-risk driving events in drivers aged 18-24 years. We hypothesize that cellphone use and
high-risk driving events can be substantially reduced if a cellphone app or driving mode is active. We also
hypothesize that the driving mode is as effective as the app. The aims of this project are to estimate the effects
of the phone app and driving mode interventions in reducing calling, texting, and handheld phone use (Primary
Aim 1), determine the effects of the phone app and driving mode interventions in reducing high-risk driving
events (Primary Aim 2), and pilot test the feasibility of tracking traffic violations and crashes using existing
databases (Exploratory Aim 3). A prospective, randomized, parallel-group, three-arm trial will be conducted. A
total of 1,200 young drivers will be randomized to receive: (1) a commercial app (active FleetSafer) that blocks
handheld phone use while driving, but allows emergency calls and phone use after pressing the passenger
button; (2) a driving mode (provided by the cellphone manufacturer or service provider) that blocks handheld
phone use while driving, but allows emergency calls and manual override or (3) an inactive FleetSafer app that
permits and tracks calls and texts (controls). Participants will be studied for six months (month 1: baseline,
month 2-6: intervention). The outcomes will include: (1) calling and texting while driving tracked by FleetSafer,
and (2) handheld phone use while driving and high-risk driving events captured by a video camera. We will
estimate the effectiveness of the app and driving mode interventions in reducing calling, texting, and high-risk
driving events. Guided by our preliminary R21, this study is innovative as we focus on novel technological
approaches to address the epidemic of cellphone-related distracted driving. We will employ proven video
capture methods to identify high-risk driving events and assess the contribution of cellphone use. This study is
significant, because the findings will provide information regarding the effectiveness of cellphone-blocking apps
and driving modes in reducing cellphone use and high-risk driving behaviors in teens and young adults."

In multicellular organisms including animals, plants and human beings, stem cells play conserved roles in
maintaining themselves undifferentiated but continuously dividing to sustain organ development and body
formation. Defects in stem cell function lead to abnormal organ development and diseases. On the other side,
unraveling stem cell behavior and regulation can provide effective cell-based therapies including tissue
regeneration for human diseases such as neurodegeneration, diabetes, and heart disease. To date, the
regulatory mechanisms controlling the initiation, proliferation and termination of stem cell niches are still not fully
understood. Here, we propose to determine the cellular and molecular basis underlying stem cell homeostasis
using the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM) as a model system. Because undifferentiated stem cells in
Arabidopsis SAMs are at and near the surface and the living SAMs can maintain sessile during experiments,
non-invasive time-lapse live imaging approaches are particularly effective in Arabidopsis, to follow the fate of
each stem cell and their derivatives and to quantify cell dynamics in vivo. In addition, great genetic resources in
Arabidopsis allow us to quantitatively dissect gene function through using an existing array of mutants with
changed SAM sizes and stem cell numbers. Using this system, through a combination of in vivo time-lapse
confocal imaging, transient and stable perturbations of gene function, in vitro biochemistry and in silico
quantification and modeling approaches, we aim to uncover mechanisms by which a small group of key
transcriptional regulators that are excluded from stem cells but determine the identity and activity of the stem
cells in the SAMs. Our work will not only define the yet missing molecular linkage and cell-cell communication
between differentiated and undifferentiated cells, but also elucidate a regulatory network underlying a cell non-
autonomous phenomenon in control of stem cell homeostasis."

Manual behavior requires sensory signals from the hand, both tactile and proprioceptive, as evidenced by the
severe deficits that result from somatosensory deafferentation. Three aspects of the sensory component of hand
sensory function are poorly understood. First, the neural basis of touch has been studied almost exclusively with
stimuli delivered passively to the skin, precluding any understanding of how tactile signals are modulated by and
interact with motor commands. Second, proprioceptive signals carry information not only about the time-varying
conformation of the hand, but also about manually applied forces, but proprioceptive representations of force
are poorly understood. Third, stereognosis – the sense of the three-dimensional shape of objects acquired from
sensory signals arising from the hand – implies the integration of tactile and proprioceptive signals, a process
about which little is known. The study of active touch, hand proprioception, and stereognosis has been hindered
by technical obstacles. Indeed, characterizing self-generated contact with objects has been difficult or
impossible, as has tracking hand movements with sufficient precision. To overcome these obstacles, my team
has developed an apparatus that allows us to measure contact events – with a sensor sheet covering the object’s
surface – and track time-varying hand postures – using deep learning-based computer vision – with
unprecedented precision as animals interact with objects. We then characterize the responses at every stage
along the somatosensory neuraxis, from peripheral nerve through cortex. This novel experimental set up will
allow us to study the neural basis of somatosensation – particularly as it relates to manual dexterity – under
ecologically valid conditions.
In a related line of inquiry, we leverage what we learn about sensory processing to restore the sense of touch to
bionic hands. In brief, we develop algorithms to convert the output of sensors on the bionic hand into patterns of
electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve (for amputees) or of somatosensory cortex (for people with
tetraplegia) to evoke meaningful tactile percepts. I am one of the principal architects of the biomimetic approach
to artificial touch, which posits that encoding algorithms that mimic natural neural signals will give rise to more
intuitive tactile percepts, thereby endowing bionic hands with greater dexterity. Our work on artificial touch
comprises three components: evaluation of the perceptual correlates of electrical stimulation, development of
sensory encoding algorithms, and assessment of the benefits of artificial touch to manual behavior. The interplay
of the basic scientific results and neural engineering efforts will result in more naturalistic artificial touch for brain-
controlled bionic hands."

10914014,"ABSTRACT: This research aims to optimize speech-understanding and spatial-hearing outcomes for cochlear-
implant (CI) users, specifically bilateral (BI-CI) and single-sided-deafness (SSD-CI) users. The gap in knowledge
is that it is unknown what causes contralateral disruption, how it affects speech understanding and binaural
benefits, and how it might be remediated. The long-term goal of our research program is to optimize hearing
performance for CI users with two inputs. The overall objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms
underlying functional consequences of asymmetry, specifically through two phenomena that are manifestations
of contralateral disruption: “bilateral speech interference” (speech presented in one ear impedes speech under-
standing in the other, usually the better ear interfering with the poorer) and “interaural loudness mismatch” (bi-
lateral stimuli that are equally loud when presented sequentially produce a distorted spatial map when presented
simultaneously). Our overarching functional hypothesis is that asymmetric hearing, manifesting in contralateral
disruption, is a major factor stunting real-world CI performance. Our overarching mechanistic hypothesis is that
the two phenomena stem from asymmetric peripheral distortion, central auditory maladaptive plasticity, or both.
We will test our overarching hypotheses through three specific aims: (1) Measure the consequences of contra-
lateral disruption (bilateral speech interference and interaural loudness mismatch) from interaural asymmetry for
increasingly realistic situations; (2) Determine the extent to which peripheral asymmetry explains contralateral
disruption; (3) Determine if contralateral disruption is influenced by central auditory plasticity. These aims will
yield the following expected outcomes: (1) identify the situations, prevalence, and magnitude where BI-CI and
SSD-CI spatial-hearing outcomes are limited by contralateral disruption; (2) extend objective techniques—pre-
viously applied to understand monaural CI performance—to characterize the link between peripheral neural sur-
vival and binaural processing; (3) determine if abnormal across-ear processing is susceptible to central plasticity.
This contribution is significant because contralateral disruption, viewed through the two asymmetry phenomena
of bilateral speech interference and interaural loudness mismatch, is a major roadblock to good binaural hearing.
Understanding the causes and negative consequences of contralateral disruption will provide tools to optimize
rehabilitation for the 30-50% of BI-CI and nearly 100% of SSD-CI users with asymmetric hearing. The work is
innovative because (1) it seeks to understand the roadblock in hearing outcomes based on asymmetry effects,
rather than optimizing each ear individually, (2) it compares BI-CI and SSD-CI users to distinguish the mecha-
nisms underlying contralateral disruption, and (3) it pairs perceptual and objective measures to differentiate be-
tween peripheral and central contributions to poor hearing outcomes in asymmetric cases."

This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Lindsay Keegan, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the
University of Utah. Dr. Keegan is establishing herself as a young investigator in infectious disease dynamics
addressing public health relevant questions on the spread and control of infectious diseases. This K01 award
will provide the support necessary to accomplish the following goals to develop: (1) expertise in genomic
methods as it relates to epidemiology; (2) expertise in biostatistics particularly probability theory, network
models, and Bayesian statistics; (3) expertise in healthcare epidemiology as it relates to pathogen transmission
within healthcare facilities (HCF); and (4) and strengthen research leadership and management skills. To
achieve these goals, Dr. Keegan has assembled a mentoring team comprised of: Dr. Matthew Samore
(primary mentor), a healthcare epidemiologist and expert in mathematical modeling of healthcare associated
infections; and Dr. Marc Lipsitch (co-mentor), an epidemiologist and a recognized leader in mathematical
modeling of infectious diseases including modeling healthcare associated infections, and Dr. Michael Rubin
(co-mentor), and infectious disease physician and an expert on translational science to support antimicrobial
stewardship and infection prevention and leadership. Dr. Keegan has also assembled a team of four advisors
with expertise in biostatistics, genomic epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and hospital epidemiology.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria pose a significant public health threat, causing over 2.8 million infections and over
35,000 deaths each year in the United States. The burden of these infections is concentrated within HCFs; and
how to control these pathogens remains the source of considerable debate. Based on data collected from a
prior CDC study, Dr. Keegan’s central hypothesis is that healthcare associated pathogens are spreading
primarily indirectly between patients and environmental surfaces via patient shedding and inadequate source
control. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, Dr. Keegan will test her hypotheses and develop methods to
apply to future data sets (for a future proposed R01 application during the K01 period). In Specific Aim 1, Dr.
Keegan will test the hypothesis that there will be phylogenetic support for clustering between pathogens
isolated from the environment and those isolated from patients. In Specific Aim 2 she will construct and
validate a model that integrates contact network data with pathogen genomic data to probabilistically infer the
direction of transmission events within a HCF. In Specific Aim 3, she will test the hypothesis that the majority of
patient-to-patient transmission events are mediated by environmental surfaces.
The proposed research is significant because it addresses a critical barrier to improving infection control:
without quantifying the role of different sources for pathogen transmission, infection control practices cannot
intentionally target the key transmission steps. The proposed research is innovative because a method to
infer transmission events for bacteria does not currently exist despite its critical importance in infection control."
10875293,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant complication of prematurity
affecting nearly 70% in infants born ≤28 weeks. Current pharmacologic strategies to
mitigate the development and progression of BPD include administration of long-acting
synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) such as dexamethasone (Dex). Several randomized
clinical trials establish that sGC therapy targeted to preterm infants with evolving lung
injury decreases BPD risk substantially, but encumber significant risks related to adverse
somatic growth and long-lasting alterations in brain structure and function. Therefore,
there remains an urgent need for GC pharmacotherapy for BPD in neonates that will
provide beneficial anti-inflammatory and lung maturation effects, but limited adverse
effects on the brain. Ciclesonide (CIC) is a new generation inhaled sGC currently
approved for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis that does not cause systemic
adverse effects often observed with other sGCs. Clinical trials also demonstrate no
adverse effects of CIC beyond placebo in 2-year olds. We hypothesize that CIC will
attenuate hyperoxia-mediated acute lung injury in neonates but NOT trigger the
demyelination, astrogliosis, microglia activation or neuronal damage in neonatal brain
caused by systemically administered sGCs such as Dex. Three Specific Aims are
proposed to test this hypothesis with a multi-disciplinary team possessing the ability to
simultaneously investigate in vitro mechanisms and highly relevant rodent models of
neonatal lung injury. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which CIC prevents
hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and alveolar remodeling in experimental BPD. Aim 2
will identify the transcriptomic responses to CIC within individual cell types of neonatal
mouse lungs using scRNA-Seq. Aim 3 will compare the acute and long-term
consequences of neonatal Dex versus CIC exposure on brain architecture and behavior.
This study has potential to identify CIC as an effective sGC therapy for BPD with brain-
sparing effects, addressing the current dearth of therapies to prevent and/or treat BPD in
preterm infants."

Endogenous circadian clocks exist in all cells and tissues, including the autonomic nervous system, heart, and
vasculature. The resultant rhythms prepare the cardiovascular (CV) system for optimal function to match the
daily anticipated behavioral and environmental cycles, such as altered posture and increased activity after
awakening in the morning. However, the morning is also the most vulnerable time for adverse CV events,
including myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden cardiac death. Dr. Shea has pioneered the use of intensive,
multi-day laboratory experiments and uncovered substantial endogenous circadian rhythms across the CV
system in healthy humans. Dr. Shea also discovered that circadian rhythms exist in the CV reactivity to stressors
(i.e., there are different CV responses to identical stressors at different times of day). Dr. Shea’s work has led to
the concept that circadian rhythms in the CV system act as a ‘double-edged sword’: the normal amplified
responses in the morning aid the transition from sleep to activity in healthy individuals, but such exaggerated
responses are potentially perilous in individuals with underlying CV risk factors who are susceptible to adverse
events. Dr. Shea will lead a multi-disciplinary team of outstanding investigators to examine the broad question
of how the circadian system interacts with behavior-related CV responses to produce predictable daily variations
in CV risk profiles. To compare with healthy controls, studies will be performed in populations with increased
underlying susceptibility to CV disease, such as hypertension, midlife adults, and obstructive sleep apnea. The
overall team has expertise in circadian, sleep, stress, exercise and CV physiology, and positron emission
tomographic imaging of the balance of pre- and post-synaptic adrenergic function in the left ventricle in resting
humans. The investigators will use outstanding purpose-built facilities to perform the necessary intensive, multi-
day studies with nursing, bio-nutrition and clinical support services integrated with the team’s physiological
expertise. Dr. Shea has >30 years’ experience performing clinical research mainly focused on circadian rhythms
in healthy humans and their impact on CV disease risk factors, and he has performed the majority of the CV
physiology studies in humans that use validated circadian protocols. Dr. Shea has been well-funded with 25
consecutive years as PI of investigator-initiated federal grants. Dr. Shea’s publications are well-cited with a mean
relative citation ratio of 3.84 for original research papers in the past decade [2009-18], which is higher than the
90% percentile for all NIH-funded papers in the same field [NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis: iCite Tool]). Due to
the fast emerging recognition of the magnitude and extent of circadian rhythms throughout the body, including
circadian rhythms in drug targets, we are on the cusp of meaningful chronotherapeutic trials in CV medicine that
consider internal circadian time. These preclinical studies performed in this Research Program will provide the
critical and timely background needed to fully exploit these opportunities to improve therapy of CV disease."
10873988,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A key goal of biophysics is to predict the behavior of living systems. This goal is hampered by the fact that, when
examined at the single-cell level, this behavior appears largely unpredictable: Genetically identical cells, within
a uniform environment, exhibit heterogeneous phenotypes in terms of gene expression, signaling, and
consequent fate choice. This cellular individuality is observed throughout biology, from the emergence of
antibiotic resistance among bacteria, to cell differentiation in the early mammalian embryo, and numerous other
examples.
Studies over the last two decades have pinpointed the stochastic origins of cellular individuality, by
demonstrating that the inherent randomness (“noise”) of single-molecule events can be amplified into protein
number fluctuations at the cellular level. The picture that emerged from those studies is of living cells as “noisy
machines”, incapable of high precision, whose fate choices are subject to significant randomness. But the
widespread success of the “noise” concept in describing cellular heterogeneity also points to its weakness: It is
easy to describe single-cell properties as “stochastic” and map them into statistical distributions, but doing so
does not mean that we understand the underlying cellular process. On the contrary, by creating a façade of
understanding, a stochastic description may impede our efforts to uncover the deterministic factors that drive
single-cell behavior. Recent years have seen a growing awareness of this caveat and an increase in efforts to
identify the deterministic drivers (so-called “hidden variables”) of cellular individuality, but it is fair to say that we
still lack a satisfactory picture for what drives single-cell behavior even in the simplest systems, to say nothing
of more complex ones.
Research goal. The choice between rapid cell death (lysis) and viral dormancy (lysogeny), following infection of
E. coli by bacteriophage lambda, serves as a paradigm for the way genetic networks drive cell fate decisions,
and for the purported role of molecular randomness in this process. Building on our work over the last decade,
we will use lambda infection to identify hidden drivers of cellular individuality in gene regulation and fate choice.
By revealing how deterministic the decision process is, we aim to establish lambda as a paradigm for precise—
rather than “noisy”—cell fate choice. In parallel to the work on lambda, we will continue to develop tools for the
manipulation, imaging, analysis, and modeling of individual cells, and apply them in collaborative projects
addressing cellular individuality across diverse biological contexts."
10848391,"Administrative Core – Summary 
 The mission of the Administrative Core is to organize and provide logistical and fiscal leadership to the activities 
of the network and the assessment of all components of Vermont’s INBRE program, the Vermont Genetics Network 
(VGN). Through the Administrative Core, the remaining three Cores (Professional Development and Education (PDE), 
Proteomics, and Bioinformatics) function to improve the culture of research in the State of Vermont. The Administrative 
Core also assures compliance with NIH policies and regulations of the lead and baccalaureate partner institutions. 
 The Administrative Core provides the central leadership for Vermont Genetics Network (VGN). It consists of the 
Principal Investigator (PI), the Program Coordinator, the Operations Coordinator, and support staff. A Leadership 
Committee, formed in Year 4 of the current INBRE cycle (INBRE 3), was established to provide bi-weekly input into issues 
facing VGN and to set goals. The Internal Steering Committee (ISC) provides guidance and advice throughout the year. 
The Coordinators at our baccalaureate partner institutions, guided by the Program Coordinator, interface with the 
Professional Development and Education, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics Cores. External evaluations by our External 
Advisory Committee (EAC), AAAS, and FlintSprings Consultants provide an ongoing assessment of our program. 
 The Core administers the Developmental Research Program of awards to BPI faculty with the PDE Director by 
organizing the application process, review process, communication of recommendations to the EAC, and compliance 
with regulations for use of vertebrate animals, human subjects, toxic agents, etc. 
 The Administrative Core organizes and implements the many-layered assessment plan that includes reports on 
annual and longitudinal surveys of all participants by our external evaluator, Dr. Joy Livingston; tracking of all students 
and faculty; ISC reports; AAAS consultant reports and the External Advisory Committee (EAC). The EAC provides critical, 
stimulating and thoughtful advice for formative assessment. The AAAS and Dr. Livingston provide summative 
assessment. 
 During INBRE 4, the Administrative Core will build on the successful existing operating procedures and 
strategies. A centralized, organizational, and fiscal administration provides the framework to deliver comprehensive 
services and programs for the Network, and ensures that VGN achieves its goal of expanding the research infrastructure 
within the State of Vermont."
10848397,"Developmental Research Project Plan – Summary 
 The Developmental Research Project Plan describes the processes by which competitive awards 
to baccalaureate partner institutions (BPI) faculty are requested, reviewed and awarded. This plan is at 
the heart of the INBRE and IDeA goals to make network faculty competitive for extramural funding. The 
plan is designed to assist network faculty who work in a variety of research areas, from molecular 
genetics to human physiology. 
 In addition to the Project and Pilot Awards (which have been in place for 15 years) and Small 
Awards (which have been in place for 4 years), we will implement an Exploratory Award. This award is 
for applications which have some merit but are not sufficient for a Project or Pilot Award. The 
Developmental Research Project Plan also describes the plans for improving the quality of applications 
to VGN and to extramural agencies and strategies to assist the faculty, including grant writing workshops 
and intensive follow-up coaching for timely application submissions through our Professional 
Development and Education (PDE) Core. Also with the PDE Core, the faculty will be provided with 
mentoring by research advisors and the PDE Core Director, including the development of an Individual 
Development Plan. VGN will continue to train BPI staff in grant management. 
 The Developmental Research Project Plan, coordinated with the PDE Core for mentoring and 
coaching, uses some of the best practices that we have identified in use in other INBREs, such as 
required grant writing workshops. 
 There are qualified investigators at all network Baccalaureate Partner Institutions, sufficient to 
submit meritorious applications for our Project and Pilot Awards each year. We have long-term 
experience with solicitation of proposals, assembly of review panels, review of applications, and 
compliance with federal policies and guidelines. 
 Milestones have been set for improving of quality of applications to VGN and success in 
applications to federal agencies and foundations. We continue to track our network faculty who have 
been funded by VGN."
10810701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly seen in infants diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no approved therapies
that target the prevention of AKI. Several small trials in infants with HIE suggest that a single dose of
theophylline given soon after birth attenuates the development of AKI. However, these studies were not
performed in infants being treated with therapeutic hypothermia (the current standard of care for moderate to
severe HIE), and only reported short-term outcomes. Therefore, few clinicians use theophylline in the
management of these patients. Our long-term goal is to undertake an appropriately powered multicenter
clinical trial to test the hypothesis that for infants > 35 weeks gestation treated with therapeutic hypothermia for
HIE, intravenous theophylline (or aminophylline) within the first 12 hours after birth will result in a decreased
incidence and/or severity of AKI or death (composite primary outcome) and improved long-term (2 year) renal
outcomes. Before the conduct of a large trial, the feasibility of implementing the intervention and ability to
measure relevant clinical outcomes need to be demonstrated. Therefore, we propose a small pilot and
feasibility clinical trial to i) evaluate recruitment, protocol adherence, and data collection procedures in a
therapeutic trial of theophylline to decrease the incidence of AKI or death compared to placebo in infants with
HIE being treated with therapeutic hypothermia; ii) evaluate the utility and applicability of established measures
(serum creatinine, urine output, fluid balance) and novel, exploratory approaches (urine biomarkers, large renal
tubular extracellular vesicles and renal oxygen saturation) to identify AKI in infants; and iii) determine
theophylline pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety and preliminary effectiveness profiles of two different
theophylline dosing regimens in a therapeutic trial of theophylline to decrease the incidence of AKI or death
compared to placebo. Using a mixed methods data analysis strategy to assess the research and intervention
process and examine outcomes of the intervention, we will generate the requisite data to inform development
and implementation of an appropriately powered study to determine whether theophylline attenuates the risk
and severity of AKI in infants with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia."

 Enteric infection with Shigella spp. can lead to symptoms ranging from acute watery diarrhea to sudden,
severe dysentery. Approximately 212,000 diarrheal deaths annually are attributed to Shigella (12.5% of total
diarrheal deaths) with a disproportionate impact in low resource countries. The impact in low resource countries
was illustrated by a reanalysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) which found that Shigella has the
highest attributable fraction for diarrhea in children < 60 months. While recent studies have highlighted the
burden of the disease, there has been a concurrent reduction in therapeutic options for the treatment of
shigellosis as drug resistant strains increase in prevalence. In addition, increasing reports of drug resistant
shigellosis cases in the men who have sex with men community confirm that the impact is not limited to children
in low resource settings. While there is a clear need for new shigellosis treatments, it is not clear what
characteristics of current therapies contribute to their efficacy and emergence of resistance. The goals of the
proposed work are to determine exposure-response relationships for antibacterials and to establish a rigorous
preclinical framework which can be used to identify and optimize new therapeutics for treatment of shigellosis.
 Our previous innovative studies on the gut localized pathogen Cryptosporidium demonstrated the
importance of gastrointestinal drug exposure for in vivo efficacy. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
(PK/PD) relationship for anti-Cryptosporidium drugs was characterized with in vitro and in vivo models of
cryptosporidiosis. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that a similar approach can be used to establish the
relationship between antibacterial exposure and in vivo efficacy against Shigella. In addition, we believe our
models can be used to identify antibacterial concentrations associated with the emergence of resistance.
Towards our hypothesis, we will use our established mouse model of Shigella infection to characterize the in
vivo efficacy of WHO recommended antibacterial treatments for shigellosis. In addition, we will use an innovative
hollow fiber infection model to investigate the emergence of antibacterial resistance. This crucial information will
assist in rationalizing dosing regimens for current treatments and will support discovery and development of
future therapeutics. We propose to evaluate the PK/PD relationship for antibacterials by undertaking the following
three Specific Aims: (1) Determine in vivo exposure-response relationships for antibacterials and (2)
Characterize antibacterial efficacy and emergence of resistance with a Shigella hollow fiber infection model.
 Taken together, these studies will help us better understand current shigellosis treatments and will
provide a series of methods to identify and optimize new treatments. In addition, the results of the work will
provide fundamental support for drug discovery in infectious disease, especially in the area of enteric infections."
10853130,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Immunotherapy can be highly effective against cancers that elicit some recognition from the immune
system (e.g., melanoma), but it remains ineffectual against cancers that are largely invisible to immune detection
(e.g., pancreatic cancer). Advances in cancer immunotherapy will require interventions that can make cancers
more apparent to the immune system. A growing body of evidence suggests that focused ultrasound (FUS)
tumor ablation could be that intervention. By non-invasively disrupting cancer cells, thermal and mechanical
modes of FUS have been shown to trigger surprisingly potent immune responses against tumors. We have
found that histotripsy, a non-thermal mode of mechanical FUS, stimulates a powerful and systemic anti-tumor
immune response strong enough to cause abscopal regression of distant, non-ablated tumor sites – effects not
generally seen with traditional therapies like radiation or thermal ablation. Histotripsy is a technology that is
presently being introduced into clinical use; therefore, it will be imperative to understand the mechanistic
underpinnings of histotripsy immunostimulation. Our preliminary studies point to a stepwise series of events that
may explain this phenomenon. First, histotripsy causes the release of subcellular cancer cell antigens in a
manner that preserves their immunogenic integrity. Second, histotripsy induces cancer cells to undergo a
specific pathway of cellular suicide called necroptosis – a death pathway that attracts inflammation and immune
attention, effectively priming the immune system to recognize cancer antigens. What follows is a progressive
infiltration of CD8+ T cells into distant tumors that is accompanied by another pathway of cancer cell death called
ferroptosis – a death pathway recently discovered to be the critical mechanism by which immunotherapy-primed
CD8+ T cells kill cancer cells.
 In this proposal, we will retrace these steps to understand how histotripsy exerts its unusually potent
immune effects. First, we will quantitatively fine-tune the parameters of histotripsy tissue cavitation that cause
maximally immunogenic tumor antigen release. Next, we will focus on the early induction of necroptosis to
determine if this is a necessary local precursor event on which later manifestations of histotripsy
immunostimulation depend. Then, we will examine the later process of CD8+ T cell-driven ferroptosis to
determine if this is the mechanism by which the distant, abscopal effects of histotripsy are mediated. Finally, we
will leverage mechanistic insights gained from these investigations to develop and test potential preclinical
strategies with which the effects of histotripsy on tumor antigen release, necroptosis, and ferroptosis could be
maximized for cancer immunotherapy. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in FUS,
immunology and cancer immunotherapy to pursue this work, which promises to reveal insights and strategies to
bring the impact of cancer immunotherapy to a wider range of patients in need of cure."
10857271,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Suicide and overdose deaths are at record levels, and the Emergency Department (ED) is at the forefront of
delivering care to those at the highest risk. Opioid use disorders (OUD) and mental illness are major
contributors to both. In 2017 nearly half of suicide and overdose deaths were linked to opioid use, with the
highest death rates seen in people with both OUD and mental illness. Medications for OUD (MOUD) saves
lives, and substantial research has documented the dose-response relationship between retention in MOUD
care, all-cause mortality, and suicide/overdose. The California Bridge Program (CA Bridge) is the largest ED-
based addiction treatment implementation project in the US; the primary goal is to improve MOUD access and
linkage to outpatient care for patients with OUD. However, data from the first 52 hospitals suggest that over
60% of patients had not filled an outpatient MOUD prescription two weeks after the ED visit; national data
suggest that even when patients start MOUD, many discontinue treatment, putting them at increased risk of
relapse, overdose, and death. Given finite resources, ED providers need evidence-based guidance about
the optimal way to manage patients where there is both between-person heterogeneity (despite being
offered services many patients do not access them) and within-person heterogeneity (even when MOUD is
initiated many patients discontinue treatment), and information about whether patients with a prior history of
either overdose or a co-occurring mental illness should receive a different sequence of interventions. This
combination of between- and within-person heterogeneity, suggests the need for an adaptive intervention
(AI) approach, whereby MOUD service-delivery interventions are adapted based on the patient’s initial
presentation and changing status. We propose a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to inform
the development of an AI that is optimally effective in increasing buprenorphine use for adults presenting to the
ED with an OUD-related event. Our primary outcome is the number of days a prescription for buprenorphine
was filled in the 6 months following the initial ED visit. Our pre-specified secondary outcome is a composite
measure of the time between ED presentation and subsequent overdose or suicide events, including death. To
conduct the study, we leverage a partnership between RAND, UCLA, Stanford and two hospitals that were
early adopters of CA Bridge. ED providers typically provide time-limited care for acute problems in the ED,
forcing an unrealistic and high-stakes hand off during a critical transition point. Testing different service-
delivery interventions and proactively addressing the key nature of this transition, is innovative and puts
forward a new vision of ED care. Our study is aligned with NIDA’s priorities as outlined in NOT-NS-20-005 and
will provide definitive answers to multiple critical questions, necessary for building an optimal AI that has the
potential to increase long-term MOUD use and save lives being lost to overdose, suicide, and untreated OUD."
10932855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a term used to describe a series of properties possessed by the vasculature of
the central nervous system (CNS) that play a critical role in maintaining a precisely regulated microenvironment
for optimal neuronal signaling. The essential physiological functions of the BBB in supporting brain homeostasis
are manifested within its most critical component, brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). Diminished EC
barrier function and the consequent increase in vascular permeability significantly contribute to tissue damage,
intracerebral hemorrhage and edema formation, as evidenced in pathologies of the CNS including stroke, cancer
and brain trauma. We recently discovered that heterozygous global deletion of Polymerase δ-interacting protein
2 (Poldip2), a protein that regulates important fundamental processes, significantly protects against BBB
disruption, edema and neuroinflammation induced by cerebral ischemia. While informative, these studies were
performed in mice with a global deletion of Poldip2, an approach that prevented us from determining the
mechanism of action and the specific cell types responsible for the observed phenotype. Our exciting new
preliminary data suggests that knockout of Poldip2 specifically in the endothelium remarkably prevents BBB
disruption after cerebral ischemia. Our in vitro studies further demonstrate that several mechanisms linked to EC
barrier integrity are affected, including stress fiber formation and distribution of the key junctional adaptor protein
ZO-1. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Poldip2 regulates EC cytoskeleton organization,
junctional stability via ZO-1, and cell-cell adhesion to mediate EC barrier function and BBB permeability following
brain ischemia, and using our novel animal models will test the in vivo relevance and therapeutic potential of
these observations. To test this hypothesis, in the first aim we will investigate the mechanisms by which Poldip2
regulates the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA activity, myosin light chain phosphorylation and brain EC gap formation
in vivo and in vitro. In the second aim, we will explore a potential NADPH oxidase Nox4/reactive oxygen species-
driven mechanism by which Poldip2 regulates the stability of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 at areas of
cell–cell contact in brain endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Finally, in the third aim, to increase the rigor of our
proposed studies and to begin to define the potential therapeutic value of Poldip2 inhibition, we will investigate
if inhibition of endothelial Poldip2 in vivo using adeno-associated virus will prevent BBB dysfunction and edema,
resulting in improved motor function and survival after cerebral ischemia. We will also use single cell RNA
sequencing on brain samples isolated from EC specific Poldip2 knockout mice to examine how Poldip2 depletion
in ECs affects transcriptional and cellular responses in additional components of the BBB leading to the anti-
permeability phenotype observed following cerebral ischemia. Completion of these three aims will shed new light
into mechanisms involved in brain EC permeability and BBB dysfunction and will allow us to gain new insights
into potential approaches for regulating cerebral vascular leakage in clinically meaningful ways."
10885087,"SUMMARY
Obesity affects 2.8 billion people worldwide and is the second leading cause of premature mortality.
Unfortunately, current treatments do not produce lasting weight loss, potentially because of an incomplete
understanding of the risk processes that promote obesity. After eating to fullness individuals with obesity
versus without obesity show weaker satiation signaling, as indexed by elevated responsivity of reward
valuation and gustatory regions in response to food cues and food tastes and stronger connectivity between
these brain regions. Behaviorally, obesity is associated with consumption of excess calories ab libitum when
sated, along with reduced perceived fullness and less perception of homeostatic signals during satiation.
Although research has established that obesity is correlated with weaker satiation signaling, no study has
determined whether weaker satiation signaling increases the risk for future overeating and weight gain or is a
consequence of overeating. Thus, we propose to conduct a rigorous prospective study designed to determine
the direction of influence between these two variables. We will recruit 132 healthy-weight adolescents (aged:
13-16; n=80 at high risk for obesity virtue of maternal obesity) for a multimodal, repeated-measures study
using a novel fMRI paradigm designed to capture neurobehavioral changes over the course of eating to
satiation. We will also include objective measures of body fat, food intake, gut hormones, and cognitive
measures. Aim 1: We will a) test the hypothesis that over the course of eating to satiation healthy-weight
adolescents at high-risk versus low-risk for obesity (virtue of maternal obesity) will show persistently elevated
brain response to energy-dense food tastes in the striatum, postcentral gyrus, and gustatory cortex. Aim 2: We
will a) test the hypothesis that participants who show weaker satiation signaling, as evidenced by persistently
elevated responsivity in the striatum, postcentral gyrus, and gustatory regions after eating to fullness will show
elevated future body fat gain over a 3-year follow-up, and b) test the ability of individual differences in a
satiated brain fingerprint to predict future body fat gain over a 3-year follow-up. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that
the degree of percent body fat gain at 3-year follow-up will be related to a reduction in satiation signaling, as
indexed by a) higher responsivity in striatal, postcentral gyrus, and gustatory regions after eating to fullness
over the course of satiation, and b) increased engagement of these regions in a brain fingerprint when satiated.
If data provide support for Aims 1 and 2, but not Aim 3, results would suggest that weaker satiation signaling
increases risk for weight gain. In contrast, if data provide support for Aim 3, but not Aim 1 and 2, results would
suggest that weaker satiation signaling is a consequence of overeating. Finally, if data provide support for all 3
Aims, results would suggest that weaker satiation signaling increases risk for overeating and weight gain, and
further that this overeating further attenuates satiation signaling in a dynamic feed-forward fashion."

Mechanisms Controlling the Development and Function of Intestinal Effector Treg Cells. The
pathogenesis of a spectrum of disorders referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by
immune dysregulation to components of the enteric microbiota. Findings from mouse and man highlight a critical,
non-redundant role for the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis.
Our labs have shown that Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are, overwhelmingly, the major source of IL-10 in the
intestines, where many of these cells co-express the canonical “Th17” transcription factor, RORt—particularly
in large intestine (LI). However, IL-10 is only produced by a subset of Treg cells—defined as ‘effector’ (e)Treg
cells. Mechanisms that control the development of eTreg cells are incompletely understood. The premise of this
application, founded on recent discoveries from, and synergy between, the two PIs (Weaver, Hatton) is that
heretofore unappreciated interplay between signaling pathways of the IL-2 and TNF superfamilies has a central
role in regulating the development and function of eTreg cells in the intestines. Specifically, we have identified
the TNF receptor superfamily signaling pair, TNFSF15-TNFRSF25 (TL1A-DR3), as an important amplifier of the
transition of “central” (c)Treg cells into eTreg cells and propose that this pathway plays an important role in
calibrating IL-2–driven control of the Treg cell program via multiple mechanisms. We hypothesize that the TL1A-
DR3 pathway is non-redundant in its regulation of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling to modulate the size and cTreg–
eTreg balance of the LI Treg cell pool both at homeostasis and under inflammatory conditions. Further, we posit
that DR3 acts through multiple mechanisms to alter output of the IL-2R to regulate development of IL-10–
producing eTreg cells. We propose that a major driver of eTreg cell development is increased STAT3 output of
the IL-2R, which is enhanced by actions of DR3 to: (i) increase sensitivity of the IL-2R; and (ii) decrease pSTAT3
degradation, thereby altering the IL-2–induced STAT5/STAT3 ratio. Finally, we propose that other TNFRSF
members contribute to eTreg cell maintenance after DR3 expression declines. We test this hypothesis through
complementary, but not inter-dependent, Aims, leveraging: a novel method for generating stable, colitis-curing
Treg cells ex vivo; new approaches for efficient gene knock-downs in primary T cells; and new gene-targeted
mouse models to define mechanisms governing the convergence of these signaling pathways in controlling the
transcriptional regulation of Il10 and the eTreg program. Successful completion of these Aims will establish new
biological paradigms and inform novel therapeutic approaches by which endogenous IL-10 can be up-regulated
and the differentiation and function of eTreg cells enhanced to treat human IBD."

A major challenge for recovering methamphetamine (Meth) users is persistence of vulnerability to craving and
relapse even after long periods of abstinence. We study plasticity underlying this persistent vulnerability using
the `incubation of craving' model, in which rats exhibit progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced
craving after withdrawal from extended-access drug self-administration (SA). Incubation of craving occurs in
humans, so the model has translational relevance. We previously showed that high conductance Ca2+-permeable
AMPARs (CP-AMPAR) accumulate in synapses on medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the nucleus accumbens
core (NAcc) after withdrawal from Meth SA, strengthening these synapses, and that blocking CP-AMPAR or
removing them from synapses prevents expression of Meth incubation. Thus, glutamate inputs onto NAcc MSN
must be required for Meth incubation, but there have been no previous pathway-specific studies to identify them.
We propose to test the role of the two MSN subtypes in NAcc (D1 and D2 MSN) and glutamate inputs to NAcc
originating from basolateral amygdala (BLA), prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL/PFC) and paraventricular nucleus
of the thalamus (PVT); these inputs are strongly implicated in regulating drug seeking. We hypothesize that CP-
AMPAR plasticity occurs in D1 MSN, but that both MSN subtypes and glutamate inputs from all three upstream
regions contribute to expression of Meth incubation. To distinguish D1 and D2 MSN, we will use well validated
transgenic rats (male and female) expressing Cre recombinase in neurons that express the D1 or the adenosine
2a (A2a) receptor. In the rat NAc, D2 and A2a receptors are colocalized. Thus, these rat lines enable selective
manipulation of D1 or A2a/D2 MSN and, when crossed with reporter lines, enable their visualization. Aim 1 will
use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to assess excitatory synaptic transmission in BLA, PL/PFC, and PVT
inputs to D1 and A2a MSN before and after Meth incubation, focusing on, but not limited to, CP-AMPAR plasticity.
Aim 2 will use fiber photometry to measure Ca2+ responses time-locked to active hole nose-pokes during cue-
induced seeking tests before and after incubation. First, we will measure Ca2+ in D1 and A2a MSN by expressing
Cre-dependent GCaMP in NAcc of D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rats. Then, to obtain a presynaptic measure, we will
record from BLA, PL/PFC and PVT axon terminals in NAcc by expressing axon-GCaMP in the upstream regions
and allowing time for its transport to NAcc terminals. Aim 3 will use chemogenetics to determine if D1 or A2a
MSN and BLA-NAcc, PL/PFC-NAcc or PVT-NAcc pathways are necessary for expression of incubation. First,
we will express the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in D1 or A2a MSN and administer the DREADD ligand J60
systemically before an early or late withdrawal (incubated) seeking test. Then, we will express the inhibitory
DREADD in BLA, PL/PFC or PVT, allow time for its transport to NAcc terminals, and infuse J60 into NAcc prior
to early or late withdrawal seeking tests. These will be the first studies to determine pathway-specific plasticity
in NAcc during Meth incubation and identify MSN subtypes and glutamate inputs required for its expression."
10880647,"Dementia in older adults is clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous. Understanding this
heterogeneity and addressing all the biological pathways that increase risk and lower resilience, will be
required to provide precision prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have implicated over 40 genes, multiple cell and varied biological pathways (amyloid, tau, endolysosomal,
mitochondrial function, inflammation). Genetic and multiomic characterization of ADRD in individuals, and in
groups of patients, could exploit this heterogeneity towards more effective, precise, personalized prevention
and treatment of dementia. Whereas, most of these biological discoveries have been in non-Hispanic whites,
there is a paucity of data on Mexican American (MA) Hispanics, who are the fastest growing segment of older
adults in the US. The Genetics and Multiomics Core (GMC) of the South Texas Alzheimer Disease
Consortium (STAC) has the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Identifying causal genetic variation underlying ADRD in CC enrollees through a combination of
routine clinical sequencing and a ‘Undiagnosed Disease Network’ approach to identifying novel genetic
variation that may be causal or contributory. To achieve this, we will record results of clinical sequencing and
genetic counseling in proband and relatives.
 Aim 2: Genetically characterize all CC enrollees (using APOE and GWAS) to expand our
understanding of genetic variation modifying risk, resilience and disease progression. We will aim to refine
and improve genetic risk estimates for late onset AD, PD, DLB permitting more accurate risk stratification in
MA Hispanics, better targeting for recruitment in clinical trials.
 Aim 3: Serve as a resource for STAC investigators, trainees, and the national ADRD research
community for deeply phenotyped Hispanic MA samples, genomic data and innovative analysis methods.
 To achieve this (i) GMC will share DNA, genetic and phenotypic data (clinical, MRI and PET imaging,
blood and CSF -amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolomic, lipidomic- and sensory-motor biomarkers) and digital
and conventional neuropathology, through NCRAD, NIAGADS, NACC; (ii) GMC will serve as a STAC
resource for providing methylation, transcriptomics (blood, brain, CSF), ATAC-Seq, single-cell omics data and
for generating usable iPSCs and organoids; (iii) GMC will develop and share innovative genetic and multiomic
association analyses methods, especially for use in large families; (iv) GMC will facilitate collaborations with
consortia such as the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), the International Genomics of AD
Project (IGAP), Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) and Transomics
in Precision Medicine (TOPMed); (v) GMC faculty and resources will support the Research Education Core in
developing a diverse workforce, well-trained in applying genetic and multiomic research methods."

The overall objective of the Neuropathology Core of the UK-ADRC is to support research on normal brain
aging, presymptomatic AD, MCI, early and late AD, mixed dementia syndromes, and other dementing
disorders. Autopsies will be performed by our Rapid Autopsy Team on longitudinally followed subjects from our
Clinical Core. We will perform short post-mortem interval autopsies, and we will maintain a high autopsy rate.
This Core is optimally tailored to help address important research questions. The Core will provide brain tissue,
CSF and other biospecimens for investigators at UK, other ADRCs, and outside investigators. The Core will
also provide consensus conference determined diagnoses, quantitation of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic
plaques, and diffuse plaques from 8 brain regions, Ab quantitation, Braak staging, CERAD, and NIA-Reagan
Institute staging on all autopsied cases, along with evaluation of alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 proteinopathy.
This brain bank has been operating continuously for over three decades with a strong track record, so special
care will be taken to ensure diagnostic excellence, consistency, and continuity. The Core will maintain a tissue
bank of the above specimens and frozen serum, plasma, buffy coats and CSF from living patients. Special
emphasis will be placed on generating rigorous quantititative pathologic metrics from digital pathology, and
providing investigators with specimens from cognitively intact control subjects with no Ab deposition and
sparse tau pathology (successful cerebral aging) and many cases with mixed pathologies. Providing these
samples will contribute to clinical-pathological correlation studies and cutting-edge research that include
sponsored studies related to AD genomics, oxidative stress, hippocampal sclerosis/LATE, dementia with Lewy
bodies, Down syndrome, and neuroinflammation. Frequent consensus conferences will be held with the
Clinical, Biomarker, and Data Management and Statistics Cores to help define clinical-pathological diagnoses
on all autopsied subjects. The Neuropathology Core is strongly integrated with other Cores of the UK-ADRC,
and exploits unique opportunities to conduct clinical-pathological correlative studies on longitudinally followed
subjects. Through these methods we will better understand normal brain aging and the transition to multi-
etiology dementia with the goal of contributing to therapeutic or preventive measures. The Neuropathology
Core complements the other Cores of the UK-ADRC to provide extremely essential diagnoses and tissue
samples that are required for many cutting-edge researchers at the University of Kentucky and elsewhere. We
will build on our track record of excellence using innovative tools related to brain autopsies, neuropathological
diagnoses, tissue banking, and clinical-pathological correlation. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Provide state-of-the-art neuropathological and biospecimen repository services
Aim 2: Leverage neuropathology resources and expertise to contribute to research efforts
Aim 3: Integrate with other cores to contribute to administrative, research and educational missions"
10880651,"Understanding the complexity of heterogeneous and intersecting neurodegenerative disorders entails
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative assessment of the central nervous system. Hence, the
Neuropathology Core (NPC) is a pivotal component of the South Texas Alzheimer Center (STAC). Co-led by
Kevin Bieniek, PhD and Jamie Walker, MD PhD, both trained especially for establishing and leading a new
Brain Bank, this core comprehensively characterizes brain and spinal cord confirming clinical diagnoses, for
purposes of research, and to provide a diagnosis and advice to families.
 Future advancements in elucidating and intervening in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD) requires the study of diverse ethnoracial autopsy cohorts. The STAC NPC services
a large Mexican-American Hispanic population in the South Texas region. It will generate normative
(cognitively normal) and preclinical, clinical ADRD (AD, FTD/ALS, DLB, PSP, CBD, VCID) data on MA
Hispanic persons. Although our current brain samples are only 15% Hispanic, our fluid biobank has over 70%
Hispanics and our focused attention on recruitment should increase the proportion of Hispanic brains to over
50% over the next 5 years. A 24/7 no-cost, autopsy service, post-mortem MRI, ante-mortem imaging/clinical
assessments, family interviews, medical records increase the value of tissue obtained and shared with NACC.
 Interpreting ethnoracial pathological heterogeneity necessitates consideration of genetic and molecular
variation, hence STAC has undertaken routine WES on the 56 brains donated to date (a 400% increase since
our original submission) and proposes to undertake clinical genetic testing (with genetic counseling) in families
of registered donors (Clinical and Genetics/Multiomics Cores), WGS on donated brain tissue and routinely
preserves frozen brain tissue for additional omic (methylation, transcriptomics, ATAC-Seq, proteomics,
metabolomics) studies. The NPC employs state-of-the-art genetic and “omics” approaches to aid in the
interpretation of ADRD pathologies and identification of novel disease modifiers. The NPC undertakes routine
digital scanning of all slides, and spatial neuropathology.
 The aims of the NPC are: accessioning high-quality central nervous system autopsy biospecimens,
including brain, spinal cord, skin and cerebrospinal fluid (Aim 1); conducting data driven neuropathological
evaluations of this material (Aim 2); maintaining these resources in a dynamic biorepository for use by a range
of investigators (Aim 3); leading translational neuropathology research of multi-etiology dementia, including
those of degenerative, cerebrovascular, and traumatic origins (Aim 4); and educating the local scientific/trainee
(REC) and lay public communities on the importance of neuropathology and neurodegeneration research (Aim
5). The Neuropathology Core will accomplish these aims through collaborative relationships with other STAC
Cores and external investigators, including colleagues at other Alzheimer’s Disease Centers."
10880730,"Project Summary/Abstract: Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core
The Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core plays a central role in achieving UK-ADRC goals by
functioning as a key link between the Center and the local and state communities. ORE Core programs and
activities have created and will maintain an educated local community eager to receive updated information on
AD and to participate in our Center’s research. Through ORE Core efforts, the UK-ADRC will continue to work
with both the Commonwealth of Kentucky and UK partners in directing state and institutional responses to
meeting dementia health care needs and increasing health literacy in the elderly. ORE Core activities include
recruitment and retention of diverse participants into a longitudinal cohort with annual clinical examinations and
brain donation upon death. Other activities involve the development and testing of innovative outreach and
engagement activities in the community to increase awareness of AD/ADRD plus the importance of research
and research participation. Over the past five years, the ORE Core has taken the lead in developing innovative
partnerships and products to support research participation by African Americans, the largest minority group in
Kentucky. We will continue to emphasize recruitment and retention of research participants at the earliest
stages of the cognitive continuum (Cognitively Normal and MCI). These efforts involve engaging these
participants in the ADRC longitudinal cohort, as well as activities to enhance agreement to brain donation,
willingness to engage in affiliated clinical studies and therapeutic trials, and donation of antemortem
biospecimens. In the next cycle, we will maintain and further build on these efforts and partnerships through
the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Recruit and retain participants into our longitudinal cohort, affiliated research, and NIA initiatives,
focusing on improving recruitment and retention of African Americans and other URGs.
Aim 2. Increase community awareness of AD and ADRD through the promotion of health literacy that further
enhances recruitment and retention of minority participants in research.
Aim 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of our activities with both qualitative and quantitative metrics.
Aim 4. Support the UK-ADRC Cores to maximize national and international collaborations.
The ORE Core plays a critical role in the UK-ADRC and works closely with the other Cores to support
recruitment and retention activities for research protocols, clinical trials, and national initiatives; increase
community awareness of AD and maintain a strong presence in the African-American community; and support
outreach initiatives for the lay community in collaboration with key partners. These functions are vital to the UK-
ADRC mission to catalyze outstanding and innovative research, outreach, education, and clinical programs."
10880654,"The cost of dementia care in the US will be $1 Trillion by 2050. Moreover, this burden will be highest among
minorities, a group that is itself diverse. The Hispanic/Latino population of South Texas, comprised of persons
of Mexican American ancestry, is the nation’s fastest growing minority but is woefully under-represented in
ADRD research. Reaching and studying this population requires a culturally attuned, highly skilled cohort of
researchers and clinicians who recognize that dementia in this group is likely to have different genetic, social,
environmental and behavioral risk and resilience factors, heterogenous biology (e.g. greater vascular/metabolic
contributions) and care needs (e.g. higher caregiver burden). Expanding the research and clinical workforce
will necessitate attracting the brightest minds from related disciplines to dementia research. It also requires
being able to recruit, retain and support the career growth of fellows and faculty, with diverse race-, ethnic-,
social backgrounds, providing additional, targeted support for promising women and under-represented
minority researchers who may lack access to mentoring networks or key information.
 The Research Education Core (REC) of the STAC, will be a leader in achieving this and sharing our
insights nationally. The REC is led by Profs. Cavazos, Maestre and Mahaney who each have deep roots in the
Hispanic community and South Texas, a superb track record of successful NIH and VA funding and of
academic mentoring especially minority (Hispanic) MD and MD/PhD researchers. They will be supported by
other outstanding senior faculty and an impressive cadre of emerging mentors. The REC will offer a 12 credit-
hour Graduate Certificate on Dementia and developmental grants to introduce a wide range of health
professionals to issues in dementia research. The flagship program of our REC will be to identify and support
9 outstanding faculty candidates, through 2- year K type awards that include a mentored research
experience, strong career guidance and culminate in external research funding. Our goal is to grow thought
leaders in ADRD research. We propose these Specific Aims: 1) Grow a cadre of researchers representing
and/or focusing on all aspects of Hispanic health 2) Broad training across clinical, laboratory, imaging,
computational, omics, epidemiology, biostatistics, social science and community engagement domains 3)
Emphasis on training clinician, basic and population science researchers to become independent investigators
skilled in T1 and T2 translation, team science and mentoring 4) Emphasis on instruction in cutting-edge
technologies and analysis methods with a focus on precision medicine approaches and optimal, community
and person centered prevention and care. We will carefully evaluate program effectiveness and adjust
accordingly. UTHSA and UTRGV are national leaders in Hispanic education and recruitment and the STAC
REC will leverage the rich local training environment (AD-RCMAR, CTSI, Pepper, Nathan Shock, GRECC,
military research/researchers) to grow superb ADRD researchers."
10823325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Severe subglottic stenosis, the narrowing of the airway just below the vocal folds, develops as a response to
intubation in close to 10% of the > 20,000 premature births per year in the United States. Severe cases require
laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR), in which surgeons split the cricoid and add a piece of autologous patient-
derived cartilage to expand the airway and restore proper airflow. However, in children, the success rate is as
low as 50% with a high incidence of restenosis requiring revision surgery. Graft failure is tied directly to the lack
of sufficiently sized autologous cartilage in the child, and tissue engineering has been proposed to develop
alterative grafting options for pediatric LTR. Some approaches, including some of our previous work, have
been effective in producing functional cartilage, but the overall timeframe required for the construct to match
the mechanical properties of native cartilage (>24 weeks) is not compatible with clinical translation (<8 weeks).
Furthermore, current cell sources such as expanded autologous chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells
frequently result in hypertrophic and calcified tissue. Our objective is to engineer a new type of cartilage
implant that is populated with patients’ cells, mechanically viable and suitable for LTR within a clinically
relevant timeframe. Our approach uses a microstructured polymeric scaffold with over 90% porosity and
sufficient mechanical properties and with a pore structure uniquely capable of enhancing chondrogenesis of
stem cells. Furthermore, cartilage progenitor cells have been proposed as a rapidly proliferating, highly
chondrogenic cell source. To harness these cells, we have developed a minimally invasive biopsy procedure to
harvest ear Cartilage Progenitor Cells (eCPCs). Our overarching hypothesis is that the microstructured
polymeric scaffold combined with eCPCs will create cartilage implants with suitable mechanical strength,
dimensions, and phenotypic stability for personalized, minimally invasive LTR. We propose to identify the
microstructure that achieves the maximum chondrogenesis and the specific mechanism of action. The capacity
of eCPCs to produce a robust cartilage phenotype, potentially better than that of ear chondrocytes and less
prone to calcification, will also be studied. Finally, the engineered cartilage derived from the eCPCs seeded in
the microporous scaffold will be test in a porcine LTR model. We expect that our findings will introduce a major
innovation in the treatment of subglottic stenosis, laying the basis for long term pre-clinical safety studies and
clinical translation in airway reconstructive surgery in children."

Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, and it is estimated to infect a third of the human
population globally. T. gondii infection can result in serious complications including congenital toxoplasmosis of
the fetus and death among immunocompromised individuals. Unfortunately, current regimens for T. gondii
treatment show high rates of toxicity, and are only able to treat the acute stage of the parasitic infection.
Therefore, there is an urgent need develop new medicines with specific efficacy against T. gondii. Host
immunity against T. gondii is defined by a MyD88-dependent IL-12 response, which generates a CD4+ Th1-
derived IFN-γ response necessary for host survival. The transcription factor T-bet is considered essential for
the development and function of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and TH1s during T. gondii infection. T-bet is
traditionally considered the master regulator of lymphocyte-derived interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production. Yet,
T-bet-independent ILC- and TH1-derived IFN-γ is insufficient for host immunity, demonstrating that IFN-γ alone
is insufficient for host defense and that T-bet must be inducing an IFN-γ-independent anti-parasitic response.
For instance, despite robust IFN-γ production, T-bet-deficient mice succumb to infection significantly faster
than animals lacking lymphocytes, suggesting T-bet-expressing myeloid cells are required for host survival.
Our objective is to define T-bet’s role in regulating myeloid cell-dependent immunity against T. gondii. Our
preliminary findings have identified a unique T-bet expressing CD11c+MHCII- myeloid cell population that are
critical for eliminating T. gondii. Based on these results, we hypothesize that T-bet expression in myeloid cells
regulates pathogen clearance and host survival during T. gondii infection. To test our hypothesis, we will (i)
determine the underlying mechanism(s) of T-bet in regulating myeloid cell-mediated defense against T. gondii
(AIM 1) and (ii) define the molecular functions of T-bet-expressing myeloid cells in mediating host resistance
against T. gondii (AIM 2). We will utilize unbiased T-bet reporter mice and cell-type-specific T-bet-deficient
mice established in our lab, in combination with various molecular biology techniques, spectral cytometry,
immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Together, these experiments will for the first time
establish T-bet’s role in mediating myeloid cell-dependent host defense against T. gondii, thereby providing
novel specific targets for therapeutic intervention."

Center for Transformative Community-Driven Research to Prevent Obesity-related Cancer (the Center)
seeks to reduce cancer risk, and ultimately improve cancer outcomes for communities experiencing persistent
poverty. We plan to bridge the gap between research and real-world practice through community-engaged
approaches to address obesity—the second leading preventable cause of cancer. The Center will focus its
activity on Acres Homes, a historic Black Community in Houston, Texas that has experienced persistent
poverty. The Center will test interventions in the context of MD Anderson’s current place-based cancer
prevention initiative (Be Well Communities™), around two scientific themes: 1) understanding social and
environmental context of poverty (e.g., food insecurity, limited recreational infrastructure, few health promotion
services) and 2) promoting health behavior changes of diet and physical activity as major contributing causes
of obesity. The two research projects span the cancer control continuum from primary prevention to
survivorship: Project 1 will test the effect of a multi-level nutrition intervention on BMI and metabolic health in
Acres Homes elementary school students and their parents, and Project 2 will adapt and test the effect of a
physical activity intervention for Acres Homes cancer survivors on physical functioning. Both will use a health
promotion interweaving approach to embed the interventions in the environmental context of Acres Homes and
Be Well Communities. The transdisciplinary approach used by the research projects will integrate behavioral
science, implementation science, geospatial analytics, and health communication. The Center will include five
cores: Administrative, Research and Methods, Career Enhancement, Developmental, and Engagement Core.
Our conceptual framework is informed by both the context of persistent poverty and the science of behavior
change. At the behavior change level, the conceptual framework incorporates the COM-B (Capability,
Opportunity, Motivation -Behavior) model of behavior change. In collaboration with Acres Homes community
leaders, the specific aims of the Center are to: (1) Test interventions to address risk factors for obesity-related
cancers using a health promotion interweaving approach in the context of Be Well™ Acres Homes, building on
the existing infrastructure of community collaboration, planning and programming; (2) Collaborate with
residents and community organizations to foster an environment that supports the conduct of research and the
implementation of programs that can alleviate the effects of persistent poverty; (3) Support the careers of
transdisciplinary teams of early-career researchers including trainees and early stage faculty and build their
expertise in conducting research to promote cancer prevention and control in persistent poverty communities,
with a focus on development of trainees and investigators from under-represented groups."
10814271,"The long-term goal is the elimination of cholera in Africa by identifying patterns of transmission that will
enable endemic African countries reduce the number of districts with cholera by stopping transmission within
and between districts. This goal is consistent with the goal of the Global Task Force for Cholera Control to
“eliminate” cholera from > 20 countries by 2030. Using innovative surveillance, molecular and GIS methods,
the study will conduct detailed molecular epidemiological studies in Nigeria, and Uganda to detect the spread
of specific V. cholerae (Vc) genetic lineages and vibriophage and will monitor the impact of interventions
intended to prevent cholera’s spread. By stopping cholera’s transmission within a country, the country will
reduce the number of districts with cholera; thereby, creating a “cholera elimination scorecard” with which to
monitor progress toward national elimination.
 This application builds on evidence from our initial RO1 study of cholera in Africa showing that cholera
lineages “spread to” rather than “emerge from” endemic areas, and strategies to control cholera need to adapt
to this new understanding. Many Sub-Saharan African countries are “endemic” since they regularly report
cholera cases; however, most outbreaks are short (few weeks), are limited to a few districts or subdistricts and
are caused by genetic lineages that move through an area and then die out. Because water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) is poor, these areas remain susceptible when a new genetic lineage is introduced.
 To improve the effectiveness of an elimination strategy, improved surveillance is needed to detect
outbreaks quickly to intervene and prevent outward transmission. Rapid molecular surveillance is now possible
with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) able to immediately identify cases while also providing DNA samples for
PCR confirmation and molecular characterization using MLVA. Stools will also be cultured to create a
repository of Vc strains, and feces will be spotted on filter paper and dried. The dried fecal samples (DFS) can
be stored indefinitely without refrigeration, are easily transported, are not biohazardous, and can be used to
detect Vc and vibriophage. Sewage samples will be collected to detect Vc and phage during and between
outbreaks to further characterize transmission of genetic lineages and phage. By combining intensive
surveillance, molecular epidemiology, and rapid evaluation of case GIS coordinates, quickly identified patterns
of cholera transmission should improve targeted interventions (vaccine and WASH).
 The project uses innovative new technologies developed during the initial RO1 grant applicable to
conditions in developing countries. These include evaluation of RDTs that allow results from RDTs to declare
an outbreak as well as be used for molecular studies, rapid detection of Vc using a new simplified LAMP assay
(termed RLDT), genotyping (MLVA) from DFS and RDTs, d) whole genome sequencing (WGS) from isolates
as well as DFS, and d) phage detection from DFS."
10817120,"The goal of this R01 application is to investigate the mechanisms by which T cells contribute to heart failure
(HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), affecting roughly 50% of the HF patients. Notably, the
treatments that improve survival and outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
have not provided clinical benefit in HFpEF patients, who often present with multiple comorbidities that
include obesity and hypertension. Correlative epidemiological studies in HFpEF patients, suggest a potential
contribution of inflammation to HFpEF. However the underlying immune mechanisms remain largely
unexplored. A unique myocardial hallmark of human HFpEF replicated in a pre-clinical model of
cardiometabolic HFpEF is the downregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which results in the
cellular inability to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the central function of the UPR, thus
impairing cardiomyocyte relaxation. Our preliminary data using an experimental model of cardiometabolic
HFpEF reveal the novel finding that cardiac T cell infiltration co-exists with diastolic dysfunction and
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and that T cell deficient mice (Tcra-/-) do not develop diastolic dysfunction or
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under the same conditions. Our data also reveal that genes encoding specific
ER stress response factors such as X-box protein 1 (XBP1s) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), are
remarkably downregulated in CD4+ T cells isolated from mice with cardiometabolic HFpEF, and not in T cells
from mice with HFrEF. T cell downregulation of XBP1s has been implicated in enhanced T cell effector
function and anti-tumor activity. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that dysregulation of T cell-
intrinsic ER stress responses promotes detrimental inflammation in cardiometabolic HFpEF. In Aim1, we will
use single cell antibody and RNA sequencing (CITE-Seq) to uncover the T cell transcriptional profiles
throughout the development of cardiometabolic HFpEF in WT mice, investigate the antigen dependence of
the T cell response, the dominant T cell subsets involved, and their ability to rescue the protective phenotype
observed in Tcra-/- recipient mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the expression of the T cell UPR during the
progression of cardiometabolic HFpEF and utilize gain-and loss-of- function approaches to define the
mechanisms by which the T cell UPR is compromised in cardiometabolic HFpEF and impacts T cell pro-
inflammatory effector function. In Aim 3, we will investigate the functional role of the T cell-intrinsic ER stress
response in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and function during the progression of HFpEF and the T cell derived
factors altered by the compromised UPR that impact cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and function, using mice
selectively lacking UPR effectors in T cells, and gain of function approaches,.
Successful accomplishment of the Aims proposed is expected to identify novel T cell intrinsic mechanisms
that foster detrimental immune responses in HFpEF, paving the way for the development of new
immunomodulatory strategies to confront this deadly syndrome."

Acting adaptively requires quickly picking up on structure in our environment (e.g., the layout of a city you are
visiting for the first time) and storing the acquired knowledge for effective future use (efficient navigation on
subsequent visits). Dominant theories of the hippocampus have focused on its ability to encode individual
snapshots of experience, but we and others have found evidence that it is also crucial for finding structure across
experiences (understanding the relationship between different views of the same distant building). The
mechanisms of this essential form of learning have not been established. We have developed a neural network
model of the hippocampus instantiating the theory that one of its subfields can quickly encode structure using
distributed representations, a powerful form of representation in which populations of neurons become
responsive to multiple related features of the environment. The first aim of this project is to test predictions of
this model using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in paradigms requiring integration
of information across experiences. The results will clarify fundamental mechanisms of how we learn novel
structure, adjudicating between existing models of this process, and informing further model development. There
are also competing theories as to the eventual fate of new hippocampal representations. One view posits that
during sleep, the hippocampus replays recent information to build longer-term distributed representations in
neocortex. Another view claims that memories are directly and independently formed and consolidated within
the hippocampus and neocortex. The second aim of this project is to test between these theories. We will assess
changes in hippocampal and cortical representations over time by re-scanning participants and tracking changes
in memory at a one-week delay. Any observed changes in the brain and behavior across time, however, may be
due to generic effects of time or to active processing during sleep. The third aim is thus to assess the specific
causal contributions of sleep to the consolidation of structured information. We will use real-time sleep
electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the peaks of slow oscillations, when endogenous replay is known to
occur, and play sound cues to bias memory reactivation. We will also expand our neural network model to
examine how offline hippocampal replay of recent regularities can shape distributed representations in
neocortex, providing a mechanistic account of offline consolidation of structured information. We expect that this
work will clarify the anatomical substrates and, critically, the nature of the representations that support encoding
and consolidation of novel structure in the environment. Having a robust, neurally grounded model of these
processes will help connect research in this area across laboratories and provide a framework for evaluating
what goes wrong in mental health disorders like depression and schizophrenia that involve profound
disturbances in learning and sleep."
10789949,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is unique in that it requires a two-step activation process: the priming and the activating. The priming step involves the induction of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, whereas the activating step results in the full inflammasome activation triggered by a NLRP3 activator. Although the mechanism leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been increasingly clear, the regulation of this process remains poorly defined. Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome has been frequently implicated in the bacterial pneumonia caused acute lung injury (ALI). MafB is a member of the large MAF transcription factor subfamily and has been implicated in immune disorders, which mainly concerns its role in macrophage apoptosis, phagocytosis and the complement system. In our preliminary studies, we made an unexpected discovery that uncovers a novel function of MafB in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings suggest that MafB is a new negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that LPS, and P. aeruginosa induced MafB downregulation is a crucial step for the NLRP3 inflammasome priming; MafB is a key player that regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome activation; MafB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI; as well as targeting MafB is an effective therapeutics for ALI. We aim to comprehensively delineate the regulation of MafB expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels during the NLRP3 inflammasome priming; to delineate the mechanism by which MafB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome activation; and to determine the role of MafB in LPS and P. aeruginosa induced acute lung injury (ALI)."
10817091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Roughly 1/3 of bone mass accrual during life is realized during adolescence. Disruption of this critical window of
skeletal maturation has lifelong implications for bone health and fracture risk. Systemic tetracyclines (i.e.,
minocycline, doxycycline) are commonly used to treat acne in adolescents, but the impact on bone is unclear.
 Preliminary studies were performed treating C57BL/6 mice with a clinically relevant dose of doxycycline or
minocycline during pubertal/postpubertal development. Administering doxycycline or minocycline to specific-
pathogen-free (SPF) mice caused dysbiotic shifts in the gut bacteriome and impaired skeletal maturation.
Administering minocycline to mice reared under germ-free (GF) conditions did not affect the skeletal phenotype,
which supports that tetracyclines’ effects on the maturing skeleton depend on the gut microbiota. Bile acids were
identified as a novel candidate regulator contributing to gut microbiota effects on bone metabolism.
 Bile acids are synthesized in the liver and excreted into the intestine, where bacteria metabolize them. The
intestinal FXR-FGF15 axis is a gut-liver endocrine axis that supports bile acid homeostasis. Bile acid activation
of enterocyte-FXR induces the production of FGF15, which signals at hepatocyte-FGFR4 to inhibit CYP7A1-
mediated bile acid synthesis. Bacteria have unique bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) that differentially deconjugate
bile acids. Conjugation status affects bile acids’ potential to activate FXR. Shifts in intestinal bacteria composition
alter BSHs' deconjugation of bile acids, which can disrupt the intestinal FXR-FGF15 axis.
 Preliminary studies showed that minocycline treatment blunted ileal FGF15 and enhanced hepatic Cyp7a1,
which implies tetracyclines disrupt the intestinal FXR-FGF15 axis. Minocycline increased serum bile acids that
are FXR antagonists, and this altered bile acid profile attenuated osteogenesis in cultured primary osteoblasts.
 Two aims will test the overall hypothesis: Tetracycline-induced gut dysbiosis disrupts the intestinal FXR-
FGF15 axis, which impairs skeletal maturation through dysregulated serum bile acids that attenuate osteoblast-
FXR signaling or reduced serum FGF15 activation of osteoblast-FGFR4 signaling. Aim 1 will utilize metagenomic
approaches and fecal microbiota transfer from SPF to GF mice. Studies will delineate how minocycline- and
doxycycline-induced changes in gut bacteria alter the transformation of intestinal bile acids to affect the FXR-
FGF15 axis. Aim 2 relies on administering an intestinal-specific FXR agonist to define the role of the FXR-FGF15
axis in minocycline effects on the skeleton. Tamoxifen inducible osteoblast null mice will be used to delineate
the role of osteoblast-FXR / osteoblast-FGFR4 in minocycline’s actions suppressing osteogenesis. The proposed
work will define the relationship between tetracycline-induced gut dysbiosis, the FXR-FGF15 axis, osteoblast-
FXR/FGFR4 signaling, and skeletal maturation. Adolescents are commonly prescribed systemic antibiotics for
acne, and >70% receive tetracyclines. Gut and liver conditions have a higher prevalence of osteopenia /
osteoporosis, which underscores the need to define the role of bile acids in gut microbiota effects on bone."
10828856,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and has a high risk of mortality and morbidities. Among the
general AF population, new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common complication after open-
heart surgery, which significantly increased mortality and amplifies hospital and patient costs. The mechanisms
underlying POAF are unclear, thus effective prediction and/or prevention remain unavailable. This proposal aims to
fill this knowledge gap by identifying stress-response kinase JNK as a novel POAF biomarker for surgery patients
and exploring the translational potential of local JNK inhibition in atria as a novel anti-POAF therapeutic
approach. Predisposing factors for POAF include advanced age, binge alcohol, as well as intraoperative and
postoperative atrial injury and/or ischemia. One common element among these factors is tremendously increased
cellular stress, which is known to activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), an important stress-response kinase.
We recently discovered and reported a previously unrecognized causal link between cardiac JNK activation and
abnormal cell-cell communication (via gap junction channels) as well as abnormal Ca triggered activities which
enhance AF propensity. Our intriguing preliminary findings suggest that atrial JNK activation is well correlated to
POAF incidence in patients within 10 days of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, indicating POAF likely
involves JNK activation and possible JNK-driven atrial arrhythmogenesis. Intriguingly, our preliminary results show
for the first time that JNK is present in blood. And JNK activation in the heart increases blood JNK. Accordingly, the
concordant atrial JNK activation and rise in plasma JNK levels correlates nicely to the increased incidence of AF.
Next, we found that most of the plasma JNKs are carried by microparticles (MPs) circulating in the blood. Our pilot
data further suggest that heart cells shed JNK-microparticles (JNK-MPs). All these intriguing preliminary results
combined with our previous findings point to a unique heart-blood JNK relationship that links to AF pathogenesis.
Here, we will use a series of cutting-edge biochemical assays and electrophysiological techniques on surgically
removed intact atrial tissue, isolated atrial myocytes and blood samples from CABG patients and human donor hearts
as well as animal models recapitulating AF risk factors (aging & binge alcohol). Our Specific Aims are: 1) Establish
the electrophysiology & biochemistry profiles of JNK, pro-inflammatory cytokins, and arrhythmic substrates in
atrial tissue/blood of CABG patients and their correlation to POAF incidence; 2) Prove activated JNK in the blood
is a biomarker of POAF risk and test a potential AF therapeutic atrial painting gene transfer intervention in aged
rabbits. Establishing the atrial/blood JNK as a possible biomarker of POAF risk is entirely novel here. Clinical
accessibility for both atrial tissue and blood samples and POAF events make CABG patients an ideal population for
studying the JNK-AF link in humans. Developing an atrial painting gene transfer intervention that could be applied to
high POAF risk patients during surgery is innovative. The unique combination of cardiac research expertise and
novel electrophysiology/biochemistry techniques makes this proposal technically & experimentally innovative."
10909992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the retinal degenerative diseases that affect 9 million Americans, rod and cone photoreceptor dystrophies
are arguably the most devastating. Gene therapy is a potential means to strengthen photoreceptor viability.
However, the first human gene therapy trial for retinal degeneration found improved visual function but did not
slow degeneration of photoreceptors. The goal of this gene therapy-oriented proposal is to determine whether
therapy is achievable in the context of an already diseased retina and at what timepoints gene therapy should be
administered in order to improve functional vision in rod and cone dystrophies.
During the previous funding period, we succeeded in restoring retinal function in mouse model of rod
degeneration, demonstrating that only 12% of resilient photoreceptors are needed for rescue. We now intend to
determine if this threshold may be shifted to an even lower number of resilient photoreceptors (6%) for functional
vision. We will also determine whether cone-specific rescue is possible at late stages of disease. Finally, we will
determine the latest timepoint at which gene therapy can be administered for rod monochromatism. To do this, we
will use a novel, inducible genetic rescue system in the cone-specific G-protein, guanine nucleotide binding α-
transducin 2 (Gnat2), which will allow us to conditionally reverse GNAT2-deficiency while controlling the temporal
and spatial aspects of phenotypic reversal. We will also use a phosphodiesterase 6 (Pde6) mouse as a model for
rod dystrophy.
The Gnat2floxSTOP/ Gnat2floxSTOP::Arr3CreERT2/WT and Pde6floxSTOP/PdefloxSTOP::Arr3CreERT2/WT programmable models will
provide a platform for contributing to ongoing efforts aimed at increasing restoration of visual function following
gene therapy for rod- and cone-mediated dystrophies. They will also allow us to address several compelling,
clinically relevant questions: Is the brain’s circuitry sufficiently plastic to recover from the pathological changes
caused by the Gnat2 mutation? Is there a point of no return after which, despite reversion of the genotype to
wild type, cones cannot be salvaged? Can temporal barriers to gene therapy be relieved by metabolic
reprogramming?
Taken together, this proposal is certain to 1) define the factors limiting interventional therapy; 2) validate a new,
inducible models of rod- and cone-mediated retinal degeneration; and 3) determine whether metabolic
reprogramming can serve as an efficacious, non-gene-specific strategy for treating retinal degeneration."

In low- and middle-income countries ~2.8 billion people are exposed daily to smoke from cooking fires, termed
household air pollution (HAP), resulting in an estimated 2.3M deaths and 91.4M DALYs in 2019. A large
proportion of HAP-attributable deaths and DALYs are due to respiratory disease. Establishment of ideal lung
health in childhood is critical to reduce risk for future respiratory disease. We hypothesize that prenatal to age
1 exposure to HAP impairs lung health and programs future disease risk. We further hypothesize that higher
mucin gene expression in response to HAP exposure is a key biological mechanism, and that genotypes that
exhibit a stronger mucin response to HAP are more susceptible to HAP exposure. We propose to build on an
existing pregnancy cohort in Ghana – the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study, or GRAPHS – to
assess how prenatal to age one HAP exposure affects lung health through age 13 years. We will use well-
established, validated methods to assess these outcomes. In the long run, our research will help build the
evidence base for cost effective interventions to improve health by reducing HAP exposure."
10881880,"Abstract:
Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of complex neurological conditions impacting the
genesis and maintenance of myelin, or white matter. Next generation sequencing and emerging
genomic technologies have improved the ability to identify molecular causes of disease, allowing for
the improved characterization of disease processes and focused therapeutics. However, molecular
characterization of leukodystrophies requires expert oversight as much of the current gene-disease
validation and clinical actionability have not been formally characterized. Current diagnostic testing
includes biochemical and genetic testing but reveals a diagnosis in only 50-80% of patients said to
have a myelin disorder by brain magnetic resonance imaging. This leaves many patients with an
uncertain diagnosis, which can limit treatment options, cause emotional distress, and limit access to
clinical trials and, for some families, reproductive choices. The Global Leukodystrophy Initiative
(GLIA) is a Rare Disease Clinical Research Network funded consortium of scientists and advocates
that work collaboratively to advance the study of and clinical trials for leukodystrophies. The GLIA
consortium has approached ClinGen to establish Gene and Variant Curation Expert Panels, using our
disease-specific experts and bioinformaticians to curate and assess leukodystrophy-related genes
and variants. There are at least 240 genes that currently fall in the purview of this group, which will be
expertly curated and managed by this group. For the 25 most commonly diagnosed genes causing
leukodystrophy, this group will provide comprehensive variant curation, including the most clinically
actionable disease-causing variants. The overall impact of this application will be to clarify the
disease-gene association in the leukodystrophies, improve understanding of clinical actionability in
these disorders, and clarify the pathogenicity of variants in key high frequency genes. Together, these
activities will provide the leukodystrophy community with diagnostic clarity for newborn screening,
clinical trials and clinical care."

Prostate cancer information shared through popular social networks such as YouTube, Instagram and TikTok is
widely viewed but misinformation is common. This has important implications for informed decision-making and
quality of life. Exposure to misinformation is an understudied and potentially modifiable contributor to health
inequities in prostate cancer among Black and Hispanic men. The U.S. Surgeon General recently issued an
advisory that spread of misinformation is a serious threat to public health, calling for more research to tackle
misinformation. We will address this research gap through three key approaches: (1) We will examine the most
common types of misinformation being shared about prostate cancer through social media in English and
Spanish. (2) We will also explore how Black and Hispanic men determine whether prostate cancer information
is trustworthy. (3) We will conduct a randomized trial to test the efficacy of a general media literacy intervention
and a health literacy intervention to reduce trust in misinformative prostate cancer content among Black and
Hispanic adults. Our multi-disciplinary team is well-suited to lead this study with expertise in prostate cancer
clinical care, biostatistics, epidemiology, health literacy, health equity, and social media. Our advisory board
includes multi-disciplinary patients, experts and community leaders, all of whom will be involved in all stages of
the research design and in the public dissemination of results. The expected outcomes of this study will advance
the field and promote health equity by studying ways to address the widespread dissemination of misinformation
about prostate cancer."

 Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an incurable disease that is expected to
account for ~ 34,500 deaths each year in the United States. Therapeutic options are limited for mCRPC
patients that extend life. There is an urgent need for developing novel targeted therapies, especially
personalized therapies based on genomic alterations in tumors. Recent genomic studies have revealed a
variety of actionable molecular targets with underlying genomic alterations. Notably, alterations in genes
involved in DNA damage response (DDR) are among the most common genetic events and enriched in
mCRPC. These alterations have been correlated with particular therapeutic vulnerabilities in prostate cancer
(PCa) cells. Specifically, defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) would predict sensitivity to
inhibition of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are a new type of targeted
therapy, which works by preventing the enzyme PARP from repairing damaged DNA in tumor cells. BRCA1/2
encode proteins essential for HRR. Cancer cells lacking BRCA1/2 depend instead on PARP-regulated DNA
repair and are hypersensitive to PARPis. The U.S. FDA has approved two PARP inhibitors (olaparib and
rucaparib) for treatment of mCRPC patients with HRR mutations (or deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations) based on
the results from recent clinical trials.
 One of the major barriers to effective treatment using PARPis is how to select patients who most likely
benefit from PARP inhibition. BRCA1/2 mutations can predict PARPi response with 50-60% accuracy.
However, the degree to which patients with non-BCRA1/2 genomic alterations respond to PARPis remains
unclear. Through genome-wide CRISPR screening, we have recently discovered that loss of MMS22L in PCa
cells predicts the response to PARP inhibition. MMS22L is required for HRR of replication fork-associated DNA
double strand breaks. More importantly, the MMS22L gene is frequently deleted (~14%) in prostate tumors. In
addition, the results from our CRISPR screening further suggest that loss of TP53 or RB1 may render PCa
cells resistance to PARPis due to upregulation of HRR gene expression, which can be overcome by combining
ATR inhibition. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine (1) to what extent loss of MMS22L confers a
cellular response to PARP inhibition in preclinical PCa models; (2) to what extent inactivation of TP53 or RB1
influences PARPi response; (3) to what extent ATR inhibition re-sensitizes resistant PCa cells to PARP
inhibition. The successful completion of this project will set the stage for future clinical trials in mCRPC patients
with MMS22L and TP53/RB1 alterations and significantly expand the pool of eligible patients for PARP
inhibition."

Core B will provide essential support for the projects to achieve their specific aims while addressing the central
hypothesis of the program project, which is that “protein glycosylation and glycoprotein remodeling alter the
coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis"".Core B will analyze blood or plasma samples from mice, patients
with sepsis, and healthy human volunteers generated from the projects to detect any changes in the cellular
components (hematology), chemical composition (Chemistry), and hemostatic status (Coagulation) that may
take place in different experimental or clinical conditions.Core B will use defined panels of assays as an
efficient way to detect potentially significant changes in experimental versus control studies. These panels are:
1. Hematology: Complete blood count with white cell subsets (differential count) and microscopic examination
of peripheral blood smears for cellular morphology; 2. Chemistry: serum electrolytes, total protein, IgG
immunoglobulin, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP), and optionally lipids (LDL, HDL, TG) to evaluate the overall
functions of the liver, pancreas, and kidney, as well as the general metabolic status; 3. Hemostasis: von
Willebrand antigen (primary hemostasis), PT, APTT, clotting factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, fibrinogen,
and D-dimer or FDPs (coagulation), protein C, protein S, and antithrombin (anticoagulation), and antiplasmin
(fibrinolysis). Additional tests that have been standardized in Core B such as thrombin-antithrombin complex,
heparin anticoagulant activities, plasma tissue factor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, whole blood platelet
aggregometry and whole blood thromboelastograph will be available to all projects as needed.During the past
four years, Core B has successfully used this approach to generate data of significant import to the program

The Core C facility supports research addressing the specific aims of the projects to include the planning and
execution of experimental sepsis cohort studies, hematological analyses of whole blood samples, and
measurements of multiple circulating glycoproteins that includes comparative studies of markers of
inflammatory processes during the onset and progression of sepsis. The Core thereby provides support
addressing the central hypothesis of the program, Protein glycosylation and glycoprotein remodeling alter the
coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. Core C provides essential experimental and technological
capabilities that include the analysis of experimental and clinical biological samples derived from mouse and
human species including whole blood, serum, plasma, and, when requested, urine. In collaboration with the
projects, and as published, the core has developed an experimental sepsis protocol in the mouse that includes
standardized and reproducible pathogen infection and monitoring with specific thresholds for data inclusion
representing the onset and progression of mouse sepsis in response to five different human bacterial
pathogens and clinical isolates. This approach has enabled comparative studies spanning the specific aims of
each of the three projects while revealing the presence of different pathogenic pathways that provide a degree
of stratification in the pathogenesis of sepsis due to specific bacterial pathogens. These studies will be further
expanded as indicated in the research projects of this application. In addition, the core facility will complete
hematology analyses of mouse blood samples as well as blood from human volunteers and sepsis patients to
include measurements of white and red blood cells, hematocrit values, hemoglobin abundance, and multiple
platelet metrics. Additional analyses when requested will include flow cytometric studies of cell abundance
representing various blood cell lineages including T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils,
and basophils. These hematology analyses will be provided to onsite local project researchers and will be
standardized with identical equipment that is used to undertake comparable hematology analyses at the

plasma, or urine samples from mouse and human species in the context of health and sepsis. These multiplex
experiments use investigator-selected and customizable assays yielding quantitative measurements of
essential and important cytokines, growth factors, and various other biological indicators of physiological
systems especially those that impinge upon inflammatory processes. Over a thousand proteins can be
selectively measured in various sets of analytes, and many of these proteins are found at low abundance and
cannot be routinely detected and accurately measured using mass spectrometry. The core thereby provides a
means to query lower abundance proteins that are difficult to quantify otherwise. Core C will enhance the rate
of progress of program research and facilitate research integration and synergies among the studies proposed."

The Proteomics Core facility (Core D) will support the proposed projects to address the central hypothesis of the
program; protein glycosylation and glycoprotein remodeling alter the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis.
Core D uses state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to analyze plasma and cellular proteomes in sepsis. Core D has
made essential contributions to the progress of the P01 during the first funding cycle, providing important findings
in support of all three research projects, and findings that led to two publications, one in Nature Communications.
The Specific Aims of Core D are to: 1) Assess time and pathogen-dependent changes to the Plasma Proteome
resulting from sepsis, 2) Characterize the time and pathogen-dependent remodeling of the vascular surface
proteome, and 3) Determine the molecular basis of enhanced consumption coagulopathy exhibited during Gram-
negative sepsis.
Aim 1 focuses on plasma proteomics for all three projects. Project 1 will use plasma proteomics to identify
specific glycosidases, their glycoprotein substrates, and endocytic lectin receptors and determine their impact of
their homeostatic regulation on the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. Project 2 will use plasma
proteomics to identify components and mechanisms of both the pathogen and host determining virulence and
sepsis pathogenesis and determine their utility in the stratification and prognosis of experimental and human
sepsis. Project 3 will use plasma proteomics to determine vascular surface marker shedding into circulation in
murine models of sepsis, and their impact in the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis while identifying
mechanistic links that may enable human disease stratification and prognosis.
Aim 2 focuses on characterizing the vascular surface proteome in support of Project 3. This work will characterize
organ-specific changes to vascular cell surface proteomes and determine their impact in the coagulopathy and
inflammation of sepsis and their utility in the stratification and prognosis of human disease.
Aim 3 will support Project 2 in seeking to characterize the enhanced consumption coagulopathy exhibited during
Gram-negative sepsis. This work will use activity-based proteomics and standard protein fractionation analysis
to identify bacterial function(s) responsible for the observed FXI-stimulatory activity present in SC/ST/EC
supernatants; and determine its role in the elevated consumption coagulopathy in Gram-negative sepsis and
possible utility in the stratification and prognosis of human disease."
10849807,"SUMMARY
Coagulopathy and inflammation are the primary contributors to organ failure and patient death in sepsis.
Among the top five causes of human mortality worldwide, the number of sepsis cases diagnosed annually now
exceeds that of cancer. Among survivors, many suffer lifelong debilitation with cognitive decline from the
extensive vascular damage of the host response. Decades of failure in the development of effective
therapeutics for sepsis are reflected by the continuing high rate of patient mortality while many billions of
dollars of healthcare costs are expended annually. It has become evident that a greater mechanistic
understanding is needed regarding the molecular pathophysiology of this deadly syndrome. This project
addresses this need with proposed research of a recently discovered mechanism of glycoprotein remodeling,
senescence, and clearance that participates in disparate pathways modulating the coagulopathy and
inflammation in sepsis. We have linked the step-wise post-translational remodeling of nascent blood
glycoproteins by multiple glycosidases to increased protein age in circulation and to the formation of ligands for
endocytic lectin receptors. This process normally determines the half-lives and functions of multiple blood
components. Rates of this remodeling are altered in sepsis and among different blood components often linked
to pathogen identity. Increased rates of remodeling rapidly change the abundance and functions of key
glycoproteins including anti-inflammatory enzymes, coagulation factors, and platelets. Our findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that sepsis is not a singular disease mechanism and may be further understood
and stratified by analyzing alterations in host glycoprotein remodeling in the context of discrete pathogen
identities and associated toxins. This may have important implications for designing future therapeutic
approaches. The aims of this project encompass this perspective and the central hypothesis of the program:
Protein glycosylation and glycoprotein remodeling alter the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. Research
proposed herein includes the identification and characterization of glycosidases and lectin receptors in the
blood and vascular systems contributing to blood component modulation and mechanisms of coagulopathy
and inflammation in sepsis. Blood glycoproteins desialylated by host Neu1 and Neu3 neuraminidases will be
identified and characterized including those targeted for increased endocytic clearance in sepsis. The related
process of platelet aging and clearance and its increase in sepsis will be further investigated. Recent findings
demonstrate a mysterious collaborative interaction between the Ashwell-Morell receptor of hepatocytes and
the macrophage galactose lectin of Kupffer cells. This project will also continue to acquire and analyze medical
records and blood samples provided by human sepsis patients and volunteers to achieve further translational
links yielding mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic insights. These enzymes and receptors together
contribute to distinct and overlapping molecular pathways in the stratification and pathogenesis of sepsis."
10849809,"Project Summary
The aims address the central hypothesis of the overall program: Protein glycosylation and glycoprotein
remodeling alter the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. Proposed research is based on the emerging
hallmark of sepsis whereby natural selection imposed by the immune system results in the generation of
hypervirulent strain variants with increased risk of invasive disease. Hypervirulence is believed to arise from a
combination of pathogen-specific determinants and host responses. Over the last grant cycle, we have
demonstrated that host responses to experimental sepsis occur by multiple mechanisms including alterations
in blood glycoprotein remodeling. Proposed research focuses on the role of hypervirulent bacteria and host
glycoprotein remodeling responses leading to accelerated onset and progression of coagulation abnormalities
and inflammation of sepsis. This project utilizes the combined expertise of the Project Leaders and Core
Directors in the pathophysiology of sepsis, including coagulation, inflammation, proteomics and glycobiology
and engages all of the core facilities of the program. The Project Leader discovered hypervirulent Salmonella
Choleraesuis (SC) clinical isolates that are among the most virulent Salmonella found in nature. SC typically
causes sepsis or extra-intestinal infections in humans yet is closely related to the common food-poisoning
pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). We have shown that in experimental ST and E. coli sepsis, reduced
blood levels of anti-inflammatory alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzymes result from pathogen-selective host
responses – induction of neuraminidase activities (Neu) and resultant AP desialylation, and clearance by the
Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR). AP reductions diminish LPS de-toxification thereby increasing inflammation
and mortality. In contrast, our recent findings indicate that SC does not induce Neu activities nor AP clearance,
but AMR deficiency remains protective, implicating the involvement of other host glycoproteins, and their
identification may reveal new pathways and mechanisms modulating hypervirulence and sepsis. Additional
preliminary data suggest that SC elicits an increased pro-inflammatory state due to diminished levels of host
induction of IL-10, an immune modulatory cytokine that affects sepsis disease outcome. Further, stratification
of experimental and human sepsis caused by Gram-negative pathogens may include pathogen-selective
modulation of Factor XI activity in circulation. Proposed research will identify and investigate environmental,
genetic, and proteomic mechanisms determining hypervirulence including the AMR, IL-10, and coagulation
Factor XI, and their utility in the stratification and prognosis of experimental and human sepsis. The
overarching goal is to identify components and mechanisms of both the pathogen and host determining
virulence and sepsis pathogenesis, leading to diagnostic biomarker discovery and rational design of
therapeutic agents that have eluded discovery for decades."

The aims of Project 3 address the central hypothesis of the overall program: Protein glycosylation and
glycoprotein remodeling alter the coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. Project 3 will investigate remodeling
of the vascular glycocalyx induced by sepsis and how these changes affect host response and survival in mice.
The proposed research engages all of the core facilities of the program and draws on the combined expertise of
the Project Leaders and Core Leaders in infection and sepsis, inflammatory biology, coagulation, proteomics
and glycobiology. From recent literature and preliminary data, it is well known that sepsis induces changes in
the composition of plasma glycoproteins and shedding of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx, leading to vascular
dysfunction and high mortality. However, little information is available about the composition of the vascular
proteome and glycoproteome and how it changes in response to different infectious agents. Over the last grant
cycle, we developed an in vivo tagging method that allows assessment of the vascular proteome in different
organs. We showed that infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MR) results in remodeling of
the vascular proteome in an organ-specific manner, leading to the discovery of proteoglycan 4 and factors that
modulate hyaluronan metabolism as potential novel markers of infection. We also showed that heparan sulfate
produced by the vascular endothelium plays an important role in determining the severity and outcome of sepsis
in mice. In the liver, undersulfation of endothelial heparan sulfate protects against the inflammatory response
and coagulopathy induced by MR. However, in the heart, pathological changes take place that correlate with
hypersensitivity to Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin, a key virulence factor. In the next cycle, we will
expand the in vivo tagging method to include other common bacterial pathogens that cause sepsis in humans in
order to identify operative pathogenic mechanisms and to determine if sepsis can be stratified by responses in
the vascular wall to different pathogens. We will examine the mechanism by which heparan sulfate modulates
alpha-hemolysin sensitivity. We will determine if the induction of proteoglycan 4 and hyaluronan metabolism are
general hallmarks of sepsis and if these factors serve a protective role. We also showed that proteoglycan 4 and
hyaluronan accumulate in human plasma samples from patients with sepsis. We will correlate these markers
with clinical information about the patients to determine if these markers stratify sepsis and whether they have
value as diagnostic or prognostic markers. The overarching goal is to understand if infection-induced remodeling
of the vascular glycoproteome provides a window to identify disease mechanisms and a way to stratify sepsis
across time, different infectious agents, and during disease resolution."

Each protein consists of numerous different molecular entities, termed proteoforms. These different forms arise
from post-translation modifications, alternative, and genetic mutations among others. Proteoforms can have
different biological function, alternations can cause disease, and they can serve as highly specific biomarkers.
Proteoform analysis is, therefore, an important frontier in biomedical research. Progress is slow, however,
because current technology is inadequate. On one hand, better high-performance protein measurement tools
are needed for some applications to reach ever deeper into the proteoform. On the other hand, faster and simpler
tools are needed for other applications to scale up proteoform research and increase participation in the field by
scientists who are not protein mass spectrometry (MS) specialists. To that end, this proposal aims to develop
self-contained analytical devices (‘cartridges’) that combines all of the components necessary to analyze both
intact proteins and proteolytic peptides. The cartridge will include an antibody-based preconcentration system,
an immobilized enzyme to perform protein digestion if desired, and a built-in substrate to perform protein
ionization by electrospray. The cartridge will allow the entirety of the protein analysis workflow to occur
automatically on a single device that can be directly coupled to the mass spectrometer. All of these processes will
be designed to work without external pumping or other complex systems for sample handling. In Aim 1, a device
will be developed that combines affinity-based protein purification with a porous material to perform
electrospray ionization (substrate-supported electrospray ionization or ssESI). Proteoforms captured by the
affinity material will be eluted onto the ionization material for immediate detection using top-down mass
spectrometry. In Aim 2, an enzymatic digestion step will be integrated into the analysis cartridge to enable
detection of proteoforms at the peptide level. While digestion of proteoforms has disadvantages, it does enable
more sensitive detection and better sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. In Aim 3, electrophoretic
methods will be developed to separate and stack proteoforms on the ionization substrate. The electrophoretic
manipulations will be designed to occur in minutes. Separations will be mainly designed to reduce or eliminate
ion suppression, while stacking will be done to improve detection limits."

The summary/abstract did not require alteration 
The leading cause of acute liver injury and acute liver failure in the United States is hepatotoxicity caused by overdose of the pain medication acetaminophen (APAP). Even with available treatments (i.e., N-acetylcysteine), more than half of APAP overdose patients require costly hospitalization and antiquated standards to guide treatment. APAP overdose patients would benefit most from treatments that prevent the progression of simple hepatotoxicity to liver failure. Using robust experimental settings and results from acute liver failure patients, our team uncovered a novel pathway whereby macrophage elastase (MMP-12) prevents progression of hepatotoxicity to ALF by reducing excess production of the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin. The current view is that plasmin production in the APAP-injured liver is controlled by standard proteins involved in blood clot lysis. However, our strong preliminary studies suggest that, in contrast to the current paradigm, hepatic plasmin generation is controlled locally by direct MMP-12-dependent proteolysis of the plasminogen zymogen. The central hypothesis framing these studies is macrophage elastase (MMP-12) prevents vascular damage and intrahepatic congestion after APAP overdose by cleaving plasminogen at a site that releases the anti-inflammatory factor angiostatin while preventing formation of active plasmin. Our approach includes genetically-modified mice with deficiency in components of the signaling pathway controlling MMP-12 expression, mice expressing plasminogen with an active site mutation that prevents plasmin activity, novel lipid nanoparticles to superimpose plasminogen deficiency in experimental APAP hepatotoxicity, and leading edge N-degradomics to pinpoint plasmin substrates in the injured liver. The established investigative team comprises experts in APAP-induced liver injury and repair, biochemistry/function of the fibrinolytic system, vascular pathology, leading-edge proteomic analysis, and experimental settings of liver disease. In our proposed studies we will: define the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving MMP-12 expression after acetaminophen overdose (Aim 1); determine the mechanisms whereby MMP-12 prevents pathologic vascular congestion in the acetaminophen-injured liver (Aim 2); and determine the role of plasmin(ogen) proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions in APAP-induced liver injury (Aim 3). The expected outcome of these Specific Aims is the discovery of a novel mechanistic link between leukocyte effector function (i.e., MMP-12 expression) and prevention of intrahepatic hyperfibrinolysis in the injured liver, including evidence of a novel molecular mechanism controlling plasmin generation. This could pinpoint mechanistic biomarkers to predict imminent hepatic vascular dysfunction in the injured liver and to uncover therapeutic modalities to prevent hepatic congestion after hepatotoxicant exposure. By virtue of separation from traditional regulation of fibrinolysis, this could greatly improve outcome in APAP overdose without increasing bleeding risk."
10808943,"Project Summary
The goal of the proposed work is to create a new synthetic biology-based platform for protein
diagnostics. The specific context motivating this challenge is the need to measure protein
biomarkers indicative of micronutrient deficiencies in a minimal-equipment fashion. Current
diagnostics for nutritional deficiencies are infeasible at the required population scale due to cost
and logistical constraints, and so a point-of-care, minimal-equipment, field-deployable approach
is needed to help nutritional epidemiologists get the information they need to better allocate limited
intervention resources. However, the impact of such a technology would go well beyond nutritional
epidemiology and diagnostics, as proteins are common biomarkers for many other diseases and
conditions. Thus, the same technology could be translated to global health applications and
screening for other diseases in resource-poor locations. In addition, it could also enable better
diagnostic monitoring for neonatal intensive care unit patients by overcoming limitations on daily
allowable blood draw volumes.
The use of a split protein reporter system coupled with a cell-free protein expression system is
proposed to accomplish this goal. In the presence of a specific protein, the split reporter system
reassembles and the reaction undergoes a colorimetric change. The entire approach requires
minimal to no equipment and would be inexpensive, making it perfectly suited for use in the low-
resource regions that are most prominently affected by nutritional deficiencies. There is strong
preliminary data supporting the likelihood of success for this approach. To achieve these goals,
three aims are proposed. First, the existing proof of principle sensor will be advanced with a model
protein target and the impact of sensor design choices on sensor functionality and performance
will be characterized. The second aim entails demonstrating the approach’s generalizability by
developing at least three sensors for clinically relevant proteins. The third aim involves advancing
the assay towards a truly field-deployable state by testing it for functionality in a human serum
matrix, implementing a calibration approach, demonstrating functionality after lyophilization, and
developing a companion smartphone app to support output interpretation.
This project will yield the underlying technology that can be used for the first-ever synthetic
biology-based, quantitative protein detection assay for low-resource settings. By being low-cost,
essentially point-of-care, and easily generalizable to other protein targets, such a long-term result
would potentially improve the health of millions of people worldwide."
10844565,"Abstract
Degenerative retinal diseases represent an enormous public health burden and demand innovative strategies to
replace retinal neurons. Ideal solutions will overcome innate barriers associated with terminal differentiation to
endogenously regenerate retinal neurons. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells hold promise for this
application, as these cells can reprogram to produce neural retina in embryonic amniotes. For reasons that are
not well understood, RPE cells lose neural competence during early amniotic development. The present study
proposes to comprehensively map the gene regulatory landscape of RPE at plastic stages of development and
to probe the molecular barriers to reprogramming that emerge as these cells differentiate. RPE cells of the
chicken are plastic at embryonic day 4 (E4) and can be reprogrammed to neural retina following retinectomy and
treatment with FGF2. However, by embryonic day 5 (E5), RPE cell fate becomes restricted and reprogramming
capacity is abrogated. Previous studies have demonstrated that E4 RPE cells reprogram through the activation
of neural retina transcription factors, such as VSX2, SIX6, and PAX6, and the simultaneous repression of RPE
differentiation programs. Concomitantly, an epigenetic reprogramming event resets DNA methylation and poises
chromatin into a more active configuration to facilitate the ensuing change in cell identity. However, it is not
understood how transcription factor networks interact with a dynamic chromatin landscape to determine RPE
neural competence. Our preliminary evidence suggests that pro-neural genes remain comparably inducible in
the E5 RPE, but that an incipient RPE differentiation program serves as an inherent barrier to neural identity at
this stage. This differentiation program is led by the RPE transcription factors MITF and OTX2, and distinct
accessibility footprints from these factors are observable in the chromatin landscape. The current proposal will
build on these findings by mapping genome-wide epigenetic patterns associated with RPE competence
restriction, including DNA and histone modifications that have been previously demonstrated to facilitate RPE
reprogramming (Aim 1). Additionally, RPE differentiation and reprogramming will be profiled at a single cell
resolution, enabling the precise identification of transcriptomic features that delineate plastic and fate restricted
RPE (Aim 2). In parallel, the DNA binding activity of key effector transcription factors, such as MITF and OTX2,
will be profiled across the RPE at different stages of differentiation or reprogramming. These factors, as well as
key transcriptional targets, will be perturbed using CRISPR-Cas9 with the intention of recovering RPE neural
competence at more advanced stages of differentiation (Aim 3). Together, these findings will provide an
expansive view of chromatin states associated with RPE competence restriction, while simultaneously probing
the chromatin – transcription factor interactions that drive the observed phenotypes. These results will provide
imperative insights toward understanding RPE differentiation and the potentiality of this cell type for use in neuron
replacement strategies."
10849791,"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness for which the lowering of intraocular pressure
(IOP) is the only proven treatment. Since elevated IOP is a critical risk factor for glaucoma, several animal models
have been developed to study the cellular, vascular, and electrophysiologic responses of the retina to acute IOP
elevation. While these models have elucidated the relationship between ocular perfusion and retinal function as
well as many of the cellular pathways activated in response to acute IOP related exposure, there are significant
differences in optic nerve structure and composition across species, limiting the translation of these findings to
the human disease. This project will study the impact of IOP elevation in the living human eye for the first time
by utilizing the unique resources developed by the Living Eye Project. This project provides experimental access
to the human eye in vivo in research-consented brain-dead organ donors prior to organ procurement. Following
enucleation, the Living Eye Project provides access to the same eyes for ex vivo analysis of cellular and tissue
responses. Our principal hypothesis is that acute IOP elevation results in deformation of the optic nerve head
(ONH), and this deformation drives mechanosensitive mechanisms within the lamina cribrosa (LC) and
peripapillary sclera that initiate pathologic remodeling of the LC, which injures the axons of retinal ganglion cells
traversing this mechanically dynamic region. These mechanosensitive pathways will be characterized using
spatial transcriptomics for the first time in the human eye alongside immunohistochemistry and protein analysis.
We predict that increased IOP initiates a profibrotic, inflammatory phenotype and transcriptomic alterations that
regionally colocalize with the connective tissue density within the LC and are associated with the magnitude of
IOP-induced deformation of the ONH measured in vivo. Our unprecedented opportunity to measure structural
and biomechanical parameters of the human ONH in vivo and perform ex vivo evaluation of the cellular
mechanobiology of the same tissues will provide the first direct experimental link between ONH mechanical
strain and the molecular and cellular responses of ONH tissues that drive remodeling, which is critical to the
development and progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Defining this “mechanotranscriptome” in the
human ONH will critically assess the translational value of animal models for studying mechanotransduction as
well as define the human cellular and molecular mechanisms of ONH remodeling needed to guide the
development of novel therapeutics designed to enhance the resilience of the ONH to pressure-related stress."

A major function of the lymphatic system is fluid transport, which is critical for fluid homeostasis, lipid transport
and metabolism, and the transport of immune cells and pro-inflammatory molecules. Lymphatic vessels contract
spontaneously to pump fluid, while intraluminal one-way valves ensure net forward flow. Our group and others
have shown that obesity and metabolic syndrome can cause different forms of lymphatic vascular dysfunction.
In fact, this connection is a dysfunction- and disease-promoting feedback loop, as lymphatic dysfunction also
contributes to obesity. This suggests pharmacological improvement of lymphatic function as a potential
therapeutic alternative in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Relevant to this proposal, transient receptor potential
vanilloid 4 (Trpv4) channels are key regulators of vascular function, and their activity is dysregulated in various
inflammatory diseases, including obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the role of Trpv4 channels in
regulating lymphatic vascular function in health and disease remains unexplored. Our preliminary studies
show that overactivity of Trpv4 channels in a variety of cell types within and around the lymphatic wall is
detrimental to different aspects of the function of the lymphatic vasculature, including impairment of contractility
and compromised barrier function. Importantly, partial deficiency of Trpv4 channels in the lymphatic endothelium
prevented significant impairment of lymphatic function upon stimulation of Trpv4 channels. Trpv4 channels have
also been implicated in regulatory mechanisms of tissue fibrosis via activation of the Plasminogen Activator
Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix. PAI-1 is an important biomarker for disease,
fibrosis, and inflammation. We recently showed that PAI-1 is significantly increased in the lymphatic vasculature
of diet-induced obese mice; and globally deficient PAI-1 mice are significantly protected against diet-induced
obesity and metabolic dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In line with the
emerging significant role of the lymphatic system in lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that, in obesity and
metabolic syndrome, increased PAI-1 can be a key modulator of Trpv4 overactivity, and this is
detrimental for lymphatic vascular function, which reciprocally exacerbates obesity. We propose
evaluating PAI-1 as a long-term therapeutic alternative for direct or indirect modulation of Trpv4 activity. We
anticipate that reducing inflammation and fibrosis via PAI-1 inhibition will decrease direct activation of Trpv4
channels in two ways, 1) by decreasing inflammatory molecules; and 2) by reducing stiffening of the extracellular
matrix, and therefore decreasing stretch-mediated activation. As important regulators of inflammatory responses,
dual targeting of Trpv4 and PAI-1 may offer synergistic therapeutic benefits, to be evaluated in this proposal.
This project will provide fundamental information about Trpv4 channels in the regulation of lymphatic vascular
function and will identify the role of lymphatic Trpv4 channels in obesity and metabolic syndrome."

Exposure to environmental chemicals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes (T2D)
and metabolic syndrome (MetS) as these exposures are widespread in the population, and the prevalence of
these metabolic disorders has dramatically increased over the past several decades. In the US, >42,000 types
of chemicals are actively produced, but only a handful of chemicals are tested for their toxicity. Epidemiologic
studies have also been restricted to a few targeted metabolism-disrupting chemicals, while relatively little is
known about the potential metabolic toxicity of the majority of these chemicals. Analyses spanning wide
classes of chemicals are critically needed to identify novel areas of risk, as well as specific associations with
metabolic phenotypes. In addition, the underlying biological mechanisms linking environmental chemicals and
T2D and MetS are still not well understood. Although risk assessment is critical for early detection and
prevention of T2D and MetS, current risk prediction models generally use only a few known risk factors such
as demographics, clinical measures including fasting blood glucose and body mass index, and family history
and susceptible genotypes. Integrated exposomic signatures may improve risk stratification/discrimination to
identify vulnerable populations and provide a more effective intervention approach at the individual- and
population-level (i.e., precision health). To address these scientific gaps, we propose to conduct an exposome-
metabolome wide association study in relation to incident T2D and Mets in the Study of Women’s Health
Across the Nation (SWAN), a multi-racial/ethnic longitudinal cohort of women from midlife to late-life. Using
untargeted, high-resolution mass spectrometry that provides the high-quality measures needed for sequencing
the human blood exposome, we aim to establish a new paradigm for environmental health research
addressing metabolic disease risk. This can be achieved by taking advantage of the rich longitudinal features
of the SWAN. Specifically, we aim to 1) conduct an integrated exposome- and metabolome-wide association
study of incident T2D and MetS using pre-diagnosis blood samples collected at baseline to characterize known
and novel environmental exposures detected using untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry linked to
future T2D and MetS risk and identify endogenous metabolite and disease-associated alterations underlying
T2D and MetS; 2) evaluate temporal evolution of exposome and metabolome profiles in T2D and MetS cases
and metabolically healthy controls; 3) identify pre-diagnostic metabolomic signatures that link targeted
exposures of metabolism disrupting chemicals and novel exposome biomarkers to incident T2D and MetS; and
4) develop and validate exposome-based risk prediction models for T2D and MetS. Successful completion of
these aims will identify critical pre-diagnostic exposome biomarkers that may improve risk prediction for T2D
and MetS."
10817087,"Blood-brain barrier dysfunction is both a cause and consequence of seizures in patients with epilepsy, yet ther-
apeutic options to repair barrier dysfunction do not exist. Key characteristics of barrier dysfunction in epilepsy
are neurovascular inflammation and barrier leakage, both result from seizure-mediated release of glutamate.
Data support that an inflamed and leaky, and thus, dysfunctional barrier contributes to seizure genesis through
a pernicious feedback loop that promotes epilepsy progression. However, current therapeutic options to treat
epilepsy are largely neuron-centric and do not address barrier dysfunction. In addition, existing antiseizure drugs
(ASDs) do not reliably control all seizures, leaving patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies prone to uncontrolled
seizures. We recently discovered that Cannabidiol (CBD) mitigates barrier dysfunction in epilepsy. We also found
that CBD blocks glutamate-mediated barrier leakage in isolated capillaries and repairs seizure-induced barrier
dysfunction in vivo. These findings suggest that CBD has the potential to block the feedback signaling that drives
barrier dysfunction and seizure progression in epilepsy. However, data that support the use of CBD to repair
barrier dysfunction in epilepsy are not available. This knowledge gap represents a critical unmet need that pre-
vents us from achieving therapeutic advances for patients with epilepsy. The overall objective in this application
is to define the mechanistic link between cannabinoid signaling and barrier dysfunction to explain observed CBD
effects and to evaluate CBD as therapeutic agent to repair barrier dysfunction in epilepsy. Based on preliminary
data the central hypothesis of this project is that CBD repairs barrier dysfunction thereby lowering seizure burden
in epilepsy. The rationale for the proposed research is that its successful completion will provide mechanistic
and preclinical data supporting future research for the clinical translation of CBD to treat patients with epilepsy.
The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Describe cannabinoid signaling in glutamate-
mediated barrier dysfunction and 2) Evaluate CBD for its potential to repair barrier dysfunction in epilepsy. Under
Aim 1, we will describe key mechanistic steps between cannabinoid signaling and glutamate-mediated barrier
dysfunction by using brain capillaries isolated from knockout mouse models. We will verify these signaling steps
in isolated human brain capillaries. Under Aim 2, we will evaluate the therapeutic benefit of CBD on seizure-
mediated neurovascular inflammation, barrier leakage, and seizure burden in chronic epileptic rats. The pro-
posed research is innovative, because it focuses on a thus far unaddressed topic: cannabinoid signaling at the
blood-brain barrier and CBD as therapeutic agent to repair barrier dysfunction and reduce seizures in epilepsy.
The proposed research is significant because it holds the promise of a novel therapeutic approach to repair
barrier dysfunction that has translational potential to advance treatment of patients with epilepsy and other sei-
zure disorders with underlying barrier dysfunction."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts over 6.5 million Americans.
Despite decades of research on amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau lesions, effective treatment remains out of reach.
Mounting AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk loci provide opportunities for understanding
disease biology and developing effective treatment. Multiple AD GWAS risk genes, such as APOE, are pivotal
for lipid metabolism that is essential to brain health and disease. Under stress or in the aging brain, both
astrocytes and microglia show abnormal lipid metabolism and accumulation of lipid droplets (LD). Although
glial LD are known to be largely neuroprotective, LD formation in human neurons and its cellular and molecular
ramifications are less clear. With excitatory neurons (Ex) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC), we have shown that APOE4 Ex neurons co-cultured with astrocytes accumulated more LD than
APOE2/3 neurons. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of AD brain also identified an impaired neuron-
oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) communication mediated by APOE and its receptor LDLR. Interestingly,
neural cholesterol was recently found to be essential to OPC proliferation and remyelination. We thus
hypothesize that abnormal neuronal LD and cholesterol in AD contribute to neuronal damage and impaired
neuron remyelination. Leveraging our expertise on using iPSC-derived neurons and cortical organoids as
cellular models for brain disorders, we will characterize the cell type vulnerability to LD/cholesterol and the
corresponding epigenomic/transcriptomic changes in the context of AD risk alleles. In Aim 1, to determine the
neural vulnerability to LD and its clinical relevance in AD, we will co-culture Ex and Inhibitory (Inh) neurons of a
cohort of 60 patient-specific iPSC lines, and assay neural LD, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and neural
morphometrics, which will then be associated with APOE alleles and non-APOE AD polygenic risk scores.
These cellular phenotypes will also be correlated with patients’ longitudinal plasma lipid levels and other
clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, to understand molecular mechanisms underlying neural vulnerability to LD, we will
perform single-cell RNA/ATAC-sequencing on the same neural co-cultures used in Aim 1 to identify genes with
chromatin accessibility and transcription correlated with cellular LD in each cell type. In Aim 3, to examine the
effect of AD risk alleles on cholesterol-mediated neuron-OPC communication and myelination, we will first use
CRISPR editing to generate isogenic iPSC lines carrying AD risk alleles and then differentiate them into
myelinating cerebral organoids. We will examine the effects of AD risk alleles on neuronal cholesterol levels as
well as the OPC proliferation and neuron myelination. This study will significantly advance our understanding of
the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal vulnerability to abnormal LD and cholesterol in AD."

This is a study of mortality risk in the deadliest pandemic in the 20th Century, the Spanish flu of 1918, in two of
the U.S. cities with the highest number of fatalities, New York and Philadelphia. It has four main aims. Aim 1 is
to examine mortality from the Spanish flu at the neighborhood scale in these cities. Aim 2 is to extend the
ecological analysis with multilevel models including individual-level predictors. Aim 3 is to compare the
patterns of influenza/pneumonia mortality during the pandemic with mortality in the same period in the previous
year, and Aim 4 is to compare patterns between cities. Few studies of pandemics have gone beyond analyzing
mortality data at the level of whole cities to consider spatial variation within cities, and there have been none
that examined risk of mortality in a pandemic using multilevel models. In this project, drawing on individual
death records, attention can be directed to specific neighborhoods and mortality risk of their residents. The
study will show how personal characteristics such as age, gender, race, nativity, and social class affect risk of
mortality in a multilevel model that includes similar characteristics measured at a neighborhood scale and also
incorporates spatial relationships among neighborhoods.
These aims will be addressed through analysis of a new data set with several innovative components. 1)
Transcription of all death certificates during fall 1917 and fall 1918 in New York and Philadelphia including the
person’s name, age, race, gender, address, cause of death, date of death, occupation, and parents’ names
and place of birth. 2) Geocoding of addresses in a historically accurate GIS system, so that persons can be
linked to their neighborhoods. 3) Use of 100% census microdata from 1920 to create measures of
neighborhood characteristics, construct a comparison sample of flu survivors, and glean information about the
households of those who died. These data will allow the project to probe the independent effects of various
individual risk factors while also examining neighborhood differences and spatial patterns in mortality."

This project examines mental health from before to after an elective termination of pregnancy and whether and
how the sociocultural context is associated with mental health around an elective termination. This research is
important for effectively and efficiently promoting mental health in women and their families and for the well-
being of future generations. Only one U.S. study conducted 30 years ago has examined depressive symptoms
from before to after an elective termination, and no research has directly examined whether or how the
sociocultural context influences mental health around an elective termination. Much has changed in the past 30
years regarding the sociocultural context and who has elective terminations. Patients who have elective
terminations are more racially and ethnically diverse, more likely to be low income, and more likely to be
mothers already. With respect to the sociocultural context, there has been an overall increase in the volume of
enacted policies around elective terminations (with 2021 having the most since 1973), a decrease in the
number of clinics providing elective terminations, and an increase in the percentage of U.S. adults believing
elective terminations should be legal in all or most cases. Furthermore, within the U.S. these sociocultural
indicators vary by geographical location. The long-term goal of this research is to understand whether and how
the sociocultural context influences mental health around an elective termination so that brief interventions to
promote mental health among those having elective terminations may be implemented most effectively and
efficiently. The primary objectives of this proposal are to test the feasibility of a novel methodology that
assesses mental health (including depressive, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and
suicidal ideation) from before to after an elective termination and examines whether and how the sociocultural
context influences mental health around an elective termination. To do this, we propose to recruit and follow for
a year 560 women having elective terminations in two very different sociocultural contexts (280 in each
context). Informed by stress and coping theory, empirical research, and our recently conducted pilot cohort
study, we have the following aims: 1) To detail mental health changes from 1 week before to 1 year after an
elective termination, 2) To examine the extent to which the sociocultural context influences mental health
around an elective termination, 3) To investigate whether stigma, logistical experiences, cognitive appraisals
and coping expectations mediate the association between sociocultural context and mental health around an
elective termination, and 4) To explore whether social support buffers the effects of a negative sociocultural
context on mental health around an elective termination. Knowledge gained from the proposed research will
guide next steps in research and inform brief interventions and clinical practice aimed at promoting mental
health around an elective termination."

 Schistosomiasis-induced pulmonary hypertension (Sch-PH) is globally the most common cause of
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and its classification as a “neglected tropical disease” underscores the
large unmet need in understanding the disease pathobiology and developing effective treatments. Although
accumulating data support the likely contribution of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and
HIF-1-regulated glycolysis to the pathogenesis of PH, their significance in Sch-PH is largely unknown. This
proposal examines the potential role of HIF-1-dependent glycolysis in promoting Sch-PH, specifically in lung
interstitial macrophages (IMs). Available data demonstrate increased pulmonary perivascular infiltration of IMs
in both humans and experimental mice with Sch-PH; increased transcription of HIF-1-associated genes encoding
glycolytic enzymes in murine lung IMs with Sch-PH; and a protective effect of HIF-1α deletion in LsyM+ myeloid
cells against murine Sch-PH. Building upon these key insights, this proposal will test the hypothesis that HIF-1-
dependent glycolysis in perivascular lung IMs critically contributes to the development of Sch-PH. Of the three
potential growth-promoting mechanisms of glycolysis--lactate fermentation, the pentose phosphate pathway,
and the mitochondrial Krebs cycle--the potential mechanistic link between lactate and pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation will be additionally examined. Two aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine
necessity and sufficiency of lung IM HIF-1α stabilization in Sch-PH by conditionally deleting and stabilizing HIF-
1α in IMs of transgenic mice. The effect of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A; an enzyme responsible for lactate
fermentation) deletion and oxamate (LDH-A inhibitor) treatment on Sch-PH severity will be examined. Aim 2 will
spatiotemporally phenotype lung IMs, quantify their glucose metabolism, and test, using co-culture, if lung IM-
derived lactate induces a pro-proliferative, pro-fibrogenic phenotype in PASMCs. Completion of the project will
clarify how glucose metabolism in lung IMs contributes to Sch-PH pathobiology.

Our overarching goal is to discover the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying behavioral predisposition
and development of addiction. Addiction remains a substantial worldwide social and economic burden despite
extensive efforts to curb drug availability and use. The high heritability of cocaine addiction, indicates that the
propensity to develop a substance use disorder (SUD) after drug exposure is genetically influenced. Both
human and animal studies indicate that behavioral traits such as novelty seeking are strongly correlated with
the propensity to develop an SUD, but the biological basis of this relationship is unknown. We identify and
characterize biological mechanisms of addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing advances in mouse
genetic resources, including the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population, validation in
genetically modified mice, gene expression quantitation through RNA sequence analysis, and computational
and statistical methods in systems genetics. In Aim 1 we will identify genetic mechanisms underlying
predisposing novelty-related traits and drug self-administration through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in
a large set of DO mice. The most compelling and tractable of these will be validated in gene targeted mouse
models. The intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA) paradigm, considered the gold standard for the
assessment of addiction traits in rodent research, will enable quantification of the core features of addiction
including initiation of drug use, poor extinction and enhanced reinstatement of reinforced drug taking. In Aim 2
we will quantify gene expression genetic variation in two connected addiction relevant tissues, the prefrontal
cortex and striatum, map expression QTLs and identify genetic correlates of predisposing behavior using RNA-
seq in a drug-naïve subset of DO mice, and disseminate these results through widely used informatics
resources. Gene expression analysis in drug-naïve mice enables separation of the biological substrates of
predisposition to addiction from the biological sequelae of drug exposure. In Aim 3, we will address the
fundamental problem of evaluating coordinated gene expression across multiple components of the addiction
circuitry to assess relative dysregulation toward the identification of global- vs brain region-specific factors in
addiction vulnerability. This will be accomplished through the development of robust multivariate statistical
methods for identification of relations across multiple high dimensional data sets. This strategy will make
continued use of a common collection of phenotypes to relate disparate and incompatible measures across
two independent sets of mice, while extending into multiple tissue co-expression networks. Development of this
technique in the context of addiction research will extend a unifying data integration framework to
multidimensional to human and mouse genetic and genomic studies for all disease areas. Synergy among the
aims will reveal networks from polymorphism to addiction-related behavior."

Disparities in outcomes among cancer patients who are rural-residing, with lower SES, and a racial minority
are well-documented and have garnered significant national media attention. Recent retrospective cohort
studies reported minimal rural/urban and racial disparities in outcomes when patients had uniform access to
care, highlighting the critical clinical importance of standardizing access to cancer care. Data made available
which evaluates access to specialists typically determines access based on a per capita count of individual
specialties, which does not adequately capture access to interdisciplinary teams of specialists. A relatively
unexplored area of study is the extent to which relationships between cancer specialists can be characterized
and then targeted to standardize access to cancer care, reduce cancer health disparities, and improve patient
outcomes. By assessing the relationships between physicians based on patient-sharing and geographic
proximity patterns observed in administrative data, we propose to apply our team’s expertise in network
analysis and cancer care to provide a framework for evaluating patient access to cancer care which recognizes
the coordination across medical oncology, radiation, and surgical specialists. We aim to develop and apply a
novel network measure– linchpin centrality – which identifies cancer specialists who are the only specialist of
their kind among their neighbors’ ties. We propose to evaluate variation of physician linchpin centrality by
cancer patient race and geographic variables, building on previous work demonstrating that racial disparities
vary significantly across US cities and rural subregions. We will further evaluate associations between
physician linchpin centrality and timely treatment and cancer mortality. One avenue for increasing access to
specialist care is through cancer specialists traveling to a secondary practice location, typically a rural hospital
in a community too small to support a full-time specialist. However, little is known about the impact of traveling
physicians on existing relationships between physicians and patient access to coordinated cancer care, a gap
in knowledge our proposal will address. In analyses specific to rural areas, we will assess the extent to which
physician travelers impact physician network structure and patient outcomes. Finally, we will conduct a
qualitative study to inform further development of linchpin centrality and a network algorithm as an intervention
to improve cancer care. The algorithm we develop will provide health systems with actionable data on the
organization of cancer care providers for their catchment and can help guide interventions and allocate
resources appropriately. In conclusion, this proposal uses network analysis to capture essential characteristics
of the quality of care for cancer patients, with the goal of bridging theory and practice to improve access and
outcomes with a network-guided intervention."

The vast majority of child tuberculosis (TB) deaths occur in children <5 years old, highlighting the importance of
identifying young children at high risk of developing TB and initiating preventive treatment. However, current
tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection have poor predictive value for TB progression. To make
progress toward biomarker-targeted TB preventive therapy in young children, there is an urgent need to identify
novel host markers that reflect the unique pathogenesis of childhood TB, can be detected earlier in the course
of disease progression and can be more easily translated to a point-of-care assay. The overall objective of the
proposed project is to identify biomarker signatures among young children that meet the World Health
Organization (WHO)-recommended minimum accuracy targets for a test of TB progression. We hypothesize that
a subset of host biomarkers of childhood TB disease that reflect unsuccessful immune control of Mtb infection
will have the best performance for early prediction of TB disease progression in young children. To examine our
hypothesis, we propose to leverage 1) biorepositories that provide access to banked samples from children with
presumptive TB and healthy children with and without TB exposure and Mtb infection (Uganda, South Africa, the
Gambia); 2) biorepositories that provide serial samples from young children followed for 12 months or more for
incident TB disease (Uganda, South Africa, Vietnam); and 3) state-of-the-art platforms and bioinformatic
pipelines for multi-omics biomarker discovery. In Aim 1, we will measure and compare biomarker levels (host
cell-free RNA, proteins, metabolites and antibodies to Mtb antigens) in symptomatic children with presumptive
TB and healthy children to identify candidate host biomarkers that differentiate childhood TB disease,
differentiate Mtb infection, overlap between TB disease and Mtb infection, and segregate Mtb infection into
multiple sub-groups. In Aim 2, we will use pathway analysis, in vitro human models and in vivo mouse models
to prioritize candidate host biomarkers that are functionally linked to immune control of Mtb infection. In Aim 3,
we will derive biosignatures consisting of the prioritized candidate host biomarker(s) and evaluate their accuracy
for predicting TB progression overall and among children living with HIV in independent training and test sets.
Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in
large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care tests for predicting progression of childhood TB."

Background: Latino adults have a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related
complications. Diabetes medication non-adherence is an important modifiable contributor to suboptimal
glycemic management among Latino adults, who are nearly twice as likely to report non-adherence to diabetes
medications as non-Hispanic White individuals. Besides language barriers, additional commonly reported
barriers that contribute to non-adherence in this population include negative perceptions about insulin use and
misunderstanding ongoing need for diabetes medications once HbA1c has improved. Mobile health (mHealth)
technology can reduce medication adherence barriers and improve adherence behavior, but mHealth tools that
address commonly reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence among Latino adults are lacking.
Candidate: I am an endocrinologist born and raised in Latin America; my long-term career goal is to develop
scalable, patient-centered interventions that address gaps in diabetes self-care to improve outcomes among
Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. Training: I have received outstanding research training in epidemiology but
to achieve my long-term career goal I require additional training in: 1) adaptation of evidence-based
interventions, 2) mixed methods, and 3) conduct of clinical trials in mHealth. Mentors: My training and
research plans will be overseen by Primary Mentor Dr. Deborah Wexler (type 2 diabetes clinical
trials/intervention adaptation) and Co-Mentor Dr. Lindsay Mayberry (mixed methodologist/mHealth clinical
trials). Drs. Margarita Alegria (behavioral intervention adaptation to a Latino population), Enrique Caballero
(cultural tailoring of diabetes interventions to a Latino population), J. Jaime Miranda (mHealth intervention
development/testing in Latino populations), and Tanayott Thaweethai (biostatistics) will provide additional
focused expertise. Research: I will adapt REACH, a text message-based mHealth platform with content
tailored to address self-reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence (developed by Dr. Mayberry), to a
Latino population (REACH-Español) with type 2 diabetes through two specific aims. Aim 1: Adapt and develop
REACH-Es content on barriers to diabetes medication adherence with engagement of a diverse group of
stakeholders (n=8), qualitative input from Latino adults with type 2 diabetes (n=20-30), and beta testing for
intervention refinement with stakeholder input. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot RCT (n=70) to assess feasibility,
acceptability, and usability of REACH-Es, as well as intervention targets (diabetes medication adherence and
barriers to adherence) comparing REACH-Es to control; secondary outcomes are HbA1c and diabetes self-
efficacy. The project will generate preliminary data for an R01 hybrid-effectiveness implementation trial of
REACH-Es. The completion of these training and scientific aims will facilitate my transition to becoming an
independent physician-investigator focused on developing scalable, patient-centered interventions that
address gaps in diabetes self-care to improve outcomes among Latino adults with type 2 diabetes."

Pneumonia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, which has come into sharp focus recently
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lung is immunologically unique, and neutrophils traversing the lungs must
be ready to respond to potential pathogen challenges without causing injury to surrounding tissues. Disruptions
of this balance lead to many severe complications of pneumonia, but we lack therapeutics directed toward
neutrophil-mediated immune dysfunction. Our preliminary data demonstrate that neutrophils undergo
transcriptional remodeling as they travel from the circulation to the alveolar space during pneumonia. A subset
of pro-inflammatory genes is upregulated as neutrophils move from the vasculature to the interstitium, while
genes related to metabolism and degranulation are upregulated as cells move from interstitium to the alveolar
space. Maintenance of appropriate neutrophil function and development requires tight regulation of gene
changes, yet the specific pathways underlying such changes constitute a major knowledge gap. The goal of
this proposal is to delineate the transcriptional and functional changes neutrophils undergo as they migrate
from the circulation to the site of infection during pneumonia. Our central hypothesis is that during
pneumonia, appropriate neutrophil function is achieved by proscribed responses to specific
environmental stimuli, resulting in a heterogenous population defined by their interaction history.
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that location-specific neutrophil responses in pneumonia are achieved by the tuning
of neutrophil transcriptome and function by environmental stimuli. Using complementary in vitro and in vivo
models we will determine the contributions of migration, pathogen interaction and cytokine signaling to
neutrophil gene programs and function. Outcomes will include transcriptional and functional changes predicted
by our preliminary studies. These findings will then be confirmed in an in vivo model of pneumonia, employing
exogenously added labeled neutrophils. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that during transit to the alveolar space,
neutrophils differentiate into subpopulations unique to the lung, with transcriptional and functional
heterogeneity. Using a combination of in vivo cell labeling, flow cytometry assisted cell sorting, and single cell
RNA sequencing, we will track modulations in the neutrophil transcriptome from circulation to alveolar space at
a single cell level. Aim 3: NFκB-RelA is a central transcription factor in neutrophils, driving the upregulation of a
pro-inflammatory transcriptional program during migration to the alveolar space. Using complementary in vitro
and in vivo loss-of function models we will determine the effect of neutrophil NFκB-RelA on pneumonia
outcomes neutrophil transcriptome and neutrophil function. The results of these studies will have a positive
impact the field of pneumonia biology furthering our knowledge of neutrophil function and laying the
groundwork for future development of novel host-directed neutrophil-based pneumonia therapeutics."

The goal of this proposal is to develop molecular tools and approaches for the study of the
pathogenic free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. These currently do not exist. This amoeba
is the causative agent of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an almost invariable
lethal brain infection. The lack of useful drugs for the treatment of this infection emphasizes
the need to develop better therapeutic agents for amoebae infections. The lack of
understanding of gene function in the parasite remains a major hurdle in target-based drug
development campaigns. Here, we propose to address this problem by developing
approaches for gene silencing and ablation by RNAi and CRISP/Cas9-mediate gene editing
and transgene expression. These approaches will serve as an important first step in
understanding both gene function and essentiality, key to early-stage drug discovery efforts."

Bipolar spectrum disorders [BSD] are impairing and costly psychiatric conditions that typically emerge in late
adolescence and early adulthood. Subthreshold mania symptoms, increasing in severity over the span of
months-to-years, remain the most important symptomatic precursor of future BSD onset. However, only a subset
of young people with subthreshold mania symptoms transition to a BSD and, regardless of later clinical diagnosis,
these symptoms severely impact real-world functioning and clinical outcome. While early treatment of
subthreshold mania symptoms appears increasingly imperative for a favorable prognosis, these symptoms are
difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions. Too often, delayed symptom recognition results in
detrimental treatments and poor prognosis. Even if mania symptoms are correctly identified, it is unclear which
individuals will progress to a more severe course and thus require more intensive early treatment. As a result,
there remains a pressing clinical need to identify objective biobehavioral risk markers that will improve prevention
and intervention for the full mania spectrum. Psychomotor activation - increased activity or energy - is a cardinal
feature of the mania spectrum that can be quantified through objective measurement of locomotor activity. In a
comprehensive laboratory assessment and naturalistic follow-up study, we propose to uncover the biobehavioral
(circadian, reward) mechanisms driving locomotor activation and mania spectrum risk. We will recruit N=170
adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 24 years-old across a range of lifetime subthreshold mania symptoms
but with no prior history of a BSD. Participants will complete 2 weeks of field-based locomotor activity monitoring
with wrist actigraphy, followed by a comprehensive lab-based assessment of exploratory locomotor behavior,
circadian function, and reward sensitivity. Over follow-up, actigraphic locomotor activity and clinical status will be
indexed prospectively every 6-months for up to 3-years. Our primary aims will test the overarching hypothesis
that locomotor activation is a behavioral marker of mania symptom severity and progression [Aim 1], and that
neurobiological dysregulation of the circadian and reward systems drive locomotor activation [Aim 2] and mania
symptom progression over time [Aim 3]. We will use high-dimensional modeling approaches to identify
multivariate locomotor, circadian, reward profiles predictive of mania symptoms and their progression over time,
which will inform more comprehensive biobehavioral predictive models for the mania spectrum. Exploratory
analyses will 1) incorporate more nuanced locomotor metrics from a novel reverse-translational open field task
and 2) examine the specificity of our model to mania vs other clinical outcomes. Our results have the potential
to 1) improve early detection of mania symptoms through real-time, objective locomotor activity monitoring and
2) provide mania-relevant circadian and reward targets for behavioral, chronotherapeutic, or neuromodulatory
interventions that alleviate or prevent mania symptoms more effectively than current best-practice approaches."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and devastating muscle disease, resulting from the
absence of dystrophin. This leads to cell membrane instability, susceptibility to contraction-induced muscle
damage, muscle cell death, and disability and early death of patients. Currently, there is no cure for DMD.
Lipin1 is a phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes diacylglycerol (DAG)
biosynthesis. It is also the predominant lipin isoform in skeletal muscles. In addition to its enzymatic activity,
lipin1 can regulate transcription. A recent publication from this lab identified a previously unknown role of lipin1
in promoting myocyte enhancer factor 2c (MEF2c) transcriptional activity via DAG signaling in skeletal muscle.
Notably, our findings showed that loss of lipin1 leads to myopathy. Preliminary data also showed that lipin1
expression was dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscles of DMD patients and mdx (DMDmdx) mice, a
mouse model for DMD. Strikingly, further data show that increasing lipin1 levels in mdx mice lessened muscle
fiber degeneration, strengthened membrane integrity, and led to impressive gains in strength. Based on these
novel findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that lipin1 overexpression ameliorates the dystrophic
phenotype in DMD through its PAP activity and its ability to regulate transcription. This hypothesis will be
tested via the following Specific Aims: 1) Assess the pathological and functional benefit of lipin1
overexpression in mdx:lipin1 transgenic mice in early and late stages of the disease; 2) Determine the
therapeutic efficacy of AAV9-mediated systemic lipin1 gene delivery; and 3) Test the hypothesis that lipin1
regulates muscle membrane integrity through the transcriptional regulation of structural genes and through
PAP activity.
NIH Mission Relevance: DMD affects 15.9-19.5 individuals per 100,000 live births. Specifically, DMD patients
often manifest disability around age 3-5, and many require a wheelchair before age 12. Progressive muscle
weakness often results in early mortality around age 30. This research seeks to elucidate the role of lipin1 as a
novel regulator to prevent dystrophic pathologies, and will determine whether lipin1 can serve as a target to re-
establish membrane stability and restore muscle function. Such information is expected to have a
transformative impact on the treatment of DMD, as well as open new avenues for the treatment of several
clinically related conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis, age-related muscle loss, and other muscular dystrophies
which share common features associated with decreased lipin1 expression."

Social disconnection and loneliness surge in adolescence and have a negative impact on youth physical and
mental health. Furthermore, social disconnection during this life stage predicts difficulties forming and
maintaining relationships in adulthood, with similarly negative consequences for adult physical and mental
health. A key underlying process for adolescents’ risk of social disconnection may be their heightened biological
stress reactivity. A major theory by Taylor postulated that the stress response can activate two primary social-
behavioral profiles, “fight-or-flight” (i.e., an increase in conflict or social withdrawal), or “tend-and-befriend” (i.e.,
an increase in prosocial and affiliative behavior). However, most prior research on Taylor’s model has been with
adults, creating a gap in our understanding of when and why these profiles emerge in development, and how
biology, personality, and social relationships contribute to youths’ tendencies to respond to social challenges
with socially distancing versus socially engaging behaviors. The current project aims to fill these critical gaps by
revealing the biological, personality, and relationship characteristics that differentiate these two social-behavioral
stress profiles. To meet this objective, the research team will undertake two specific aims. First, the team will
recruit a new sample of 280 adolescents ages 11-16 years old to complete a social evaluation stressor and
biobehavioral assessments in the laboratory, followed by psychosocial assessments one year later. The team
will test the role of social relationships, personality, and biological characteristics (oxytocin, adrenocortical,
autonomic, and inflammatory activity) in differentiating “fight-or-flight” versus “tend-and-befriend” profiles in
response to the social evaluation stressor, and predict longitudinal change in loneliness using these profiles. For
the second aim, the team will conduct new analyses of existing data from a longitudinal study of 674
predominantly low-income Mexican-origin Hispanic youth in California, who have been followed from age 10 to
age 24. New assays of stored, frozen samples for oxytocin will also be conducted in a subsample of 229 youth
from this study who at age 17 completed a social exclusion protocol with biological assessments (adrenocortical,
autonomic, and inflammatory activity). The second aim is to identify the prospective contributions of social
relationships and personality to adolescents’ “fight-or-flight” versus “tend-and-befriend” profiles in response to a
social exclusion stressor, and use these two profiles to predict change in time spent alone longitudinally. With
the full sample of 674 Mexican-origin youth, we will test that relationship quality and youth personality will predict
increased versus decreased time spent alone during waves when school transitions occur. By accomplishing
these aims, this project will deliver a multi-faceted understanding of how social disconnection develops and
identify key biobehavioral targets that can be modified to improve social connectedness in adolescence and
beyond."

Our understanding of cancer progression or response to therapies would benefit from easily accessible, patient-
specific assays that recapitulate the biology and anatomy of human tumors. To this end, we will develop
methodology for integrating tumor explants with engineered stroma and vasculature in vitro. With appropriate
culture conditions, a self-assembled vascular network develops and then incorporates into co-cultured tumors
excised from mice or patients. The system provides a representative extracellular matrix, associated stromal cells,
and a lumenized vessel network. The methodology is straightforward and amenable to high throughput assays,
making it an attractive tool for in vitro drug screening or for the guidance of patient-specific chemotherapies. Using
this approach, we propose to create a platform for optimally maintaining samples from patients with pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ex vivo in vascularized tumor explants (VTEs) for the purpose of biological analysis
and drug testing. We will characterize the VTEs and validate the system using mouse xenograft models and surgical
tissue samples from PDAC patients treated at the MGH Cancer Center. When complete, this project will establish
a robust, high throughput, and validated platform for analyzing tumor biology or drug testing, thus accelerating
cancer research and enabling personalize therapy for cancer."

Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death and
morbidity world-wide. Metabolic shifts and oxidative stress that occur in the myocardium during the phases of
ischemia as well as reperfusion cause myocardial injury and play a pivotal role in the development and
progression of myocardial damage and heart failure (HF). Humanin (HN), a novel small peptide generated by
mitochondria, has been shown to exhibit strong cytoprotection in many age-related diseases with increased
oxidative stress including Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial and cerebral ischemia, and type 2
diabetes. Our group has demonstrated that administration of HN results in a decrease in infarct size and
preservation of cardiac function in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI-R) injury.
Additionally, our preliminary data presented in this grant submission shows that HN administration results in: 1)
infarct size reduction following MI-R injury in aging rodent and clinically-relevant porcine models of MI-R; 2)
improved cardiac function as evidenced by decreased end diastolic volume in old mice with myocardial
ischemia-induced heart failure; 3) increased peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, and inhibition of mitochondrial
fatty acid oxidation in primary cardiomyocytes and heart lysates; 4) decreases ROS and 5) improved survival
of cardiomyocytes following hypoxia and oxidative stress. Based on these data, we hypothesize that HN
treatment will improve cardiac function in MI-R injury or MI induced heart failure (HF) through its unique ability
to induce metabolic adaptations in cardiac myocytes, improve peroxisomal function and decrease ROS,
thereby limiting acute myocardial cell death, and preventing the progression to HF. In this grant application, we
will delineate the cardioprotective efficacy of HN in murine models of MI-R injury and MI induced HF in aging
and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie HN’s cardioprotective effects on the myocardium. In an exploratory
sub aim, we will assess HN levels in heart and circulation in human subjects with post-ischemia cardiac failure.
Results from these experiments may potentially have a tremendous impact in treating cardiovascular diseases.
HN may provide a much-needed therapeutic option for patients to protect the myocardium from ischemic and
reperfusion injuries, and prevent the progression to HF."

This Core will integrate transgenic, knockout, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene perturbation technologies into the study
of TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 functions and interactions. Core B has the expertise with both conventional
and conditional transgenic and knockout technology, as well as CRISPR/Cas9 engineering, which will enable
the generation of novel mouse strains for analyzing the functions of TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 functions and
interactions in vivo. The Mouse Engineering Core provides a critical means by which the PPG will achieve its
goals of understanding how TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 mediate their immunoregulatory functions.
Core B will provide PPG investigators with an important and unique collection of mouse strains for their studies.
To facilitate studies of the function of TIGIT and PD-1 in specific cell types, the Core will cross TIGIT (TIGITfl/fl)
and PD-1 (PD-1fl/fl) floxed mice with different Cre driver strains. Likewise, to enable analyses of the function of
CD155 and PD-L1 in specific cell types, the Core will cross CD155 (CD155fl/fl) and PD-L1 (PD-L1fl/fl) floxed mice
with different Cre driver strains. The initial priority will be to breed CD155fl/fl mice with PD-L1fl/fl and CD11cCre
and Zbtb46Cre mice to delete CD155 and PD-L1 in dendritic cells (DC). These strains will enable studies of the
role of CD155 and PD-L1, individually and together on DC. Core B also will generate CD155 mutant mouse
strains to support studies of CD155 cell intrinsic functions. The generation of CD155 ITIM mutant and CD155
cytoplasmic tail-less mouse strains to enable studies of bidirectional interaction of TIGIT with CD155 will be the
initial priority. Importantly, these CD155 mutations will preserve CD155 receptor binding and adhesion functions,
but alter intracellular signaling, thus enabling study of how these mutations impact CD155 cell intrinsic functions.
In addition, Core B will enable PPG investigators to identify mediators of TIGIT/CD155 and CD155/PD-L1
functions, individually and in combination, in effector and regulatory T cells. Core B will generate lentiviruses
with gRNAs for use in vivo in the CHIME (CHimeric IMmune Editing) CRISPR/Cas9 gene perturbation platform.
CHIME enables perturbation of genes in naïve lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells in vivo without
altering their development. Core B will use CHIME to enable studies to validate prioritized genes identified by
proteomic and transcriptional data in Project 1 (Kuchroo), Project 2 and Project 3 (Hafler). Core C will integrate
the data sets from the projects and assist with gene prioritization.
Finally, Core B will serve as a repository for new mouse strains generated during the course of this PPG. The
Mouse Engineering Core will provide breeding pairs of these strains to PPG investigators as needed and
cryopreserve strains."
10836504,"Overall Summary
Transplantation tolerance, a state of hyporesponsiveness to donor antigens after cessation of therapy, is an
attractive approach for achieving life-long graft acceptance without global immunosuppression. Tolerance is rare
in the clinic, and even when attained can be lost over time, sometimes after infections. Understanding the barriers
to the induction of transplant tolerance in the clinic, and the vulnerabilities to durable tolerance, is essential to
achieving the goal of one transplant for life. One barrier to the induction of transplant tolerance in the clinic is T
cell memory (Tmem). The intrinsic independence of Tmem from costimulation and their resistance to Tregs can
explain the difficulty in inducing tolerance. Project 2 has identified an additional hurdle by which Tmem can
antagonize the induction of transplant tolerance: a small number of Tmem can “infect” naïve T cells into acquiring
memory-like features and resisting costimulation blockade (CoB) via a process of ‘linked-sensitization’.
Once established, transplantation tolerance may exhibit vulnerabilities to its maintenance especially during
settings of proinflammatory infection. Project 1 has identified heterogeneity in states of dysfunction achieved by
polyclonal alloreactive T cells following CoB, with T cells specific for alloantigens that are rapidly downregulated
in the graft following transplantation, and T cells with low affinity/avidity to graft antigens, retaining function
despite CoB. These functional T cells do not pose a threat to the graft at steady state because they are controlled
by Tregs. However, inflammatory cytokines elicited by some infections are known to destabilize Tregs, activate
APCs and upregulate graft MHC, such that these T cells that retain function may mediate graft rejection.
Both projects have identified a solution to these barriers/vulnerabilities. Project 2 found that exposing donor-
reactive Tmem to a semi-allogeneic pregnancy re-programs Tmem into becoming susceptible to CoB. Project
1 shows that repeated injections of donor splenocytes can induce dysfunction in a wider repertoire of alloreactive
T cells, including Tmem. The molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of dysfunction will be investigated
and compared between projects, thus underscoring the synergy of the projects. The global hypothesis of the
current submission is that understanding the mechanisms by which linked sensitization and heterogeneity in
alloreactive T cell dysfunction prevent tolerance induction or break established tolerance, as well as the
mechanisms by which exposure to pregnancy or to repeated donor splenocyte injections overcome these
barriers, will help identify critical molecular drivers of tolerance, markers of robust versus unstable tolerance, and
aid in the design of new therapeutic approaches to induce durable transplantation tolerance. Project 1 addresses
the mechanisms by which the duration of alloantigen expression determines the level of T cell dysfunction post-
CoB (Aim 1) and tests the hypothesis that low affinity/avidity alloreactive T cells are poised to mediate rejection
during infections (Aim 2). Project 2 investigates the mechanism behind linked sensitization (Aim 1), and how
CD8+ (Aim 2) and CD4+ (Aim 3) alloreactive Tmem are re-programmed by pregnancy."
10873872,"Cancer cells are embedded in a protective and nourishing “niche”, an
environment that cancer cells create by secreting proteins into their surroundings. Because cancer cells
depend on their niche to survive and spread to other parts of the body, we believe that therapies designed to
inhibit secretion could suppress cancer spread and thereby improve the length and quality of cancer patients'
lives. Developing such therapies will require a better understanding of how secretion is activated in cancer. Our
proposal will address this knowledge gap. Here we show that p53 protein loss, an established driver of cancer
spread, enhances secretion by reprogramming the Golgi apparatus, a master regulator of protein transport in
cells. We show that p53 loss activates the formation of a Golgi protein complex that controls secretion, and we
have identified secreted proteins that are essential for lung cancer growth and spread. Furthermore, we have
identified a drug that can block the formation of the Golgi protein complex, reduce secretion, and inhibit lung
cancer growth and spread. In this application, we seek to elucidate the molecular underpinnings and
therapeutic implications of the heightened secretion driven by p53 loss. In aim 1, we propose studies to
elucidate how the Golgi protein complex enhances secretion and drives lung cancer progression. In aim 2, we
propose studies to determine how the Golgi protein complex increases sensitivity to the drug we have
identified. These studies will provide insight into how secretion is activated in cancer and may lead to new
ways to target secretion in cancer patients."

With recent enactment of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, there is a
growing impetus to identify pediatric indications for molecularly targeted drugs. Accordingly, there is a pressing
need for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application
of nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a
preclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across
a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing
Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors,
desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research
Team are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents
for preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections
to disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical
evaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2.
Utilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will
utilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium
where necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic
question. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data
analyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in
validating (“go”) or invalidating (“no go”) therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses
with advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the
combined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced
response or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend
on transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers
have to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research
Team will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to
enable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical
trials for children with high risk solid tumors."
10890672,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The long-term goal of our research is to improve our understanding of the pathologic
mechanisms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and to leverage that knowledge to advance therapeutics.
Progress in treating respiratory insufficiency and other complications of muscle deterioration has led to cardiac
disease emerging as a principal cause of morbidity and mortality in DMD. Consequently, there is a critical need
to identify the specific pathogenic mechanisms that promote DMD-related cardiac disease so that targeted
therapeutics can be developed. The complex pathology initiates with mechanically compromised myocytes but
is intertwined with secondary defects that contribute importantly to disease progression. Fibrosis is one of the
earliest clinical manifestations of cardiac involvement in DMD occurring prior to ventricular dysfunction indicating
the presence of activated fibroblasts early in the progression of pathology. Fibroblasts produce extracellular
matrix that comprises fibrotic scar, but it is not known whether they possess other maladaptive functions that
affect disease progression. Our preliminary findings now show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is greatly
increased in cardiac fibroblasts of mdx mice, a genetic mouse model of DMD. Elevated FGF23 is remarkably
associated with important clinical events related to cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with renal
disease and in the general population. FGF23 is a hormone that mostly works in cooperation with its co-receptor
Klotho, but can also stimulate pathological signaling in atypical cellular targets. FGF23 exerts pathologic effects
on cardiac myocytes by binding to FGF receptor (FGFR) 4 independent of Klotho, which is not expressed in the
heart. Our central hypothesis is that dystrophic cardiac fibroblasts exert paracrine effects on cardiac myocytes
via FGF23, thereby activating FGFR4 to promote cardiac disease in DMD. Our preliminary findings showing that
Klotho is cardioprotective in mdx mice strongly supports our hypothesis that FGF23 signaling contributes
importantly to cardiac remodeling. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two comprehensive specific
aims. In Aim 1 we will test whether FGF23 is a paracrine factor produced by cardiac fibroblasts that promotes
dystrophin-deficient cardiac pathology and functional defects using a conditional genetic approach combined
with ex vivo cell culture experiments. In Aim 2 we will determine whether FGFR4 activation in cardiac myocytes
affects dystrophin-deficient cardiac remodeling and function using complementary loss-of-function and gain-of-
function genetic approaches. The proposed research is innovative because it is predicted to show that fibroblasts
exert regulatory effects on cardiac myocytes and establish FGF23/FGFR4 signaling as a novel pathogenic
mechanism of DMD. This contribution is significant because it is expected to provide strong mechanistic
justification for modulating FGF23/FGFR4 as a therapeutic target to treat DMD."
10890070,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kawasaki disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in the US, is an acute
febrile illness and systemic vasculitis believed to be of infectious etiology that causes coronary artery aneurysms
and can result in long-term cardiovascular sequelae. Coronary artery aneurysms develop in 25% of untreated
KD children, leading to ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. While intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) treatment lowers this rate to 5%, up to 20% of KD patients are IVIG-resistant and have a greater risk for
coronary inflammation. A better understanding of the immune and pathological mechanisms leading to the
development of KD vasculitis is needed to identify more efficacious KD therapeutics and prevent the long-term
cardiovascular sequelae stemming from tissue inflammation and coronary remodeling. In preliminary studies
using a murine model of KD vasculitis, we discovered that genes related to inflammatory responses and IL-1
signaling are upregulated in the inflamed abdominal aorta. In addition, expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a histone
deacetylase known for its cardioprotective functions, was decreased in the inflamed abdominal aorta of mice
during KD vasculitis. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this R01 application is that SIRT1 plays a critical role
in preventing bacterial ligand-induced IL-1β-driven vasculitis by promoting autophagy/mitophagy, which
impairs NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production. To test this hypothesis, we will complete the
following specific aims: 1) Determine the expression pattern of SIRT1 and its role in bacterial ligand-
induced KD vasculitis and 2) Determine the mechanism by which SIRT1 activity modulates LCWE-
induced KD vasculitis. This proposal has a very high translational potential and will determine if compounds
known to activate and increase SIRT1 activity will improve or reduce cardiovascular pathology of KD. Importantly,
these studies will not only shed light on how SIRT1 influences the inflammatory response during the KD acute
phase but will also provide insight into the potential of SIRT1 modulation as a therapeutic intervention to prevent
long-term KD cardiovascular complications. Moreover, given the established role of IL-1 signaling in
atherosclerosis, our findings may illuminate novel therapeutic directions for a broad range of cardiovascular
diseases."
10887600,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections (intestinal worms) affect 1.5 billion individuals
globally. Recent evidence from trials and modeling studies suggests that community-wide mass
drug administration (cMDA) of deworming medication with sufficient coverage and adherence
can eliminate STH transmission. However, in settings with ongoing environmental transmission
and low coverage of networked sanitation, persistent environmental reservoirs of STH eggs
result in high reinfection rates, and hinder progress towards elimination.
 STH control programs use human stool-based methods to assess STH prevalence and
intensity in endemic settings. However, individual stool sampling is expensive and logistically
difficult, particularly when human infection prevalence is low. If collecting and analyzing soil from
locations in communities with high human activity (e.g. home entrances, water collection points,
schools) were established to be equally or more sensitive than human stool diagnostics, this
approach may represent a less invasive and more cost-effective surveillance tool for MDA
program monitoring and evaluation.
 This study will leverage a multi-country cluster-randomized controlled trial delivering
three-years of biannual cMDA in Benin and India (DeWorm3). The trial will collect and analyze
by qPCR, human stool samples 24 months (n=80,000 in total) after the final round of cMDA,
which will yield highly accurate human STH infection prevalence estimates in the study areas.
Through extensive laboratory studies and field testing in India and Benin, our team has
developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH environmental DNA
(eDNA) in large volumes of soil. We will nest soil sampling within the trial at the same time point
as human stool collection and one year later with the specific aims to: 1) Quantify the effect of a
biannual cMDA intervention on the soil STH reservoir; 2) Determine whether soil STH eDNA
levels can predict community-level human STH infection prevalence; and 3) Develop the optimal
soil sampling strategy and compare costs to human stool-based surveillance.
 Pairing soil STH eDNA assessments with human infection prevalence data already
being collected by the DeWorm3 trial is a unique and time sensitive opportunity to validate and
test the utility of environmental STH surveillance. Our findings will also contribute to
understanding the conditions under which MDA program integration with improved sanitation
interventions is needed for achieving sustained reductions in STH infection prevalence."
11140690,"TITLE: Investigating Interferon Antagonists in Delaying Innate Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2
PI: Susan C. Baker, PhD, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine
The goal of this proposal is to determine how viral interferon antagonists function in the replication and
pathogenesis of coronaviruses, particularly during replication of Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a diverse family of positive-sense RNA viruses that
include pathogenic strains infecting human and animal hosts. CoVs have repeatedly jumped from animal
reservoirs into human circulation, causing severe disease and pandemics, as we are currently experiencing
with SARS-CoV-2. Developing appropriate protective measures against emerging CoVs, including SARS-CoV-
2, will depend upon gaining an understanding of coronavirus-host interactions. We discovered that the
endoribonuclease (EndoU), a highly conserved component of the CoV replicase complex, reduces dsRNA
species recognized by host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, delaying the induction of interferon. We
reported that viruses expressing an inactive form of EndoU replicate as efficiently as wild type virus in IFN non-
responsive cells. Importantly, replication of EndoU mutant CoVs in interferon-responsive cells activate robust
immune responses, which extinguishes virus replication and reduces pathogenesis in animals. Recently, we
identified the target of EndoU activity to be poly-uridine containing negative sense RNA, which we term PUN
RNA. This removal of the PUN RNA delays the generation of dsRNA species that are recognized by host
pattern recognition receptor MDA5. We hypothesize that EndoU activity contributes to the delay in the
innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism of
how EndoU acts in SARS-CoV-2, how EndoU associates with the replicase complex, and how PUN RNA
contributes to activating MDA5. In Aim 1, we will evaluate EndoU and other IFN antagonists for their role as
modulators of Type I and Type III IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human airway cells and
in enterocytes. We will use reverse genetics to generate viruses with inactive IFN antagonists and evaluate the
effects of combining inactivation of EndoU with inactivating mutations of other viral protein IFN antagonists. In
Aim 2 we will delineate and disrupt EndoU interactions within the coronavirus replicase complex. The results of
these studies will guide strategies for disruption of EndoU from the CoV replicase complex, which would
activate protective immune responses to CoV infections. In Aim 3, we will identify regions of poly-uridine
negative-sense RNA, termed PUN RNA, required for recognition by EndoU and MDA5. These studies will
provide new information on how PUN RNAs are recognized by EndoU and MDA5. Overall, these studies will
define a new mechanism for how an endoribonuclease acts as a virulence factor. This new information can be
used to develop antiviral therapies and vaccines against existing and emerging coronaviruses."
10897211,"Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide
and is rising in incidence in the US. Over 80% of patients in the US with HCC have underlying cirrhosis, and
professional societies guidelines recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection.
Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected at an early stage when potentially curative treatments are
possible. Our proposal, based on our strong preliminary data evaluating glycoproteomic profiles, addresses the
clear unmet need for accurate early HCC detection biomarkers. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins,
which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early
HCC detection. Importantly, even subtle changes involving minor structures can be very specific in differentiating
cirrhosis versus early stage HCC. In this study, we will use a mass spectrometry approach, which has proven to
be a highly sensitive and accurate way to detect and quantitatively monitor glycan structural changes. Our
published mass analysis discovery work, tandem mass spectrometry measurements, and novel bioinformatic
tools for glycan and glycopeptide analysis demonstrate these minor changes in structure can act as promising
early HCC detection biomarkers. In aim 1 these methods will be demonstrated for glycopeptide screening from
serum using novel mass spec assays using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis based on a stepped
HCD fragmentation method which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The
PRM method is a targeted assay which can distinguish small changes in glycan structure and can be multiplexed
to monitor large numbers of markers simultaneously. In addition, using separations coupled to the PRM strategy,
we will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation in glycan structures
which may contain important disease related markers. In aim 2 the methods developed herein will be optimized
and then applied to a large confirmation set of 300 early stage HCC and cirrhosis samples for 20 target
glycopeptides from Haptoglobin and to several other potential glycopeptide markers discovered and evaluated
in our prior work. In aim 3 we will then validate the biomarker performance in a blinded phase II biomarker study
using a large set of 800-1000 early stage HCC and cirrhosis patients, diverse with regard to sex, race/ethnicity,
and liver disease etiology. Through these aims, we will identify a panel of glycopeptides that can serve as highly
accurate biomarkers for early HCC detection."
10880731,"Project Summary/Abstract: Biomarker Core
The theme of our UK-ADRC is Transitions from normal to late-life multi-etiology dementia, and the role of
the Biomarker Core is to provide data and support efforts to develop biomarker profiles for the spectrum of
underlying pathologies that can contribute to an individual’s cognitive decline. The Biomarker core will provide
critical characterization of our cohort during their cognitively normal state, and through their cognitive
transitions. The utility of biomarkers is expanding rapidly, as the dementia field identifies potentially disease-
modifying therapies. Rather than focusing on a single biomarker modality (i.e. MRI, PET, plasma etc.), we
have adopted a multimodal approach to biomarker characterization. Because our center is particularly
interested in multi-etiology dementia, the most common dementia in the normal aging population, we believe a
multimodal approach to biomarkers will yield novel insights into the progression of such complex dementias.
We propose to measure blood- and CSF-based biomarkers for AD, cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD),
large-vessel ischemic disease, and inflammation. In addition, we will perform state-of-the-art MRI imaging
incorporating biomarkers of AD, cSVD and neuroinflammation. We will also explore the utility of wearable
devices to collect digital biomarkers tracking sleep and physical activity, especially given that Lewy body
pathology can lead to early sleep disturbances. Finally, digital gait assessment will provide physical biomarkers
of gait, which has been shown to decline early in individuals with cSVD and Lewy body dementia. Importantly,
the Biomarker Core has been established for several years and is fully integrated within the UK-ADRC,
working closely with the other cores to maximize the utility of the biomarker data collected to date. We will
continue to support internal and external research projects on biomarkers, and will also contribute significantly
to national and international consortium efforts to develop clinic-ready biomarkers for AD, VCID, and other
underlying causes of dementia. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Collect bi-annual blood-based biomarkers of AD, cSVD, large vessel disease, and inflammation.
Aim 2: Collect baseline MRI scans and accompanying CSF ATN biomarkers on all cognitively normal
participants in the longitudinal cohort.
Aim 3: Fully characterize biomarkers on all participants at their clinical transition from cognitively normal /
preMCI to MCI, and from MCI to dementia.
Aim 4: Determine the utility of digital biomarkers including activity, sleep, and gait, in predicting cognitive
decline and / or brain pathology.
Aim 5: Contribute to national efforts to establish, harmonize, and standardize biomarkers including NACC,
ADNI, and NCRAD.
Aim 6: Integrate with the other cores of the UK-ADRC."

foundation in multidisciplinary team science, and an outstanding track record of success in mentoring and
education of researchers across the training spectrum. We will also establish a new REC Scholar program
aimed at junior investigators (Assistant Professors, senior research associates, or clinical fellows). This
program will support junior investigators from diverse, multidisciplinary fields to pursue mentored basic,
translational, or clinical research in ADRD, and follow a customized training plan to help the scholars move
toward their career development goals. This training will be done in a supportive and collaborative academic
environment with substantial training resources and an experienced and dedicated training faculty. Scholars
will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art research skills in disciplines that have been identified as
critically needed areas for the ADRC workforce of the future. Examples of training areas where the UK-ADRC
has strong expertise include analysis of longitudinal clinical outcomes, clinical trial design, MRI imaging and
novel fluid biomarkers, quantitative neuropathology and AD mimics, data analysis/ study design in mixed

10872206,"Project description
Neuroactive steroids (NAS) are important modulators of neuronal excitability with demonstrated therapeutic
efficacy as anesthetics and rapidly acting anti-depressants. While the anesthetic actions of NAS are mediated
by GABAA receptors, the mechanism(s) of their anti-depressant effect remains unknown. NAS functionally
modulate the activity of NMDA receptors and specifically bind several intracellular proteins that may contribute
to their anti-depressant actions. Notably, NAS also localize to trans-Golgi membranes, suggesting that they are
either selectively transported to Golgi or have an abundant selective binding partner in Golgi. The goals of this
project are to characterize NAS binding sites on putative anti-depressant protein targets and identify novel
intracellular NAS binding proteins that may contribute to the anti-depressant effects of NAS. To achieve these
goals, we will utilize NAS analogue photo-affinity labeling in concert with state-of-the-art protein chemistry and
expression techniques and cutting-edge mass spectrometry (MS) methods. The Evers lab has developed
these methods and successfully applied them to delineating the molecular details of NAS binding to VDAC, β-
tubulin and isoform-specific sites on GABAA receptors. Novel photo-affinity labeling reagents for this project will
be synthesized in the Chemistry Core. The output of our labeling studies will be identification of novel NAS
binding proteins and mutations in NAS binding sites that enable characterization of the role of these target
proteins in the anti-depressant physiological and behavioral effects of NAS (Projects 2 and 3). The Project has
two specific aims:
 In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the binding sites for NAS that are negative- and positive-
allosteric modulators (NAMs and PAMs) of NMDA receptors. GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors will be labeled
with NAM and PAM NAS photo-affinity analogues and the number of labeling sites on each subunit will be
determined using intact protein MS. The specific amino acids modified by the photolabeling reagents will be
identified using middle-down MS. Molecular modeling will be used, in conjunction with the photolabeling data,
to predict critical residues that may be necessary for NAS binding or effect. In Aim 2A we will perform an
unbiased search to identify the “proteome” of NAS binding proteins in intact hippocampal neurons using photo-
affinity labeling reagents with a “”click chemistry” tag to enrich binding proteins, followed by LC-MS/MS-based
protein identification. In Aim 2B, we will perform a focused proteomic search to identify cytosolic neuronal
proteins that selectively bind/transport NAS and may alter the lipid composition of organelle membranes and
modulate cellular stress responses. The physiological and behavioral effects of identified NAS-binding
proteins involved in cellular stress response pathways (Aim 2A) and NAS/lipid transport (Aim 2B) will be
evaluated using CRISPR knockout methods (Projects 2 and 3)."
10873188,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The ultimate goal of an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to promote innovative research on
dementia and its treatments while ensuring that patients and caregivers become the beneficiaries of resultant
advances. An effective Administrative Core is essential for transforming these goals into accomplishments. To
this end, the Administrative Core of the Northwestern ADRC will be guided by the following goals:
 1) Lead the day-to-day running of the ADRC and promote ""centerness"" so that ADRC components function
 cohesively and leverage dementia-related activities throughout Northwestern University.
 2) Maximize the utilization of ADRC resources to fit local and national priorities.
 3) Coordinate the adoption of UDS-3, the FTLD module, new clinical trials, and the increased emphasis on
 biomarkers, including structural and molecular imaging.
 4) Facilitate interactions with NACC, NCRAD, and national consortia such as ADNI and ADCS, the
 Alzheimer's Association, and relevant agencies within the City of Chicago and State of Illinois.
 5) Encourage innovative Development Projects, coordinate their review, and monitor the progress of those
 that receive ADRC funding.
To fulfill these goals, the Administrative Core will oversee the finances of the parent NIA P30 and of additional
contracts related to multi-center collaborations and clinical trials. It will be responsible for timely progress
reports related to these activities as well as the organization of the yearly Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
meeting. An equally important role will be to ensure that the ADRC as a whole meets all IRB and HIPAA
requirements and that it is in compliance with NIH policies for human subjects, animal welfare, scientific
integrity, data and sample sharing and financial policy. The Administrative Core is also responsible for
coordinating the interactions of the ADRC with NIA, other NIH components, other ADRCs, and relevant
agencies at the national, state and local levels. Within Northwestern University, the Administrative Core will
advocate the allocation of additional faculty, space and financial resources to dementia research."
10873192,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CLINICAL CORE
The Clinical Core will establish and maintain a cohort of extensively characterized individuals who have
volunteered to participate in research projects addressing brain aging and dementia. In the next 5-year cycle,
the Clinical Core of the Northwestern ADRC will continue to serve NIA and NAPA priorities for research on
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). At the same time, the Clinical Core will
leverage local research programs within our longstanding theme of heterogeneity of cognitive aging and
dementia, as reflected in the studies of unusually successful brain aging (SuperAging) and non-amnestic
dementias (e.g., primary progressive aphasia). The emphasis on Alzheimer's disease will shift to earlier onset
and pre-symptomatic stages with a view toward prevention trials. The SuperAging projects will explore factors
that promote resilience to aging-related involutional changes and resistance to the emergence of Alzheimer’s
pathology. The primary progressive aphasia program will help to clarify the biological diversity of Alzheimer's
disease and the principles of selective vulnerability in focal brain neurodegeneration.
In the next five years, the Clinical Core will support the following goals:
 1) Maintain a diverse cohort of 500 research participants characterized by the Uniform Data Set (UDS)
 enhanced with center-specific measures, followed annually, and committed to neuroimaging, tissue
 donation and participation in national collaborations through NACC, ADCS, ADGC, NCRAD, and ADNI and
 in local collaborations investigating cognitive aging and dementia.
 2) Promote areas of clinical and basic research where the Northwestern ADRC enjoys a national leadership
 role, such as SuperAging, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and other FTLD-spectrum dementias, and
 encourage new investigators from outside fields at Northwestern to collaborate on AD/ADRD research.
 3) Promote the 'therapeutic encounter' theme of the ADRC through the support of innovative non-
 pharmacologic interventions and establishment of long-term relationships between ORE Core social
 workers and Clinical Core participants for recruitment and retention.
 4) Sustain a training approach that capitalizes on the multidisciplinary 'centerness' of the Northwestern
 ADRC and that serves the mission of the Research Education Component through the cultivation of an
 environment where trainees from different disciplines (basic and cognitive science, neurology,
 neuropsychology, psychiatry, social work, and neuroimaging) train together in contiguous space."
10873196,"PROJECT SUMMARY - DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL CORE
The Data Management and Statistics (DMS) Core has an essential role in all activities of the Northwestern
ADRC, whereby all information generated through ADRC operations is stored, integrated and shared in a
systematic fashion; studies are provided with design expertise, and research results are analyzed and
presented optimally. During the past 5 years, the Northwestern ADRC has devoted considerable resources to
its DMS Core in ways that have enhanced its impact on intramural activities and streamlined interactions with
NACC and extramural collaborations. During the upcoming cycle, the DMS Core will be guided by three goals:
 1) To maintain an integrated and flexible state-of-the-art relational and secure database that provides
 efficient access to subject-based data for approved research projects and for transmission to NACC.
 2) To provide biostatistics expertise in research design and data analysis for all ADRC investigators,
 including fellows, graduate students and Development Project Grant applicants.
 3) To apply and develop innovative biostatistical approaches designed to address new developments within
 the Northwestern ADRC.
The DMS Core has undergone a profound transformation over the last five years in response to the evolving
needs of the Northwestern ADRC, NIA, NACC, and our many research collaborators. In collaboration with the
Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS), the DMS Core established a
state-of-the-art database with a robust set of tools that assist in the capture, curation, storage, searching,
sharing, transferring and analysis of data sets generated by all components of the ADRC. In addition, the DMS
Core participates in the design and interpretation of all ADRC research projects with a quantitative component.
Statisticians provide expertise in the generation of hypotheses and analyses of the results and participate in
the writing of grant applications as needed, formulating and writing the power calculations, setting up data
collection tools, monitoring data collection, and performing statistical analyses. The DMS Core will also apply
and develop innovative biostatistical approaches designed to address new research developments within the
Northwestern ADRC. Statistical consultation is available to all senior and junior investigators, postdoctoral
fellows, and predoctoral graduate students."
10817088,"Project Summary/Abstract
Therapeutic oligonucleotide compounds (e.g., siRNA, antisense) hold promise as transformative drugs for the
treatment of many genetically-defined neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's Disease (HD) and
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Therapeutic oligonucleotides silence disease genes by targeting and
degrading mRNA, thus preventing the expression of toxic gene products. The sequence specificity and long-
lasting effect of therapeutic oligonucleotides provide a powerful therapeutic paradigm, as long as they can be
delivered to the relevant target tissue. Funded by NINDS, we have identified two classes of therapeutic siRNA
that show robust distribution and efficacy in the central nervous system (CNS): di-valent siRNAs and lipophilic
conjugates. This discovery has resulted in transformative therapeutic candidates advancing towards formal
clinic investigation. Nevertheless, efficient, uniform, long-term, allele-selective, non-toxic delivery remains a
significant hurdle in expanding oligonucleotide drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders.
 This proposal aims to develop and characterize innovative chemistries that enable uniform distribution,
multi-target silencing, and intra-nuclear gene modulation in the CNS in vivo. This proposal describes a class of
multivalent siRNA compounds that exhibit complete metabolic stability, robust distribution in the spinal cord
and brain (rodents, sheep, NHPs) when infused via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), efficient uptake by neurons, and
potent and durable silencing without toxicity for at least six months after a single injection. While developing
CNS-active di-valent siRNAs, we developed stabilizing backbone chemistry called exNA. Here, we propose
structure-function studies to investigate how valency (above two), linker, and exNA-based stabilization affect
therapeutic activity. Remarkably, increased valency further reduces the rate of CSF clearance, while exNA-
based stabilization enhances the duration of effect. In addition, modulating the chemical architecture can shift
the intracellular distribution of siRNA from the cytoplasmic to the nucleus to target nuclear-localized mRNA.
Finally, the use of orthogonal chemistry to synthesize multi-targeting compounds is essential for treating
diseases with complex etiology.
 Completion of this proposal will: (i) optimize multivalent, ultra-stable configuration that supports uniform,
potent, specific, and durable multi-target silencing (longer than six months) in the central nervous system; and
(ii) establish a developmental path toward novel combinatorial treatments for HD and ALS. In addition, this
proposal seeks to establish a technology platform to directly target any gene or combination of genes
expressed in any region of the central nervous system. Successful completion of this work will therefore enable
studies of gene function in the central nervous system and the development of novel oligonucleotide-based
therapies for genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases."
10802395,"ABSTRACT
The vascular system is critical to life, infusing each organ of the body with oxygen and nutrients, and
transporting and interacting with immune cells that protect the body. In the adult, maintenance of an intact
vascular endothelium is under strict homeostatic control to prevent edema or hemorrhage. Wounding or tissue
hypoxia can result in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. The process of vascular homeostasis is highly
regulated and involves many molecular players acting in concert. Under disease conditions, orchestration of
these molecular processes may go awry. This is especially true in rare Mendelian disorders that are caused by
mutations in key components of this machinery, such as Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), which
is caused by loss of function mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4. Understanding the molecular
underpinnings that regulate vascular homeostasis is critical to many diseases, including susceptibility to, and
recovery from, acute lung injury and COVID-19. Here, we will investigate the role of protein tyrosine
phosphatase non-receptor, type 14 (PTPN14) as a critical player in regulation of both blood and lymphatic
vessel homeostasis. We previously showed that genetic variation within the PTPN14 gene associates with
pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in HHT patients, and human genetics studies suggest a role
for PTPN14 in lymphatic development and homeostasis. PTPN14 is an antagonist of YAP signaling and we
have shown that it supports ALK1(ACVRL1)/SMAD4 signaling. We have identified several cis-eQTL in the
PTPN14 gene that associated with PTPN14 expression and with the presence of pulmonary AVM in HHT,
suggesting that PTPN14 expression levels influence AVM incidence. We have also identified two rare non-
synonymous PTPN14 SNPs that segregate with AVMs and we will also determine how these affect PTPN14
function and molecular interactions with SMAD4 and YAP/TAZ. We will use human engineered microvessels
under flow conditions to investigate the effects of PTPN14 knockdown or mutation, with or without ENG or
ACVRL1 knockdown, on endothelial cell, size, proliferation, migration, alignment with flow, and vascular
permeability under differing flow conditions. Finally, we will use our Cre-mediated Ptpn14-loxp allele, generated
in-house, to investigate development of vascular and lymphatic malformations that result from genetic loss of
Ptpn14 in endothelial or parenchymal cells in vivo, and examine how PTPN14 interacts with the BMP9-
endoglin-ALK1 signaling pathway to modulate formation of AVMs in vivo. We will generate tamoxifen-inducible
cell type-specific Ptpn14-/- and investigate how this affects developmental angiogenesis, pathological
angiogenesis in wounded cornea, and vascular beds of adult lung, skin, liver, gut and brain. We will also
investigate the effects of Ptpn14DiEC on Eng+/-, EngDiEC phenotypes to determine how these genes interact in
vivo. Blood flow in the lung and potential arteriovenous malformations will be assessed using our new
Quantum GX2 micro-CT imager obtained through an S10 grant."
10850979,"Project Summary: Many patients now survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), however gaps in
knowledge about long-term outcomes result in a fragmented and underdeveloped continuum of care to achieve
recovery. Recovery is defined as significant improvement in functional and cognitive outcomes, and health-
related quality of life (HRQoL). OHCA Survivors with favorable recovery patterns may potentially go back to
work and/or social roles. Prior studies assessing recovery domains after OHCA are small, limited to single
centers, and short-term outcomes i.e., 1-3 months. Identifying individual patient patterns of recovery over
longer-term, and the ability to predict who will be likely to need more intensive support after discharge would
allow interventions to be targeted more efficiently. It is also crucial that we offer patients and their families the
best information available about a patient's prospects for continued recovery even in the absence of modifiable
intervention targets. This study will be among the first to focus on a new equitable science of OHCA
survivorship itself, seeking empirically derived targets for preserving or restoring recovery.
Our single-center pilot study has found that nearly one-third of the OHCA survivors had clinically important
differences between long-term (12 months) and short-term (3 months) functional outcomes with large between-
individual variability in recovery (i.e., improvement or worsening). We found that inpatient acute rehabilitation
was associated with better functional recovery patterns at 12 months compared to other dispositions, but Black
race and Hispanic/Latinx had worse recovery patterns than non-Hispanic Whites.
To fill this gap, we propose an ancillary study to the NINDS/NHLBI-funded ICECAP trial, conducted within the
60 sites of the NIH emergency care trials network, to describe recovery (functional outcome [primary],
Cognition, and HRQoL outcomes [secondary]) in a large, well-characterized, racially/ethnically diverse,
representative cohort of US OHCA patients. We will enroll n=1,000 who were screened for ICECAP and
survive to hospital discharge. The parent ICECAP trial includes a telephone follow-up visit at 1 month and an
in-person visit at 3 months. The ancillary study will add two telephone/videoconferencing visits at 6 and 9
months and an in-person visit at 12 months after OHCA.
For Aim 1, we will describe between-patient variability in recovery (i.e., improvement in functional, cognitive,
and HRQoL outcomes) from 3 to 12 months after OHCA, and test whether changes are associated with illness
severity scores, and critical care interventions performed during the acute care stay. Aim 2 will test whether
receipt of acute inpatient rehabilitation (vs outpatient therapy/no therapy/skilled nursing facility) within 1 month
of hospital discharge is associated with greater improvement in recovery outcomes from 3 to 12 months.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will test whether non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx patients have less favorable
changes in recovery outcomes between 3 and 12 months and explore mechanisms for such disparities."
10894836,"Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a neurological disorder that causes
disability in children and predisposes them to challenges later in life, including significant physical, cognitive,
and psychological disability. The trigeminal nerve extends from the central nervous system to innervate the
greater portion of face and eye, and may offer insight into head trauma pathophysiology. In particular, painful
sensitivity to light (photophobia), corneal nerve pathology, and atypical functional activity within the brain have
all been reported in preliminary work evaluating persons with mTBI and trigeminal nerve pathology. Our overall
hypothesis is that the trigeminal nerve is sensitive to mTBI and accounts for pain-related symptomatology. To
test this hypothesis, in aim 1, we will define trigeminal nerve pathology in persons with mTBI using quantitative
sensory testing (QST), in vivo corneal nerve microscopy (IVCM), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In aim 2,
we will define central nervous system changes to light-induced pathways with mTBI-related photophobia using
fMRI and DTI. This study is likely to yield (1) a diagnostic marker that is sensitive to mTBI, (2) evince a
neurological source of mTBI-related pain symptoms. Data generated from this investigation can be used to
improve the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients suffering from head trauma and provide an
objective marker to base clinical decision making."
10840347,"Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) disorders cause significant distress and often lack effective treatments. Although
dysmenorrhea is closely associated with 80% of cases of CPP, little is known about why only some women
with menstrual pain go on to develop conditions like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, irritable bowel
syndrome, or endometriosis. Intriguingly, 20% of dysmenorrhea sufferers (without chronic pain) display a key
feature of many CPP states, bladder hypersensitivity on noninvasive bladder filling, and appear on pilot studies
at higher risk of CPP in one year. In this team’s prior studies, women with the dysmenorrhea with bladder pain
phenotype (DYSB) also exhibit greater somatic symptom burden, experimental pain hypersensitivity, and
psychological dysregulation—features found in many chronic pain patients. As little is known about the acute to
CPP transition, this renewal application seeks to track pelvic pain symptomatology prospectively in DYSB
women and to expand those initial mechanistic studies. Aim 1 is a two-year longitudinal study of 1050 young
women oversampled for dysmenorrhea to find 150 DYSB cases and establish their risk trajectory for CPP
symptoms vs. those with only dysmenorrhea (DYS only = 750) and healthy controls (HC = 150). Along with a
virtual bladder filling screening test, other patient health factors potentially predicting development of CPP will
be captured, including overall pelvic experiences and general sensory sensitivity. Aim 2 will investigate 100
DYSB and 100 controls (DYS only and HC) on two dimensions of CPP mechanistically—bladder
hypersensitivity and multimodal hypersensitivity (a composite of experimentally evoked responses to
nonvisceral quantitative sensory tests [QST]). Electroencephalography-based studies will further investigate
which neurological mechanisms (i.e. ascending neural hyperexcitability, descending inhibition, and neural
oscillations) underlie these two components and predict one-year worsening of CPP symptoms. Aim 3 studies
whether another key mechanism of pain sensitization, Toll-like Receptor-4 inflammatory reactivity, influences
CPP progression, using an integrated whole-blood collection and leukocyte culture system. This renewal
application significantly extends this discovery of an at-risk phenotype by providing a method for
expanding screening and characterizing reversible mechanisms. This essential followup study utilizes
innovative combinations of QST with EEG measurements of brain activity to identify the mechanisms
responsible for CPP-related-sensory abnormalities, alongside measures of systemic inflammatory
reactivity that are strongly implicated in sensory hypersensitivity. Notably, if these are confirmed,
candidate early interventions already exist to modulate these mechanisms, including mindfulness meditation
and consistent anti-inflammatory use for dysmenorrhea. Successful completion of these studies would
accelerate efforts to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pelvic pain, a major public health priority."
10814854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
I am interested in developing novel treatment strategies for maintaining muscle mass and function in the
elderly population. My lab utilizes murine models of aging to investigate mechanisms on how aging-associated
loss of hypoxia signaling in skeletal muscle affects two key factors in maintenance of muscle mass and
function: (1) skeletal muscle regeneration and (2) adaptation to aerobic exercise. Prolyl hydroxylase domain
enzyme (PHD)2 increases profoundly in skeletal muscle with aging and is a key regulator of the hypoxia
signaling pathway. This increase in skeletal muscle PHD2 leads to loss of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1, a
central transcription factor responsible for downstream hypoxia pathway signaling. Using a murine model of
aging and genetically modified mice, we have demonstrated that a muscle specific increase in PHD2
recapitulates diminished skeletal muscle regeneration and loss of aerobic exercise adaptation as seen in
aging. Building on these intriguing pilot data, the central goals of this project are to (1) mechanistically define
the role of PHD2 and its impact on muscle regeneration in aging, (2) determine whether PHD2 inhibition
preserves skeletal muscle myogenic potential with aging, and (3) evaluate if increased skeletal muscle PHD2
in aging limits muscle adaptation in response to aerobic exercise. Importantly, transcriptome analysis in
humans also demonstrates decreased hypoxia signaling in old skeletal muscle, suggesting translational
potential for hypoxia signaling targets. As FDA approved PHD2 inhibitors are available, an improved
mechanistic understanding of hypoxia signaling as it relates to skeletal muscle regeneration and exercise
response may offer therapeutic opportunities for elderly patients suffering from loss of muscle function with
aging."
10849916,"Abstract
α-Crystallin is a complex macromolecule that accounts for nearly 40% of the adult lens proteins. The
chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin, which was discovered nearly three decades ago, is implicated as a key
component in the maintenance of lens transparency by suppression of crystallin aggregation. It was found that
the deletion of 21-28 and 54-61 regions of αB-crystallin leads to increased chaperone-like activity (activation,
gain of function). Understanding the molecular organization and properties of crystallin subunits in activated
chaperones would help answer questions on how α-crystallin chaperone-like activity might be harnessed and
manipulated for the development of protein-based therapeutics. It is hypothesized that the increased αB-
crystallin chaperone-like activity in deletion mutants stems from new type of oligomers where subunit–subunit
interactions lead to the exposure of “cryptic” chaperone sites in the native oligomers. Studies show a
recombinant αB-crystallin expressed after deleting either 54-61 or 21-28 and 54-61 sequences (resulting in a
protein designated as αBΔ54-61 and αBΔ21-28,Δ54-61) was found to form smaller oligomers than the wild-
type protein but to show up to ~25-fold increase in chaperone-like activity. The experiments proposed in this
proposal will uncover the molecular changes that drive the increased chaperone-like activity in αBΔ21-28,Δ54-
61 and αBΔ54-61. The aims of the application are 1) Uncover the molecular changes in the activated αB-
crystallins, (αBΔ54-61 and αBΔ21-28,Δ54-61), 2) determine the biological implications of enhanced
chaperone-like activity of engineered proteins in the cell culture and whole lens culture system. Novel
crosslinker(s) will be used to gain fresh insights into the “cryptic” chaperone sites getting exposed in the
activated crystallin. The studies will also make use of site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometric
analysis to uncover the molecular changes at subunit interaction level in activated oligomers. To see whether
the activated αB-crystallin can be exploited to protect cells from oxidative injury, the effects of stress-inducing
agents such as H2O2 and sodium iodate will be investigated in HEK293 and ARPE-19 cells in presence of
activated crystallins. Further, the ability of activated chaperones to suppress aggregation and toxicity of fibril-
forming β-amyloid will be investigated both in vitro and ex-vivo. The long-term goals of the studies are to
understand the structure–function relationship of activated αB-crystallins and develop crystallin proteins that
have therapeutic value in protein conformational diseases and oxidative stress conditions."
10813767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preterm infants are at risk for central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage which can disrupt cerebellar maturation
and lead to permanent neurodevelopmental impairment. The molecular signals in the disrupted neurovascular
niche that block cerebellar development are not known. Thus, no therapeutics are available to prevent the
developmental disabilities associated with preterm brain hemorrhage. Fibrinogen, a blood coagulation protein,
crosses a leaky blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is a key driver of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress,
neurodegeneration, glial scar formation, and inhibition of repair. We hypothesize that fibrinogen is a critical
component of the neurovascular niche after BBB disruption that blocks cerebellar development in preterm
infants. Our preliminary studies show: 1) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation in neonatal
mice increases vascular activation, fibrinogen deposition, and neuroinflammation in the cerebellum; 2)
Fibrinogen depletion rescues cerebellar growth in systemic neonatal inflammation and plasma injection models
of BBB disruption; 3) Fibrinogen inhibits neurogenesis from cerebellar granule neuronal progenitors (CGNPs)
and is sufficient to disrupt cerebellar growth in vivo; 4) Fibrinogen activates the bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) receptor activin A receptor type I (ACVR1) in CNS progenitor cells to inhibit remyelination and
neurogenesis; 5) Fibrin binds the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor on microglia/macrophages to induce pro-
inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways that are toxic to CNS progenitor cells and impair regeneration; 6)
fggγ390-396A knock-in mice, in which the binding site of fibrin to the CD11b integrin is mutated, have improved
cerebellar growth during systemic neonatal inflammation. Our specific aims will test our working model, whereby
fibrinogen deposition after BBB disruption alters cerebellar development through: 1) direct inhibitory effects on
CGNPs via ACVR1 signaling, and 2) activation of innate immune responses via CD11b. In Aim 1, we will define
the contribution of aberrant ACVR1 signaling to fibrinogen-induced cerebellar injury using CGNP-specific ACVR1
mutant mice and clinically relevant ACVR1 small molecule inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of fibrin-
CD11b-induced innate immune activation to cerebellar injury using fibrinogen mutant mice and a novel
monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of fibrin with CD11b. In Aim 3, we will define how fibrinogen-
ACVR1 signaling alters human cerebellar progenitor cell fate in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebellar
organoids using single cell transcriptomics. These studies will reveal molecular mechanisms at the
neurovascular interface that link BBB disruption to CNS progenitor cell dysfunction in preterm infant brain injury.
Thus, results from this proposal may open new treatment strategies to overcome the inhibitory neurovascular
niche in preterm infant brain injury as well as other neurologic diseases with BBB disruption and fibrinogen
deposition, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and traumatic injury."
10786145,"Project Summary / Abstract
 MS is a chronic neuro-inflammatory autoimmune disease that leads to demyelination and damage of
axons. A breakdown of immune tolerance mechanisms that permits activation of naive myelin-specific T cells is
considered an initial step in the pathogenesis. A number of pivotal studies have demonstrated that antigen Ag-
specific Tregs not only have a significant role in modulating autoimmune CNS disease, but can also be highly
effective at treating MS.2-6 Using the clinically proven adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, we have developed
an immunotherapy that restores Ag-specific tolerance in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the
animal model of MS, that is efficient at preventing disease.1 Importantly, we demonstrate the AAV
immunotherapy is capable of suppressing both clinical disease and inflammatory response in mice with
established disease ranging from mild to severe.
 In addition to primary pathogenic antigens implicated in disease initiation, neo-epitopes can emerge as
result of intra- and/or intermolecular epitope spreading during progression of EAE, and MS. The potential for
increasing multiplicity of anti-myelin autoreactivities imposes major difficulties in developing antigen-specific
therapeutic agents for MS. Not only because of the possibility that the primary target antigen and/or emerging
neo-reactivities may differ in different patients, but the that the potentially pathogenic autoreactivities to several
myelin antigens may occur in any one patient at any one time.7 Studies aimed at inhibiting the development or
progression of EAE associated with more than one pathogenic autoreactivity by antigen-specific
immunomodulation targeting have suggested that all relevant autoreactivities should be targeted for maximal
therapeutic effect.
 Unlike other approaches that require ex vivo T cell engineering and/or expansion of TCR/Ag-specific T
cells, by designing the AAV vectors to express the complete protein coding sequence (not just the
immunodominant epitope) of the autoreactive protein, our approach induces Ag-specific Tregs in vivo and
eliminates the need to identify HLA/MHC specific epitopes, making this approach unique and universally
applicable.
 Building on our previous results, the continuing hypothesis to be tested is that stable hepatic expression
of AAV-delivered neuroantigens will establish a robust and persistent immunological tolerance, mediated by the
in vivo induction and expansion of Ag-specific Tregs, can significantly reduce or stop disease progression in the
EAE model of MS."
10847425,"Project Summary
We propose a systems biology approach to investigate the connection between metabolism and the emergence
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in two prominent human pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphylococcus aureus, within the context of physiologically-relevant environments. Two of the most serious
threats for AMR, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cause more than 30,000 and 300,000 drug-resistant infections
per year in the United States, respectively [4]. The objective of this R01 application is to construct computational
metabolic network models of antimicrobial-resistant and -sensitive P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and to
experimentally validate model predictions of metabolic genes and pathways supporting their evolution towards
resistance. To combat opportunistic and nosocomial infections, antimicrobials have been developed for clinical
use; yet with every new antimicrobial introduced, the aforementioned pathogens have quickly evolved resistance
[12, 13]. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed to limit emergence and expansion of AMR in these
species. With a focus in this application on Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (S. aureus)
bacteria, we will compare metabolic functions supportive of antimicrobial resistance to evaluate whether the
metabolic genes and pathways observed to be critical are unique to an organism or a more general mechanism
of metabolic adaptation. We posit that a combination of phenotyping, computational modeling, and
analysis of clinical antimicrobial-resistant strains will reveal bacterial metabolic processes that are
central to the growth of antimicrobial-resistant microbes and can be modulated to select against growth
of antimicrobial-resistant populations. Data from our lab and others have recently found that antimicrobial-
resistant P. aeruginosa and S. aureus display systems-level differences in metabolism [2, 14-16]. Furthermore,
data collected from experiments will enable: novel approaches to integrate gene expression data with metabolic
network models for complex environments, ensemble methods that better account for uncertainty in metabolic
network reconstructions, and machine learning methods to delineate metabolic states that correlate with AMR
in clinical isolates. The significance of the proposed work lies in the mechanistic understanding of essential
genes, reactions, and substrate preferences that underlie the development of AMR in two clinically important
pathogens. Further, metabolic states will be characterized in clinical isolates to support the relevance of the
systematic interrogation of metabolic dependencies in the development of AMR. The knowledge gap this work
will address is the mechanistic link between metabolism and the development of AMR. With the successful
implementation of the proposed project, we will identify several potential therapeutic targets in clinically important
pathogens as well as establish a framework for how such computational model-driven approaches can be

 The first phase of this grant aimed to generate evidence to promote appropriate, safe, and effective use of
medications across the range of kidney function. We established a dedicated pharmacoepidemiology group
and investigated medication use across the spectrum of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in >5 million patients in
5 international health systems. We evaluated the risks and benefits of many common medications and
medication classes: metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), spironolactone, and rosuvastatin, among others. We identified large gaps in guideline-recommended
monitoring and medical management, such as the pervasive undertesting of albuminuria among patients with
diabetes and hypertension.
 In this renewal application, we expand the prior study population to include additional large health systems
covering approximately 25 million patients with measures of kidney function. We incorporate current data to
enable investigation of newer classes of medications, such as sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT2-Is). We extend expertise of the investigative team to include leaders in implementation science and
clinical decision support, allowing translation of findings back into local electronic health systems.
 The overall premise of the application is that, by using post-marketing real-world data, we can provide
essential evidence to inform optimal care practices for patients with or at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Using SGLT2-Is as the primary example, we propose first to identify gaps in care, quantifying the number of
patients not receiving SGLT2-Is who are recommended to do so under clinical practice guidelines. Next, we
identify subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from SGLT2-I therapy through a careful assessment of
risks and benefits across individual patient characteristics. Finally, we develop and refine clinical decision
support tools that identify high-risk patients in real time who are lacking SGLT2-I therapy. In summary, with the
overall goal of simplifying provider decision-making and optimizing medical treatment for patients with or at risk
for CKD, this renewal application proposes to identify gaps in care, refine target populations for beneficial
medical therapies, and translate knowledge to the point of patient care.

10833131,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) are among the most common reasons to see a urologist across the
lifespan and are often accompanied by psychological consequences, such as anxiety and depression.
Patients with LUTS may have a disrupted bladder–brain dialogue; they may say “I don’t even feel anything
until I am wet”. Better therapeutic options can emerge from a better understanding of the fundamental brain
circuits and cells that contribute to LUTS and that contribute to bladder–brain communication. A potential LUTS
etiology that merits closer study is early life urinary tract infection (UTI). Clinical studies in females (who have
UTIs 4x more often than males) show early life UTIs predict later life LUTS. Basic research on UTIs and other
bladder insults in adulthood suggest inflammation underlies acute LUTS and psychological consequences. For
example, adult systemic injection of cyclophosphamide (CYP) — the most common noninvasive (catheter-free)
way to model UTI-linked inflammation — leads to bladder and psychobehavioral dysfunction. However, there is
a striking absence of research on the role of early life UTIs in later life LUTS and psychological consequences.
Here we show for the first time that female mice experiencing repeated, early life cystitis after CYP have
bladder and psychobehavioral dysfunction in adulthood. These data fuel our hypotheses: Early life
CYP-induced cystitis induces bladder and brain inflammation, which disrupts bladder-brain dialogue and leads
to lifelong LUTS and psychobehavioral consequences; this later life bladder and brain dysfunction can be
reversed by manipulation of key brain circuits in adulthood. In Aim 1, we will define early life CYP-induced
inflammatory indices in bladder and brain across the lifespan. In Aim 2, we will determine early-life
CYP-induced functional changes in bladder and brain across the lifespan, launching off from our pilot data:
repeated, early-life CYP-induced cystitis leads to adulthood voiding dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior. We
will use pharmacologic tools to address the mechanism and specificity of these functional changes, and test for
anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes throughout life. In Aim 3, we will map and manipulate key
components of the brain circuits that contribute to bladder-brain dialogue. Using our proven abilities to assess
neuron activity in brain regions central to this dialogue (locus coeruleus, Barrington’s nucleus, frontal cortex),
we will record the activity of sets of neurons in freely-moving mice before and after voiding events in our early
life CYP model. We hypothesize that early life cystitis disrupts the ability of these neuron types to respond to
sensation from the bladder and thus discriminate voiding cycle stages. We will then attempt to reverse the
early life cystitis-induced bladder and psychobehavioral dysfunction in later life by optogenetically manipulating
the activity of relevant neurons in adulthood, as we have already done in adult models. Given the prevalence of
LUTS, the basic experiments proposed here have enormous potential to expand our understanding of how
neonatal cystitis influences the bladder-brain dialogue throughout the lifespan."
10828801,"Technologies that can closely monitor surgical recovery and wound healing for timely, proactive
treatments represent an essential keystone to developing next-generation personalized medicine that can further
reduce patient pain, prevent morbidity and death, and improve individual wellbeing. Microsurgical tissue transfer
entails surgical elevation of a portion of tissue (or flap) based upon its defined vascular supply in the form of a
single artery and vein. While this reconstructive strategy is well-accepted, failures do occur and almost always
result from early microvascular thrombosis. This flap-threatening event occurs in 6-14% of cases, and if
untreated flap necrosis and reconstructive failure are inevitable. The most common flap monitoring strategies is
serial physical examination and external doppler examination. However, these strartegies are limited by its
inherently subjective nature and the requirement for skilled bedside personnel to check the flap frequently. And
the intermittent assessment is subject to delay in the diagnosis of malperfusion, since clear signs of malperfusion
may take several hours to become obvious. Recent developments in wearable electronic sensors with built-in
systems on chip enable opportunities for real-time monitoring of physiological conditions of targeted tissues.
However, wearable biosensors that feature skin-interface pose a challenge: to sense physiological
parameters such as oxygenation of tissue microenvironments at depth. In the case of flap monitoring,
existing devices such as ViOptix are only able to monitor flaps which bear a cutaneous skin. This deficiency
means that muscle flaps must be monitored with indirect sensing technology through neighboring skin, which is
predisposed to delay recognition of muscle malperfusion.
 This absence of direct, real-time monitoring technology for muscle-only flaps gives rise to the
fundamental and overarching unmet clinical need: to advance technological platforms for deep-tissue
monitoring. We propose a soft wearable intelligent patch (SWIP) that incorporates microneedle waveguides
to enable deep-tissue sensing of oxygenation without implantation procedures for continuous monitoring of
recovery after microsurgical tissue transfer. We aim for the proposed device to enable physiological
measurements from 4 different locations of skin to yield both local (tissue oxygenation, pulsation intensity, and
blood flow rate) and global (pulsation rate and respiration rate) physiological information continuously and
simultaneously. The sensing interface will rely on biocompatible, optical waveguides in the form of microneedles
to enable light-matter interaction at deep tissue (~ 2 cm below the skin surface). The device will be equipped
with a control module that provides a series of signal pre-processing and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface
to advertise the data for further processing by a cloud-based computing device. We envision that the proposed
SWIP will advance diagnostic technology for reconstructive surgery and beyond, and offer real-time monitoring
to facilitate precise customization and personalization in surgical recovery and rehabilitation."
10781985,"5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an important RNA modification studied mostly for its role in tRNA biology. However, its roles in other aspects of RNA biology remain understudied. Our preliminary results, using bisulfite treatment of RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing, show that the genomes of many RNA viruses are m5C methylated in a site-specific manner, including Sindbis virus (SINV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The presence of m5C in diverse viruses, whose RNAs undergo many processes including translation, replication, transcription, and virion packaging, provides an attractive starting point for understanding the broader significance of this modification in regulating RNA function. A single dominant m5C site in SINV allowed us to generate an m5C-null mutant that exhibited cell-type dependent effects on virus replication. The host tRNA methyltransferase (MTase), NSUN2, which is important for host neuronal development and stem cell differentiation, appears to be the “writer” required for m5C modification of SINV. NSUN5, an MTase of ribosomal RNA is required for CVB3 methylation. We hypothesize that m5C plays a role in regulating viral RNA functions impacting virus-host interactions and viral life cycles. In three aims, using virologic, molecular, biochemical, high-throughput sequencing, and small animal model approaches: i) SINV will be exploited to learn how m5C is deposited and how it regulates RNA functions and viral infection and pathogenesis; studies of the related alphavirus CHIKV will allow conserved and virus-specific features to be uncovered, ii) how m5C regulates CVB3 RNA and what effects the modification has on virus replication and CVB3-associated myocarditis will be determined, and iii) SINV and CVB3 will be leveraged to characterize unknown functions of the NSUN2 and NSUN5 MTases, respectively, and as probes to discover novel m5C binding proteins that can exert their effect by direct binding (“readers”) or by removal of the m5C mark (“erasers”). This work will contribute to our understanding of human biology by revealing fundamental principles and functions of this widespread mark in the epitranscriptome with implications for its roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Since m5C methylation is a cellular process exploited by numerous viruses, this study could yield new targets for antiviral intervention."
10880233,"Background: Home health aides (HHAs) advance VA’s priority to honor Veterans’ desire to age in place by
improving health outcomes, reducing family caregiver burden and strain, and delaying or avoiding costly
institutional placement. Lack of adequate, stable HHA support for older Veterans is associated with loneliness,
depression and mortality. Improving access to HHA services is an urgent VA and legislative priority, and VA’s
HHA benefit is the health system’s most widely used and fastest growing home and community-based service
(HCBS). But because HHA care is purchased from community providers, navigating care can be complex and
fragmented. Ensuring stable, continuous HHA care thus demands a stakeholder-engaged systems approach to
better understand how Veterans navigate roadblocks and to identify potential interventions at the individual,
organizational and policy levels. My extensive research and professional experience with HHAs and my
qualitative training prepares me for this work. With mentorship and additional training in process improvement,
intervention development, implementation science, and trial design, I will leverage this CDA’s findings into a
bundle of actionable, multi-level interventions and advance my VA career.
Specific Aims: This proposed CDA simultaneously fills the gaps in my training and provides VA with rigorous
research on which to ground future interventions to strengthen Veterans’ caregiving teams in the home. This
work is guided by a theory-driven framework and supported by operational partners in GEC, Caregiver
Support, and Primary Care. Aims will: (1) Systematically describe the process of receiving and maintaining VA-
paid HHA services by identifying steps; individual, organizational and policy-level roadblocks; and promising
points of intervention. (2) Collaboratively adapt VA’s established Caregivers FIRST family caregiver curriculum
for VA-paid HHAs. (3) Conduct a pilot and formative evaluation of the intervention at the Bronx VA.
Methods: Aim 1: At 4 VAMCs diverse in geography, size, and HHA benefit structure, I will create process
maps using participatory methods with Veterans, caregivers, VA primary care teams, VA HCBS coordinators,
home health agencies and HHAs to prioritize potentially modifiable organizational factors to improve HHA
access. Aim 2: Through a stakeholder-engaged co-design process informed by previous pilot data and the
needs and barriers identified in Aim 1, I will develop an intervention to better prepare HHAs to provide Veteran-
centered care. Aim 3: I will use mixed methods to assess implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability,
usefulness) and HHA outcomes (preparedness). I will also examine potential downstream measures (caregiver
burden, Veteran days at home).
Expected Results and Next Steps: Throughout this study, I will provide my operational partners with key
deliverables, including HHA process maps and priorities for organizational-level interventions, and a scalable,
stakeholder-designed training program for VA-paid HHAs. Knowledge and skills developed through this CDA
will help me develop multi-site studies to more rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention and
address individual and organizational-level interventions through two proposed multi-site IIRs. Findings will
inform future research and action to improve the delivery and stability of HHA services and leverage the skills
of this critical workforce.
Significance and Relevance to Veterans’ Health: My study is innovative, timely, and responsive to VA and
legislative priorities. It addresses multiple HSR&D priority areas in Long-term Care/Aging and Disability, with a
focus on health systems issues and cross-cutting HSR methods, and shines light on a critical yet understudied
anchor of VA HCBS. This work comes at a critical juncture for VA as long-term care shifts to the community.
This study seizes these opportunities, systematically identifying needed improvements and launching a
promising intervention as a first step toward leveraging VA resources to support Veterans’ caregiving teams."
10802369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Histone proteins package DNA into chromatin and regulate all DNA-templated biological processes in
eukaryotes. Consistent with their essential function, mutations or misregulation of histones result in many
diseases. While core histones primarily function in genome packaging, histone variants can replace canonical
histones at unique genomic locations for specialized roles such as DNA damage response (DDR) or gene
expression. Despite their essential functions, histone repertoires have undergone distinct lineage-specific
changes. Such evolutionary novelty via gene fusions, duplications or sequence divergence is unexpected in
conserved protein families and suggestive of an adaptive advantage for sequence innovation. This proposal
will use evolutionary innovations in eukaryotic histone H2A repertoires to investigate the causes and
consequences of evolutionary turnover of histone proteins. The most common eukaryotic H2A repertoire is
made up of core histone H2A, and histone variants H2A.X and H2A.Z that are involved in DDR and gene
regulation, respectively. However, two evolutionary shifts, both likely selectively advantageous, have occurred
in yeast and Drosophila H2A repertoires. In yeast, H2A.X, entirely replaced canonical H2A, likely improving
DDR and affecting processes like meiosis that depend on DDR. In Drosophila, H2A.X fused with H2A.Z giving
rise to a unique H2Av variant. This fusion enriches DDR at heterochromatin which potentially restricts DDR-
based transposition events to gene poor regions. To identify functional consequences of these evolutionary
innovations, the applicant will re-engineer the ancestral eukaryotic H2A repertoire in yeast and flies.
Specifically in S. cerevisiae, the applicant will engineer a core H2A and two variants H2A.X and H2A.Z,
preventing H2A.X from being the core histone (Aim 1). In D. melanogaster, the fusion histone H2Av will be
separated into H2A.X and H2A.Z uncoupling DDR and gene regulation functions (Aim 2). Changes to
organismal chromatin packaging, and relevant biological functions including DNA repair, meiosis, fertility, and
transposition will be interrogated. In Aim 3, the applicant will apply tools learnt in Aims 1 and 2 to study
divergence of eukaryotic core H2A. Histones have tail sequences which are heavily post-translationally
modified and play crucial roles for higher order chromatin packaging and protein interactions. The high
sequence divergence across eukaryotic histone tails suggests that tails could facilitate unique lineage-specific
functions. By engineering different tail sequences in yeast and flies, Aim 3 will reveal changes to chromatin
packaging, and changes to processes such as mating, and quiescence in yeast, and fertility and development
in flies. To launch this work, the applicant requires training in genetics, genomics, and phenotypic assays in
two model organisms, yeast and flies. By leveraging, her expertise in evolutionary analyses and the power of
well-established tools in yeast and flies simultaneously, in the future the applicant will study the biological basis
and consequences of histone innovation including her own previous discoveries and co-evolving mechanisms."
10869975,"Axons and their associated glia (Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes) form the largest part of the neuronal
network. Axons are challening to maintain energetically and are vulnerable to a wide spectrum of noxious stimuli.
Dysfunction of axons and pathological axon degeneration (pAxD) have emerged as a major pathophysiological
driver in many neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, a central therapeutic focus is to develop approaches
tailored to protect axons. A prerequisite for such therapies is a better understanding of the autonomous and non-
cell autonomous molecular mechanisms that regulate the processes leading to pAxD. Physical disconnection of
the axon from the neuronal cell body is a widely-used experimental platform that has dramatically improved our
understanding of these processes over the last two decades. Primarily studied in the peripheral nervous system
of vertebrates, this paradigm triggers early injury responses in Schwann cells followed by rapid and stereotyped
disintegration of axons (Wallerian degeneration). It is now known that axon disintegration is evoked by a
conserved auto-destruction program that exhausts axonal ATP content through rapid depletion of the metabolic
cofactor NAD+ in disconnected axons. Importantly, recent studies indicate an instructive role of axonal
bioenergetics for the survival of injured axons. Given that neurodegenerative diseases are broadly associated
with axonal bioenergetic defects, these findings suggest that the decline of axonal bioenergetics occupies a
central position in the pathway leading to pAxD. In support of this, we recently made the exciting discovery that
Schwann cells convert their energy metabolism early upon axon injury to antagonize the structural breakdown
of injured axons, likely through the increased supply of glycolytic end-products (axon-glia metabolic coupling).
Furthermore, we found that the manipulation of the metabolic injury adaptation in Schwann cells accelerates or
delays the degeneration of perturbed axons in acute and subacute pAxD models. For the first time, this
demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous energetic mechanism that controls the fate of injured axons. The first aim
of this proposal attempts to determine if the suggested metabolic coupling mechanism counteracts the energetic
decline of injured axons through the enhanced supply of glial manocarboxylates that support axonal ATP
production. The next objective extends the identification of the key components of the metabolic coupling
pathway critical for the support of injured axons with an emphasis on axonal mitochondria. The final goal intends
to examine as to how manipulation of metabolic coupling influences pAxD in an iatrogenic disease model of
subacute axon pertubation. Collectively, this work has the potential to introduce a paradigm shift away from
neuron-centric views of axon protection. The proposed efforts may open the door for the future development of
novel therapeutic approaches taking into account the relationship between axonal and glial bioenergetics to
combat pAxD in neurodegenerative disorders.

Diabetes and its complications affect an ever-growing part of the global population. Recent studies point to
beta cell defects as a common denominator in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Here, we propose to interrogate
the contribution of distinct coping mechanisms present in beta cells that serve to protect against physiological
stress, but whose dysfunction can result in deterioration or destruction of beta cells under conditions of
extended or unresolved stress. We focus on the connections between ER stress resulting in the unfolded
protein response (UPR) and loss of beta cell identity caused by a novel regulator of beta cell identity. We
propose to determine how these pathways interact and how they inform beta cell function. The proposed work
is exclusively performed in human beta cells and takes advantage of our ability to generate and CRISPR-
modify functional insulin producing cells from human stem cell populations. The overall goal of our proposed
studies is to define the mechanisms resulting in beta cell dysfunction and subsequent diabetes, with a clear
focus on identifying those signaling nodes that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention. We have
assembled a team of leading experts on these specific cellular outcomes and have developed pharmacological
and genetic tools to address how halting stress response in beta cells can alter the course of the disease. We
pose that directly targeting stress response pathways in beta cells is an innovative and novel approach to
diabetes treatment and prevention that also has implications for other degenerative diseases."

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) include three major groups, ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3. The ontogeny of ILCs is
complex. ILCs are thought to differentiate from common lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow. Tissue-
resident ILCs are also believed to replenish the ILC pools. We and others have accumulated evidence
suggesting that ILCs can be made in the thymus and exported to peripheral tissues. Recently, by using single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we compared the transcriptomes of ILCs in the blood of wild type (WT) and
athymic nude mice and found that a substantial fraction of Lineage negative (Lin-) Thy1+ population was
dramatically reduced in nude mice, suggesting that these ILC precursors likely arise in the thymus. However,
this conclusion has not been verified using the lineage tracing experiment due to the lack of a suitable Cre
transgene that is specifically and efficiently expressed at early stages of T cell development. Our scRNAseq
data showed that these thymus-dependent cells express genes encoding CD3 chains, Cd3d, Cd3e and Cd3g.
Flow cytometric analyses detected CD3 intracellularly (icCD3ε) but not on the surface of Lin-Thy1+ cells of WT
but not nude mice. In peripheral tissues such as the lung and small intestine, icCD3ε+ cells were also found
but they are mostly immature ILC2s or other ILC subsets. We have evidence to suggest that CD3 expression
is down-regulated as the precursors differentiate into ILC2s. If thymus-derived cells can be permanently
labeled in the thymus using a lineage tracing system, we would be able to recognize them in peripheral tissues
even if they down-regulate Cd3 expression in tissues. The purpose of the R03 application is to establish a
lineage tracing system for detecting thymus-derived ILCs by creating Cd3-iCre knock-in mice and
testing the specificity and efficiency of iCre-induced tdTomato expression. There are two aims: (1) To
generate and characterize Cd3-iCre knock-in mice. We choose to make Cd3e-iCre and Cd3g-iCre mice
because of the different specificities and efficiencies of expression of the two Cd3 gene. The mice will be
generated by Applied StemCell Inc. Founder mice will be crossed with ROSA26stop-tdTomato mice. tdTomato
expression in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs will be examined. (2) To further validate the specificity and
efficiency of Cd3-iCre/ROSA26stop-tdTomato mice. We will perform bone marrow transplant using bone marrow of
Cd3-iCre/ROSA26stop-tdTomato mice as donors. The recipients will be the athymic nude mice and their
heterozygous controls. tdTomato expression in the recipients will be examined. In addition, we will validate
our scRNAseq data of WT and nude small intestine ILCs by scRNA sequencing the same cells from the
reporter mice to test if thymus-dependent clusters express tdTomato and the efficiency of expression. In short,
establishing this system will provide a powerful tool for studying the function of thymus-derived ILCs and
solidifying a new paradigm of ILC ontogeny. This system will also be useful to others in the field of early T cell
development."
10848420,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Development of rehabilitation interventions that are both effective and appropriate for patients with severe
upper limb paresis remains a major unmet clinical need. These patients have little to no volitional movement
and therefore are left with a non-functional upper limb. Many rehabilitation therapies are inappropriate for this
sub-population because they require significant residual movement. We have developed and tested a new
therapy that can be delivered in patients with little to no residual hand/finger motion. Known as contralaterally
controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES), the technique applies neuromuscular electrical stimulation
(NMES) to paretic wrist, finger, and thumb extensors to produce hand opening. The patient controls the
intensity of stimulation by wearing a glove with sensors on their unaffected contralateral hand. When the
patient opens their unaffected hand, a proportional intensity of stimulation opens their paretic hand. Therefore,
no residual movement of the paretic hand is necessary, which allows even patients with severe paresis to
engage in functional task practice using the affected upper limb. We have shown in a recent RCT that CCFES
is more effective than conventional NMES at reducing upper limb motor impairment in severe patients. But
patients continue to experience limitation in functional abilities. The goal of this study is to build upon the gains
achieved with CCFES in severe patients by augmenting its effects with another technique we have shown to
facilitate improvements in this sub-population. Non-invasive brain stimulation delivered to facilitate the intact
contralesional higher-motor cortices (cHMC) can have positive effects on upper limb motor control in severe
patients. When extensive damage to ipsilesional corticospinal pathways renders the damaged ipsilesional
primary motor cortex (iM1) ineffective at controlling paretic limb movement, intact, contralesional motor cortices
especially the cHMC can contribute by changing the balance of interhemispheric inhibition between motor
cortices and by increasing the excitability of uncrossed projections from the contralesional cortex to the paretic
upper limb. Therefore, here, we will test the scientific premise that CCFES augmented with facilitation of cHMC
will lead to greater upper limb motor improvement in severe patients than CCFES augmented with
conventional facilitation of iM1 or than CCFES alone. Seventy-two patients with severe hand impairment will
receive 12 weeks of CCFES + cHMC facilitation, CCFES + iM1 facilitation, or CCFES + sham brain
stimulation. Assessments of upper limb motor function and neurophysiology will be completed at baseline, 6,
12, 24, and 36 weeks. This study will 1) determine whether cHMC facilitation augments the effects of CCFES
to produce greater improvements in upper limb function in severe patients, 2) investigate the underlying
neurophysiologic mechanisms contributing to restored paretic limb motor control, and 3) evaluate and identify
patient factors that affect efficacy of CCFES + cHMC facilitation.

Human genome studies continue to provide new insights into heart, lung, and blood (HLB) traits, with
opportunities for translation of research findings for disease prevention and health promotion. Yet, an insufficient
number of HLB genetic epidemiologists can design and implement multidisciplinary HLB genetic epidemiology
studies that combine technological advances in genomics with cutting-edge statistical tools to advance
understanding of the genetic basis of HLB traits and associated diseases across populations. The Genetic
Epidemiology of Heart, Lung, and Blood Traits (or GenHLB) Training Grant addresses these research gaps by
providing interdisciplinary, integrated, and comprehensive instruction in the genetic epidemiology of HLB traits
from an outstanding team of research mentors with expertise spanning four training dimensions: HLB genetic
epidemiology; computational methods; `OMICs; and culture, diversity, and disparities. The training program
encompasses formal didactics based on an individual development plan, tailored mentorship, research in two
training dimensions, presentations, manuscript and grant preparation, research seminars and colloquia, and
instruction in the responsible conduct of research and research rigor and reproducibility. The GenHLB training
program also includes careful evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of the program, ensuring that fellows
achieve the competencies and skills necessary for success as future HLB genetic epidemiology research
leaders. This renewal application proposes continued support of three pre-doctoral and three postdoctoral
fellows each year. Postdoctoral fellows have prior expertise in epidemiology, human genetics, biostatistics,
bioinformatics, computational biology, or medicine and gain interdisciplinary training. Pre-doctoral fellows pursue
a PhD in epidemiology, specializing in HLB genetic epidemiology with a second area of training. Both applicant
pools are highly selective. During our first cycle of funding, the 11 fellows trained by our program successfully
conducted transdisciplinary research, published in leading journals, secured independent funding, and obtained
competitive positions interrogating the genetic epidemiology of HLB traits. For the next five years, we propose
an expansion of the computational training dimension to include a focus on causal inference and a research
theme of precision medicine. Specifically, we include faculty with expertise in causal inference and added
coursework and practicum experiences in precision medicine. An enhanced focus on lung and blood traits,
leadership training, and participation in an interdisciplinary public health professional development seminar
series also is proposed. Our program of internationally known research mentors with established research
collaborations, unique and multidisciplinary training environment, and a multitude of research opportunities make
us exceptionally well-positioned to continue training the next generation of genetic epidemiology leaders who
are well-equipped to investigate the genetic underpinnings of HLB traits and associated diseases."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and
recent large-scale human studies have implicated a link between exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) and CVD. However, how exposure to EDCs and other environmental chemicals influences CVD risk is
still poorly understood, and continues to hamper assessment of the health risks of EDC exposure. With the
NIEHS funding support, we have identified many EDCs as potent agonists of the xenobiotic sensor pregnane X
receptor (PXR). The identification of EDCs as PXR ligands has provided an important tool for the study of new
mechanisms through which EDC exposure impacts disease. Our laboratory was the first to reveal the novel
function of PXR in the regulation of atherosclerosis development, and has also demonstrated that widely-used
EDCs including bisphenol A, dicyclohexyl phthalate, and tributyl citrate increase atherosclerosis and
dyslipidemia through PXR signaling in various mouse models. Influences of the chemical environment on
human health have become the subject of intense interest but very few studies in the EDC research field have
focused on atherosclerosis development. My diverse scientific training in molecular biology, toxicology,
pharmacology, and cardiovascular research has put me in a unique position to investigate how “gene-EDC
interactions” affect atherosclerosis development and lipid homeostasis. This EDC-Induced CVD
Revolutionizing Innovative, Visionary Environmental health Research Program (EICVD-RIVER) will allow me to
investigate the broad scientific theme of the impact of EDC exposure on lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis
in adults and their offspring. EICVD-RIVER will address the following specific scientific questions: 1) How many
common chemicals in plastic and other consumer products act as EDCs to modulate PXR activities? Can
different EDC mixtures synergistically activate PXR? 2) Through which cell-specific mechanisms do EDCs
induce dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis? 3) How does PXR regulate ceramide homeostasis to affect EDC-
induced atherosclerosis? 4) Do microplastics have a Trojan Horse effect on EDC-induced atherosclerosis?
Can they bring EDCs intracellularly to have synergistic or additive impact on PXR-mediated atherosclerosis? 5)
Does paternal exposure to PXR agonistic EDCs affect the atherosclerosis development of the offspring? How
does PXR signaling alter the sperm RNA code to increase CVD risk of the offspring? The proposed studies will
contribute to our understanding of gene-EDC interactions in predisposing individuals and their offspring to
CVD, and my expertise and experience are an ideal fit for the RIVER mechanism that supports a multi-
dimensional long-term study of the proposed research."
10821484,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Secreted proteins and polypeptides mediate fundamental axes of cell and tissue
crossltalk. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in profiling the entire collection of secreted proteins
and proteins (e.g., the secretome) from cells and organs in vivo. To address this challenge, we have recently
described a high-sensitivity proximity labeling methodology using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to delivery
the proximity labeling enzyme TurboID into distinct subcellular compartments for cell type-specific secretome
profiling in vivo. Our methodology provides a direct biochemical readout of secretome composition and dynamics
in a cell type-specific manner, directly in a living animal. Here, we will generate and validate a suite of conditional
mouse models based on this secretome profiling methodology. This application and our proposed suite of
conditional secretome labeling mice directly responds to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-19-369
which encourages the development of improved animal models and novel technologies to better understand
health and disease. These conditional mice are important to develop because many cell types still cannot be
transduced efficiently or quantitatively with AAVs, or are rapidly turned over such that transient AAV infection
does not result in stable labeling of those cellular populations. In Specific Aim 1, we will generate three
conditional secretome labeling mouse lines with TurboID localized to the secretory pathway, cytosol, or
membrane and use shotgun proteomics to benchmark their performance relative to our first-generation viral
reagents. In Specific Aim 2, we will use these conditional mice to address a fundamental and well-defined
question that had previously remained inaccessible experimentally: to what extent are the levels of secreted
proteins determined transcriptionally in vitro? Successful completion of this proposal will provide investigators
with a conditional animal model to answer previously inaccessible and fundamental questions regarding the
identity of secreted protein and polypeptide factors mediating cell and tissue crosstalk in their experimental
system of interest."
10844483,"The purpose of this project is to determine if the relationship between a history of childhood maltreatment (CM)
and suicide risk is associated with alterations in the expression and epigenetic modification of specific
microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby providing a molecular signature of suicide risk in people with a history of CM. We
propose that whereas both major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidality are complex phenotypes, CM alters
the risk threshold for both. Epigenetic changes caused by early stressful events can induce long-term alterations
affecting networks of genes. miRNA expression represents one of the central mechanisms for environmental
regulation of gene expression. miRNA sequences themselves are epigenetically modified. The sum of these
effects may explain long-term cellular (mal)adaptations which may lead to suicide vulnerability in the CM

found that these exosomes were not only enriched with brain expressed miRNAs, but also showed a unique set
of miRNAs that were associated with CM and suicidality. Changes in the same set of miRNAs were also noted
in the brain of suicide subjects with a history of CM. In addition, suicidal subjects with and without CM showed
differential regulation of miRNAs in response to acute stress, a short-term risk for suicidal behavior, particulay in
the context of CM. Moreover, miRNA expression changes were highly correlated with exosomal miRNA promoter
methylation. Based on our preliminary data, we propose an overarching hypothesis that there are multiple
paths to suicidal behavior, and CM represents a unique path that is associated with altered expression and
epigenetic modification of a specific set of miRNAs and concomitant downstream specific target genes and
network(s). To test this, we will: 1) identify a set of neural-derived exosomal miRNAs that are associated with
the interaction of suicidality and CM severity while controlling for the independent effects of suicidality, CM, and
MDD; 2) examine whether an acute experimental stressor differentially impacts the expression of neural-derived
exosomal miRNAs in suicidal patients with and without CM; 3) use bioinformatic tools to examine potential
mechanisms by which altered neural-derived exosomal miRNAs may contribute to CM-associated suicidal
behavior; and 4) examine if changes in CM-associated miRNAs are explained by modifications in their DNA
methylation. In participants (n=450; replicated in a cohort of 350 subjects) across the spectrum of MDD, suicide,
and CM severity, we will test for the main effects of each, and identify a subset of miRNAs that are associated
with suicidality and CM severity. We will also test for the independent main effects of CM or suicidality on miRNAs
and the interactions among those factors. Altogether, using a distinct study population, unique neural-derived
plasma exosomes, and innovative molecular, biostatistical, and bioinformatic tools, our study will identify: 1)
neural-derived plasma exosomal miRNAs as a novel biosignature of suicide risk in the context of CM that can
be tested in longitudinal studies, and 2) potential mechanisms by which CM can act as a risk factor for suicidality."

The Fogarty African Bioethics Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is an 18-month long advanced bioethics
postdoctoral training program for scholars from sub-Saharan Africa who hold a bioethics-related PhD. This D43
renewal is a collaboration between Johns Hopkins University (USA), Makerere University (Uganda), and
University of Oxford (UK). The program will deepen trainees' academic and scholarly skills in bioethics, foster
leadership capacity, and create individual and group bioethics networking opportunities. Its substantive focus
is in the area of global health ethics, with an emphasis on global infectious disease ethics and advanced
research ethics. Ten postdocs will spend modular, dedicated time in each of the above institutions, and in
their home institution, completing individual and collaborative scholarly writing, organizing a global health
ethics leadership project, and engaging in global bioethics professional networks. The first 4.5 months of
training will be hosted at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics completing courses and seminars;
preparing bioethics manuscripts; engaging in team science; interacting with a vibrant community of bioethicists;
and drafting a formal plan for their leadership project. Fellows will spend one month at the University of Oxford
Ethox Centre where they will learn different approaches to bioethics, make additional professional connections,
receive additional mentoring, become integrated into the Global Health Bioethics Network, participate in the
well-attended Oxford Global Health & Bioethics International Conference, and work with faculty and fellows to
organize a workshop on emerging topics in global health ethics. During the 11.5 months at home, fellows will
focus on strategy, implementation, and management of their leadership project while participating in biweekly
mentoring sessions and presenting their works-in-progress to colleagues in their home institutions. They will
join quarterly global health ethics leadership webinars – a resource that will be shared widely – and engage
several times virtually with program alumni and Africa-based bioethics scholars to organize an African
Bioethics Scholars Network (ABSN). Fellows will spend the final month of the fellowship at Makerere University
(Uganda), where the core activity will be hosting a hybrid meeting of the ABSN, during which fellows will
present research and leadership projects and interact with others they invite for engagement. They will then
participate in the Annual National Research Ethics Conference (ANREC), hosted annually by the Ugandan
National Council for Science and Technology; network with the community of bioethics faculty at Makerere;
and teach Fogarty trainees. The “glue” of the fellowship will be consistent mentoring, support, and feedback for
every postdoc by program faculty and local mentors. By leveraging our experience and longstanding
commitments to advanced bioethics training, along with well-developed institutional relationships, we propose
this highly collaborative post-doctoral program to further advance the analytic thinking, visibility, leadership
capacity, and professional networks of the top doctorally-trained bioethics scholars from sub-Saharan Africa."
10772162,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to investigate a novel role of CELF2 in suppressing interferon responses to self-
RNA ligands. While interferons (IFN) induced by non-self-viral RNA activate an antiviral program to restrict viral
pathogens, their aberrant expression can cause tissue damage leading to autoimmunity. Although the toll-like
receptors and RIG-I-like receptors normally sense non-self RNA, these sensors are also activated by self-RNA
under certain conditions. Recognition of self-RNA can be a consequence of a failure of the suppression of the
self-RNA ligands. RNA editing by ADAR1 is one pathway used to suppress self-RNA ligands, but it is
conceivable that there are many other mechanisms that suppress endogenous immunostimulatory RNA
ligands. We made a surprising observation that the loss of splicing factor CELF2 induced a robust induction of
type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes. Splicing factors are required for mRNA processing and post-
transcriptional regulation, however the effect of aberrant and alternative splicing on IFN responses is
understudied. We found that IFN induced during CELF2 depletion is dependent on RIG-I-like receptors. In this
proposal, we will identify the mechanisms of CELF2-mediated suppression of IFN activation. CELF2 has not
been previously implicated in suppressing immunostimulatory self-RNA ligands. This study will describe a
novel role for CELF2 in innate immune signaling, but also study the effect of perturbation of mRNA splicing on
innate immunity. This study has the potential to uncover mechanisms of the biogenesis of endogenous RNA
that activates the RLR pathway. These findings could have a significant impact on understanding IFN-induced
immune pathologies and identify new therapeutic targets in autoimmunity."
10835105,"The global epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is progressing at an alarming rate. CKD affects an estimated 37 million people in the U.S. (15% of the adult population; more than 1 in 7 adults), and this number has more than doubled in the last two decades. Kidney-related diseases are rapidly eluding present treatment options and resources. The three common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. We and others have implicated soluble urokinase activating receptor (suPAR) as one of the significant risk factors for both, the onset as well as the progression of CKD, regardless of its etiologies. In addition to its role as a biomarker, we and others have suggested that suPAR is a pathogenic/scarring factor that underlies podocyte injury by activating v3 integrin on podocytes. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells essential for maintaining the specificity of the kidney filter. Our preliminary data suggest that the presence of the proteolytic fragment of suPAR, D2D3 fragment, in the plasma induces glomerular injury by activating v3 integrin on podocytes. In addition, and highly unexpectedly, our preliminary studies suggest that the D2D3 fragment also injures -cells of the pancreas. Together, these insights suggest a hypothesis that circulating D2D3 fragment simultaneously causes injury to two organs, the kidney and pancreas. We test this hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we define the physiological mechanisms by which D2D3 induces kidney and pancreas injuries by examining organ functions in D2D3-Tg mice on regular- and high-fat- diet challenged by nephrotoxic serum or Adriamycin. In addition, we will cross D2D3-Tg mice with Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice to examine synergy upon pancreas injury. Anti-suPAR antibodies and small molecules that target regulatory GTPases (dynamin, Cdc42, Rac1), whose roles will be elucidated in Aims 2 and 3, will be tested as potential therapeutics. As D2D3-Tg mice exhibit dual organ injury, combination treatments targeting diverse pathways in distinct cell types will also be investigated. In Specific Aim 2, we examine the effects of the D2D3 fragment on the actin cytoskeleton, regulatory GTPases, mitochondrial function, and gene expression in terminally differentiated and primary podocytes in the presence and absence of lipotoxic stimuli or high glucose levels. We focus on the effects of D2D3 on a feedback loop between the actin cytoskeleton and mitochondrial function, and its modifications by changes in podocyte physiology. In Specific Aim 3, we examine the effects of D2D3 on glucose uptake, intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, cytoskeleton dynamics, and gene expression in -cells, isolated mouse islets, and tissue slices. The proposed study, delineating molecular mechanisms and the physiological relevance of dual organ injury, is a critical step in developing novel mechanism-specific therapeutics for CKD and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."

Decreases in cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and impairment of neurovascular coupling are
associated with a number of neurodegenerative disease and cognitive decline, including Alzheimer’s
disease
and may precede or exacerbate disease. These deficits are also accompanied by loss of glutamate
transporters, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) isoforms, and deficits in mitochondrial dynamics and
 Over the last few years, we have demonstrated that astrocytic Glu transporters couple to
increases in intracellular Ca2+ through reversed operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX). We demonstrated
that mitochondria co-compartmentalize with Glu transporters in astrocyte processes and that
mitochondrial positioning relative to Glu transporters and synapses is dependent upon Ca2+ and that
mitochondria shape Ca2+ signal. Moreover, we found that glutamate transport is sufficient to evoke
increases in arteriole diameter (transporter-dependent NVC) downstream of reversed NCX. These and
other observations have prompted the central hypothesis that Glu transport and reversed Na+/Ca2+
exchange form a functional signaling pathway in astrocytes that is modulated by mitochondria and that
excessive activation of this pathway contributes to pathology observed during the development of AD. In

local application of glutamate transporters, and selective manipulation (genetic and pharmacologic) of

10848389,"Project Summary/Abstract
Albeit periodontal disease is a local chronic infectious inflammatory process affecting tissues supporting teeth,
it can also have systemic consequences. Along these lines are reports that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is
epidemiologically associated with periodontal disease. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this association are
not delineated. Our preliminary studies provide new evidence that a keystone periodontal pathogen
Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) could enter the brain and exacerbate amyloid-b (Ab) accumulation,
neuroinflammation, microglia activation, synapse loss, and cognitive and behavioral impairments in AD mice
upon oral gavage infection. Microglia are the primary innate immune cells in the brain, and microglial
activation is an invariable feature of AD pathology. The complement system also represents a major part of
innate immunity, and microglia have been identified as the dominant source of C1q, the initiation factor of the
classical complement pathway, in the brain. The objective of this application is to understand the importance
of periodontitis in regulating microglial in AD, and the role of complement component C1q in microglial
activation and AD progression. Based on the literature and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that
periodontal infection and inflammation not only increase the severity of AD, but also increase the risk of AD,
via potentiating Ab-primed microglial activation and sensitizing microglia for a heightened inflammatory
response to subsequent pathogenic stimuli. In addition, periodontitis-associated persistent C1q activation is
critical for microglial priming and activation, and the increased neurodegeneration in AD. We will test our
hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how periodontitis regulates microglial
activation in AD using three different models of periodontitis. Aim 2 will determine the role of complement
component C1q in microglial activation and AD development following Pg infection. Our proposed studies
will provide novel and significant insights into the association between periodontal infection and AD.
Understanding how a prevalent chronic infection like periodontitis modulates complement and microglial
activation will advance our understanding of the mysterious etiology of AD. The knowledge obtained from
these studies will provide a basis for targeting microbial etiology and periodontal therapy to ameliorate the
clinical manifestations of AD and lower AD prevalence."

10784749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuronal or axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS), caused by injury or diseases, is irreversible
and may lead to persistent neurological deficits. Spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes severe sensory and motor
dysfunction and paralysis. Of approximately 1.9% of the U.S. population living with paralysis, over 1,275,000 are
paralyzed as the result of SCI. Currently, there is still no cure for the injured spinal cord itself, emphasizing the
desperate need to identify novel pathways for targeted therapy.
Regarded as the holy grail in regenerative medicine, achieving axon regeneration and functional recovery after
CNS injury or in neurodegenerative diseases remains a daunting task. The inability of CNS axons to regenerate
after injury is attributed to the reduced intrinsic growth capacity of neurons and the inhibitory milieu largely
constituted by the reactive glial cells. It is conventionally thought that the structural formation of glial scar and its
upregulation of the repulsive CSPGs are the main culprit leading to stalled regrowth. However, accumulating
evidence in the past decade has demonstrated that preventing astroglial scar formation following CNS injury
does not result in increased regrowth. It is proposed that glial scar is important in preserving tissue integrity and
mitigating further inflammatory damage. Glial scar may have beneficial effects during the acute phase of injury,
but prevents axon regrowth in the chronic or later stages. In our latest work, via glia-specific metabolic
reprogramming, we succeeded in mitigating their adverse effects while enriching their promotive functions. We
demonstrated that glial reprogramming enhances glial glycolysis, and the production and release of metabolites
– lactate and L-2HG, which act through neuronal GABABRs to boost axon regeneration. However, major gaps
remain: are lactate and L-2HG the only pro-regeneration metabolites; do anti-regeneration metabolites also exist;
do glia subtypes behave similarly after metabolic reprogramming. Our published work allows us to ask the
essential question: does metabolic status dictate glia’s ability to promote or inhibit CNS axon regeneration? This
would have a fundamental impact on our understanding of axon regeneration, as it applies to all species across
the evolution spectrum. An equally intriguing question is: does the metabolic status differ between regeneration
competent and incompetent CNS neurons? Our proposal aims to answer these questions, and test our
hypothesis that glial and neuronal metabolic status governs the regeneration capacity of CNS neurons.
Although various strategies to boost the neuronal intrinsic regenerative ability, to remove the extrinsic inhibitory
factors such as CSPGs, to transdifferentiate glia into neurons, or to transplant stem cells into CNS have been
reported, none of them have translated into clinical use. There is still a pressing need for new concepts to
promote CNS axon regeneration. Our pilot results demonstrate that the state of glial cells that promotes axon
regeneration can be achieved by reprogramming. This project aims to uncover metabolic enzymes as therapeutic
targets, and metabolites or their derivatives as potential pharmacological agents for treating CNS injury."
10907693,"Abstract
 Inhibition of intestinal mucosal growth occurs commonly in various critical surgical disorders, particularly
in patients who undergo massive gastrointestinal surgical resections and are then supported with total
parenteral nutrition (TPN). Disrupted mucosal renewal impairs gut barrier dysfunction and leads to sepsis
and, in some instances, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Effective therapies to preserve
the intestinal epithelial integrity in patients with critical surgical illnesses are limited, as the mechanisms
that regulate gut mucosal renewal in stressful environments are poorly understood. With on-going support
for this project, our group was the first to implicate RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in gut mucosal growth and to show that dysregulation of RBP HuR and lncRNA uc.173 impairs
epithelial renewal, compromises epithelial host defenses, and disrupts the intestinal barrier. However, it
remains unknown how dysregulated HuR and uc.173 affect growth of the intestinal mucosa and how these
findings can be exploited to benefit patients with critical surgical illnesses. Rapid self-renewal of the
intestinal mucosa is driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) located at the crypt base. Paneth cells (PCs)
constitute the niche for ISCs in the small intestine and provide multiple secreted (WNT, EGF) and surfaced-
bound (Notch ligand) niche signals essential for ISC maintenance and function. Mitochondrial homeostasis
is essential for sustaining the PC/ISC niche, whereas disrupted mitochondrial function leads to PC defects
and ileitis. Our preliminary studies indicate that defects in PCs induced by targeted HuR deletion or uc.173
silencing resulted in the concomitant loss of ISC activity in vivo as well as ex vivo and that HuR knockout
and uc.173 inhibition also caused mitochondrial dysfunction, along with reduced levels of WNT3 and Notch
ligands in PCs. Building on these exciting observations, we now propose the paradigm-shifting hypothesis
that HuR and uc.173 regulate the PC/ISC niche by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, in turn
regulating intestinal mucosal renewal and adaptation in critical surgical diseases. Two specific aims are
proposed to test the hypothesis: 1) to define the exact role of the PC/ISC niche in HuR/uc.173-regulated
intestinal mucosal growth under critical surgical conditions; and 2) to determine if HuR and uc.173 regulate
PC/ISC niche function by modulating mitochondrial metabolism in response to critical surgical stress.
Completion of these specific aims will uncover novel mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of intestinal
mucosal growth inhibition in patients with critical surgical disorders. It will also establish a fundamental
basis for developing new effective therapeutics to promote gut mucosal growth/adaptation by targeting the
PC/ISC niche activity via HuR and uc.173."
10874758,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a powerful mediator of morbidity and an independent predictor of death due to
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Specifically, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a powerful predictor of
adverse outcomes. In this application we propose that the accumulation of Factor D (FD), which is filtered by the
kidney and activates the alternative pathway (AP) of complement, represents an acquired dysregulation in the
AP which then contributes to CVD and CKD progression. We compared the proteome of CKD patients to healthy
controls. The strongest signal we observed was for components of the AP pathway. CKD patients had
significantly higher levels of FD in circulating microparticles (sub-micrometer membrane vesicles that are shed
from cells in response to activation or injury) and higher levels of Ba in the plasma (Ba is a biomarker of AP
activation). FD activates the AP resulting in the generation of complement fragments including Ba. Factor H (FH)
is the main inhibitor of the AP, but CKD was not associated with differences in the levels of FH. Our in vivo data
indicate that even small increments in FD, if unopposed by adequate levels of FH, result in systemic AP
activation. Furthermore, we found that plasma Ba levels are elevated in CKD and correlate with brachial artery
flow-mediated dilation and with albuminuria, two indicators of endothelial dysfunction. Thus, increased levels of
FD (as observed with reduced GFR in CKD) links CKD with systemic AP dysregulation, which may be an
important mechanism of CVD and CKD progression in patients with CKD. Genetic variants in complement
regulatory genes may also affect AP activation and may contribute to the risk of CVD and CKD progression in
patients with CKD. Our group has identified several common CFH gene polymorphisms that associate with
functional AP activation. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that CKD patients develop an acquired imbalance
between FD and FH (high FD/FH ratio) leading to AP dysregulation (i.e., activation) such that biomarkers of the
AP are predictive of CVD, CKD progression, and death in CKD. Secondarily, we hypothesize that individuals
with a genetic propensity towards AP dysregulation will be the most susceptible to AP dysregulation in the setting
of CKD. To test our hypothesis, we propose to utilize samples from two clinical trials: Veterans Affairs
Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) and the Systolic Blood Pressure Interventional Trial (SPRINT). In
aim 1, if CKD is independently associated with AP activation and determine if high FD/FH ratio predicts AP
activation in CKD. In aims 2a and 2b we will examine whether plasma Ba independently predicts CVD or CKD
progression in CKD patients, respectively. In aim 3, we will determine if CKD subjects with the highest degree of
AP activation are enriched for genetic variants in CFH and other genes of the AP vs those with the lowest degree
of AP activation. The proposed experiments will help us understand the mechanisms that underlie AP
dysregulation in CKD and may define new therapeutic targets in this high-risk patient population."
10814850,"Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of cancer, including more than 130,000 people each year in
the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype (82% of all lung cancers)
and can arise from squamous or non-squamous lung epithelial cells. Combination treatment with immunotherapy
(i.e., monoclonal antibodies targeted to PD-1 or PD-L1) plus concurrent chemotherapy (usually including cisplatin
or carboplatin) is now part of the standard of care for many patients with NSCLC. Although in lab-based studies,
chemotherapy has some effects that are expected to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, whether
chemotherapy can also have paradoxical negative effects that diminish immunotherapy efficacy is not well
understood at present. Based on our preliminary data, we propose to investigate how cisplatin, a chemotherapy
commonly used to treat NSCLC, creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits the
anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Specifically, we hypothesize the following steps: (a) cisplatin
induces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in tumor cells; (b) PGE2 leads to upregulation of CD73 enzyme on
the surface of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs); (c) CD73 catalyzes the production of
extracellular adenosine from AMP (derived from ATP released from dying cells); and (d) adenosine inhibits the
activation of effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and thus limits the efficacy of chemo-
immunotherapy. Furthermore, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming this adenosine-mediated
immunosuppression and sensitizing tumors to chemo-immunotherapy, whereby co-treatment with recombinant
polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase enzyme (PEG-ADA) will convert immunosuppressive
adenosine into immunostimulatory inosine. In Specific Aim 1 of this project, we will test our predictions about the
key cellular and molecular players in this pathway, including cisplatin-induced PGE2 secretion, CD73 expression
on M-MDSC, adenosine production and suppression of anti-tumoral T cell activity. We will use a variety of in vivo
systems that provide a faithful representation of human NSCLC, including an orthotopic murine lung cancer
model and humanized mice with patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In Specific Aim 2, we will test the
effectiveness of selectively deleting CD73 in M-MDSCs or co-treating with PEG-ADA as approaches to increase
the anti-tumor/immunostimulatory activities of chemo-immunotherapy (anti-PD-1 + cisplatin) in transgenic mouse
models of non-squamous and squamous NSCLC. We will also examine tumor samples from NSCLC patients
who have progressed on anti-PD-1/chemotherapy for correlative evidence of this novel mechanism. Completion
of these aims will identify novel and actionable immunosuppressive mechanisms that mediate relapse and
therapeutic resistance in metastatic NSCLC patients. Our studies will establish adding PEG-ADA (a drug that is
FDA-approved for a non-cancer indication) to standard chemo-immunotherapy as a promising strategy that can
be quickly translated into improved NSCLC treatment regimens."
10887385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overdoses deaths have increased sharply in Canada and the US since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While fentanyl is a critical driver of North America’s overdose epidemic, rising fentanyl-stimulant polysubstance
use and ongoing drug supply changes (fluctuating fentanyl potency, adulteration of fentanyl with novel
psychoactive substances) are worsening the situation and pose challenges to overdose prevention and addiction
treatment approaches. There has been a lack of research into these emerging dynamics and how they intersect
with social, structural, and environmental influences to shape overdose vulnerability and the effectiveness of the
overdose response. Based in Vancouver, Canada, this study will employ an innovative ethno-epidemiological
approach to address this critical research gap by: (1) characterizing how evolving drug use patterns and supply
changes impact overdose vulnerability; (2) examining how changing drug use patterns and drug supply changes
intersect with social, structural, and environmental influences to impact the effectiveness of overdose prevention
interventions; and (3) exploring social, structural, and environmental influences on treatment outcomes for
existing and emerging opioid agonist treatment (OAT) approaches among fentanyl-stimulant polysubstance-
using and NPS exposed PWUD. Vancouver is the ideal setting to undertake the proposed research. Vancouver
had implemented innovative overdose prevention and addiction treatment interventions that led to significant
decreases in overdose deaths and that were later implemented – or are now being considered – elsewhere in
the US and internationally, including drug checking programs, supervised consumption sites, and low-threshold
oral and injectable OAT. This comprehensive overdose response is being adapted in response to rising overdose
deaths attributed to fentanyl-stimulant polysubstance use and drug supply changes, including by expanding
drug-checking approaches (benzodiazepine testing strips), expanding OAT options (e.g., oral and injectable
OAT), implementing supervised inhalation services, and integrating OAT a contingency management and
detoxification services. This study will be nested within the research infrastructure of the BC Centre on Substance
Use, which includes three NIDA-funded, longitudinal cohort studies of PWUD and a NIDA-funded drug-checking
program evaluation. This approach will enable epidemiologically-informed sampling and targeted recruitment of
PWUD and facilitate the integration of qualitative data and cohort-based and drug surveillance data. Extending
our ethno-epidemiological research to examine how a comprehensive response to the overdose epidemic is
being adapted to rising fentanyl-stimulant polysubstance use and drug supply changes will result in a more
nuanced and complete understanding of influences on the effectiveness of the overdose response than is
possible through epidemiological research alone. The proposed research is aligned with NIH and NIDA strategic
priorities and will generate evidence critical to optimizing the response to the overdose epidemic."

Regulation of OXPHOS assembly in skeletal muscles
The skeletal musculature is by far the largest organ in animals, accounting for about half the body weight of
humans and up to 75% of the body mass of insects. In order to provide the energy required for contraction of
muscles, skeletal muscles tend to be highly enriched with mitochondria. Accordingly, mitochondrial disorders
frequently present with myopathy as a prominent clinical feature. While the factors responsible for increasing
overall mitochondrial mass during myogenesis have been well-characterized, relatively little is known about the
specific factors that assist with assembling the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in muscles. The
broad and long-term objective of my research group is to discover and elucidate the mechanism(s) by which
various proteins regulate OXPHOS assembly in skeletal muscles. Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) is a nuclear-
encoded oxidoreductase that is largely localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Mutations in AIF
cause major alterations in the OXPHOS system and is associated with muscle atrophy in humans. However, the
precise mechanism by which AIF exerts its bioenergetics functions has not been resolved. The rising number of
pathogenic AIF variants underscores the importance of AIF in human pathophysiology and has made seeking
therapeutic options difficult, as it is a major reason for the highly pleiotropic nature of AIF mutations. Therefore,
elucidating the mechanism by which AIF regulates OXPHOS assembly in muscles is significant, and is a crucial
unmet need, as it will allow the development of therapeutic strategies that exploit various functional properties
of AIF to treat specific pathological mutations of the protein in muscles. Accordingly, we have established a
genetically tractable system for studying AIF’s function in Drosophila flight muscles. Based on our findings
discussed elsewhere in this proposal, we have formulated the following central hypothesis to be tested: AIF is a
key signaling hub that regulates OXPHOS assembly through its effect on stabilizing the mitochondrial
intermembrane space bridging (MIB) supercomplex, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and interaction
with other proteins. We will test our hypothesis via three specific aims. First, we will dissect the mechanism by
which AIF regulates OXPHOS biogenesis via the MIB supercomplex (Aim 1) and elucidate how ROS signaling
impinges on the AIF bioenergetics phenotypes (Aim 2). Finally, we will define and functionally characterize the
AIF interactome (Aim 3). We will be using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), in-gel
OXPHOS activity assays, Western blots, RNA-seq, genetics, transmission electron microscopy, and a range of
physiology and cell biology assays to address these questions. Altogether, we envisage that the ease of isolating
copious amounts of mitochondria from Drosophila flight muscles, extensive arsenal of tools for genetic analyses,
relatively short generation time, and limited gene redundancy in Drosophila are assets that should make it
feasible to elucidate the mechanism by which AIF regulates OXPHOS assembly."
10836577,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prediabetes (PD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) affect 122 million Americans. Although diabetes is the most costly
chronic condition in the US—with an annual economic burden of $327 billion—it is severely underdiagnosed,
with 84% of those with PD and 21% of those with T2D unaware of their condition. Screening guidelines for PD
and T2D include coarse self-reports with low positive predictive value, and therefore have been unable to
mitigate this severe diagnostic gap. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop and implement an innovative,
practical, and scalable PD and T2D detection strategy by leveraging digital data obtained using personal
consumer smart devices (smartphones and smartwatches). Smartphones and smartwatches are now prevalent
in the general population, and the technology developed here will be directly translatable for immediate
deployment to improve the detection of PD and T2D. Toward this goal, we recently developed wearable-based
models using a research-grade wearable wristband to detect personalized glucose deviations, predict interstitial
glucose values, and estimate the level of glycated hemoglobin (A1c), which are all key metrics for detecting and
monitoring PD and T2D. The wearable-based models currently function on people with a limited A1c range
(prediabetic and elevated normal). To translate this work and expand the reach and yield of current screening
methods, we propose the following two Specific Aims: (1) Validate and extend the wearable models to
distinguish between T2D, PD, and normoglycemia; and (2) Determine how we can leverage smartphones and
smartwatches to improve the yield and reach of present screening methods for PD and T2D. In the first Aim, we
will validate and extend our preliminary work developing the wearable models to function across a wider range
of glycemic variability, interstitial glucose, and A1c values and to move from research-grade wearables to
consumer-grade smartwatches. In the second Aim, we will expand the reach of current guideline-based
screening using text message delivery of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) “60-second Risk Test” to
directly assess and inform patients about their risk for PD and T2D with the goal of increasing A1c testing in
patients that meet the risk criteria. We will increase the yield of true positives by adding objective smartwatch
and/or smartphone measures (e.g., physical activity, sedentary habits, glycemic health parameter estimations)
to the existing ADA 60-second Risk Test model. The innovations from this proposed research could transform
PD and T2D detection for the 81 million Americans with undiagnosed PD and T2D through novel methods for
real-time, continuous mobile screening. Successful completion of this project could ultimately revolutionize
diabetes management by improving early detection and by enabling proactive intervention to prevent or reverse
T2D progression."

The long-term objective of our research is to understand the basic principles regulating the development and
regeneration of skin and its appendages, and to apply this knowledge to regenerative medicine. Recent
progress in stem cell biology has allowed the production of skin substitutes which help patients suffering from
severe skin injuries to survive. Yet, these skin substitutes lack regional specificities seen in human skin (e.g.,
scalp, face, palm, sole). The next major challenge will be to produce skins with proper region-specific
phenotypes for optimal function. While studies on region-specific skin in the mouse ear, sole and human
fibroblasts were carried out, no systemic studies have been made. Birds exhibit remarkable region-specific skin
appendages for communication, endothermy and flight, and are accessible to experimentation. We have
demonstrated how temporo-spatial expression of diffusible morphogens (Wnt, FGF, BMP and their
antagonists) can mediate epidermal-dermal interactions to generate distinct skin appendage phenotypes. Yet,
how these morphogens work at the epigenetic level, including upstream in the dermis and downstream in the
epidermis, are mostly unknown. Several recent studies provide new clues. First, the scalp is known to be a
unique skin domain with distinct appendage phenotypes in humans (terminal hairs or alopecia) and birds (crest
feathers or combs). Polish chicken variants grow feathers instead of the comb on the scalp. Using genetic
analyses, we showed a195 bp duplication in the non-coding region of HoxC10. This study offers new clues to
study how misexpression of HoxC members can act on morphogens to change combs into feathers, and how
the HoxC gene cluster is regulated. Second, using transcriptome analyses to compare dorsal and shank skin,
we recently identified a group of molecular scale-feather converters. Following this clue, we performed ATAC-
seq and high-order chromatin interactome studies to explore 3D genome organizations in feathers, scales, and
intermediate specimens. Preliminary data reveal differential chromatin accessible regions in feather / scale
inductive dermis, and in competent / committed epidermis, providing new insights into the induction of region-
specific skin appendages. Thus, the time is ripe to follow these clues to advance our understanding of skin
regional specification. We hypothesize that dermis in different skin regions exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles,
leading to specific combinatorial morphogen expressions, which guide epidermis to form specific appendage
types. In development, epidermal cells, during a time window, can exhibit bipotent competency to respond to
different dermal signals and form specific appendage types. The hypothesis will be evaluated and developed
further using a combination of classical tissue transplantation experiments and cutting-edge omics
technologies. We will focus on the scalp, dorsal and shank skins in this study but consider the fundamental
principles that would be applicable to other skin regions. The work will advance our understanding of how
region-specific skin appendages are established from the morphogen level to the epigenetic level."

Despite the number of adults within their child-bearing years diagnosed with, treated for, and surviving colorectal cancer (CRC), reproductive health concerns stand as an unmet care need among adults ages 18 to 49 years with CRC (early-onset CRC) and their families. This is because there is a paucity of prospective data to objectively measure the deleterious effects of CRC and its therapies on fertility and sexual health over time within this patient population. Given the unexplained, rising incidence of early-onset CRC over the last decades, the time is now for us to address these unmet fertility and sexual health care needs in order to improve outcomes within this growing population of reproductive age CRC survivors. Thus, this study is specifically designed to address a long-standing unmet need and achieve its overarching goal: to identify changes in gonadal function caused by CRC treatments and investigate psychosocial dimensions of sexual health and fertility-after a diagnosis of early-onset CRC. We will use validated PROM IS sexual function and satisfaction (SexFS), PROMIS-29 core health, lifestyle-related and reproductive health questionnaires, and qualitative interviews (Aim 1) to prospectively define the psychological dimensions of reproductive health at diagnosis, treatment and surveillance timepoints; as well as changes in these measures over time. This will inform the highest reproductive health concerns and needs specifically for early-onset CRC patients at uniform timepoints across the cancer care continuum. We will then use fasting blood samples (Aim 2) and detailed clinical and treatment data that are collected in parallel to prospectively quantify the impact of CRC therapies on gonadal function at three uniform study timepoints. Both specific aims utilize the same study population--the PREserving Fertility After Colorectal CancEr (PREFACE) Study cohort that is enrolling a total of 220 newly-diagnosed CRC patients between ages 18 and 49 years at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. All laboratory assays in Aim 2 will be conducted using FDA-approved clinical immunoassays for AMH, estradiol, FSH, SHBG, LH, DHEAS, inhibin B, testosterone, DHT, and androstenedione in a CUA-accredited and CDC-certified laboratory. Overall, this study is conceptually innovative in that our cohort pairs standardized, fasting blood collection with robust sexual health, fertility, reproductive history, menstrual patterns, sociodemographic, exposures, and quality of life data, and is 11-fold larger than previous fertility-related studies in early-onset CRC. This project will generate crucial new data from a unique cohort and is statistically powered to drive significant advances toward concordant reproductive health care assessment and physical/psychosocial support strategies specific to CRC patients of reproductive age. Our findings will lead to incorporating reproductive health care in the clinical management of early-onset CRC, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes specifically for this patient population."
10893359,"Abstract
The retina and visual cortex represents visual information in the form of a complex set of electrical
signals to support visual behavior and memory. Although we have learned a great deal about how
simple visual patterns such as striped gratings lead to neural activity in the early visual system, we
know little about how natural visual scenes are represented during behavior, and how the active
process of gathering visual information through body and eye movements influences this process.
Visual processing becomes progressively more complex towards higher levels in the brain. Compared
to primates, mice combine strong motor input with visual input at an earlier level in the visual stream,
the primary visual cortex. This makes the mouse visual system an accessible to system to understand
how natural scenes are represented and influenced by active sensation at a level in the visual system
where computational models of the neural code for natural scenes are more tractable. This proposal
has two primary goals. First to determine how the neural code changes for natural scenes from the
retina to the cortex with an accurate computational model that can be analyzed to determine how
specific retinal cell types contribute to cortical activity for ethological computations such as determining
motion direction and speed, adaptation and object motion detection. Second, to test alternative
theoretically grounded hypotheses as to how motor activity influences the representation of natural
scenes, including the subtraction of expected visual stimuli to create a more efficient representation,
known as predictive coding, predictive or Bayesian feature detection that adjusts the detection
threshold to the prior probability that visual features are present, and simple adaptation to the strength
of combined signals to avoid saturation. Using high channel count silicon probes, computational models
that combine known biophysical and circuit level properties with interpretable cutting edge machine
learning approaches and virtual reality systems, we will gain new insight into visual processing for
natural scenes in the early visual system. These results will give a quantitative picture of how the retina
and visual cortex function, which will be essential in understand how diseases that affect central visual
processing such as amblyopia, strabismus and schizophrenia, and reveal general principles of cortical
sensory processing. The computational models established here will also be directly applicable for use
in retinal and cortical visual prosthesis systems."

Cone beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) with a digital flat panel detector (FPD) is the primary imaging
workhorse for image-guided interventions. By rotating the tube-detector assembly around the patient, 3D cone
beam CT (CBCT) data can be acquired to supplement 2D x-ray imaging and improve disease diagnosis,
treatment planning, and treatment execution in medical procedures. Despite its volumetric coverage and high
spatial resolution, FPD-based CBCT does not provide the necessary soft-tissue contrast resolution for
intraoperative hemorrhage monitoring, gray-white matter differentiation, or the detection of other low-contrast
lesions in a variety of imaging tasks. In addition, quantitative imaging capabilities that are much desired by
physicians are lacking in the current CBCT technology. The overarching objective of this project is to
develop an integrated PCD-FPD CBCT imaging platform by adding an x-ray photon counting detector
(PCD) to the current CBCT system, enabling users to freelyswitch between the new PCD-CBCT imaging
mode and the existing FPD-based imaging without interference between the two components. This new
imaging platform offers the same soft-tissue contrast resolution and z-coverage as those of MDCT, but
without requiring additional room space to house both MDCT and CBCT in the same suite. Additionally,
the proposed system offers quantitative spectral CT imaging functionality at reduced radiation and contrast dose
for image-guided interventions. To develop the integrated PCD-FPD CBCT imaging system and to explore its
added value to medical diagnosis, three specific aims are planned. Aim #1 is designed to construct and calibrate
a prototype PCD-CBCT system; Aim #2 is dedicated to the development of the novel correction algorithms
needed to achieve artifact-free PCD-CBCT images; Aim #3 is dedicated to clinical feasibility studies using in vivo
canine subjects and human subjects. Upon the completion of these aims, a prototype for the next-generation
CBCT imaging system will have been constructed, calibrated, and evaluated; the system will be capable of
consistently producing nearly artifact-free PCD-CBCT images with spectral imaging functionality and MDCT-like
low-contrast detectability; the benefits and potential clinical applications of the integrated PCD-FPD CBCT
imaging system will have been demonstrated."
10781999,"Summary. In this project, we will exploit mechanical properties of self-assembled DNA nanostructures to
modulate cell migrations. Cell migration represents a fundamental process in biological functions of almost all
multicellular organisms. Numerous diseases occur if cell migrations are not adequately regulated. We will
modulate the cell migration by mechanically interfering with lateral clustering or declustering of transmembrane
integrin receptors, which is a mechano-transduction process following the binding of the ligand (e.g. RGD) to
the integrin and characterized by the association of the integrin to the actin fibers important for cell motions.
 We will fabricate DNA origami nanoassemblies, DNA nanosprings, for this modulation. By placing discrete
piers in an extended template of DNA helix bundles, the DNA origami template will bend into coils of a
nanospring when adjacent piers are brought together by compact DNA linkers formed between piers. We plan
to use these DNA nanosprings as nanometer force gauges to monitor both compressive and tensile lateral
forces for the clustering and declustering of integrin receptors, respectively, on cell membranes. To serve as
force gauges, we will first determine the spring constant of nanosprings in optical tweezers. We will then
evaluate the extension change of the nanospring under external force using FRET dye pairs. By multiplication
of these two variables according to the Hooke’s law, we will reveal the force experienced by the nanospring.
 To modulate cell migration, we will adjust the spacing of RGD molecules anchored on DNA nanosprings by
coiling and uncoiling of nanosprings under environmental cues. Since RGD can bind to the integrin on a cell
membrane, the spacing of RGD on nanosprings allows to cluster/de-cluster integrin receptors. In the first
approach, we will use DNA i-motif as a chemo(pH)-responsive linker in the DNA nanospring. Slight acidity folds
i-motif in the linker, which coils the nanospring and shortens spacing of RGD to cluster integrins. Such a
nanospring will therefore inhibit migrations of cancer cells in slightly acidic extracellular matrix. At or above pH7,
nanosprings are coiled after duplex DNA is formed in the linker region. When complementary oligonucleotides
are applied to remove one of the duplex strands in the linker, the nanospring is uncoiled, which elongates RGD
spacing. This will promote migrations of cells such as human macrophages that play important roles to heal
skin wounds. The skin surface also permits the use of the light without deep penetration on topically applied
nanosprings. For this opto-mechanical modulation, we will incorporate light-sensitive azobenzene groups in the
linkers of DNA nanosprings. Using the light with different wavelengths, the azobenzene undergoes cis/trans
isomerization. This varies DNA linker length between neighboring piers, changing RGD spacing via coiling or
uncoiling the DNA nanospring. We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this strategy in the cell
spread and migration assays. In the proposal, we will use these assays to test the effects of nanosprings with
different mechanical properties (Aim 1) on migrations of HeLa cells (Aim 2) and human macrophages (Aim 3)."
10816555,"Short peptide-encoding sequences in the 5' untranslated region of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA),
called upstream open reading frames (uORFs), are widespread in ~50% of human mRNAs. Translating
these uORF sequences reduces the protein output of an mRNA main open reading frame (mORF). Our
bioinformatic analysis of human and mouse ribosome profiling databases uncovered a group of cardiac
mRNA transcripts containing translated uORFs, such as transcription factors, including GATA4.
Biochemical analysis suggests that stabilizing the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure downstream of
the start codons of these peptide-encoding sequences enhances their translation, thereby inhibiting the
translation of mORFs. This translational inhibitory mechanism is mitigated by DEAD-box RNA helicase
DDX3X that unwinds dsRNA and inactivates uORF. Genetic depletion of GATA4 uORF activity using
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genomic editing of the start codon in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) provides
evidence of uORF-mediated regulation of mORF translation and cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy. In
addition, an established CRISPR-Cas9-derived uORF start codon mutant knock-in mouse model shows
spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy and will be used to characterize CM hypertrophy at baseline and under
stress conditions. Based on our discovered molecular mechanism of DDX3X-regulated, dsRNA-dependent,
uORF-mediated translational inhibition of mORF, we have developed two types of antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) that can either enhance or reduce uORF translation by strengthening or disrupting
dsRNA structures. The uORF-enhancing ASO locks the dsRNA structure and activates translation of the
uORF, thereby reducing GATA4 mORF protein expression in human CMs. Treatment of mouse
cardiomyopathy models with uORF-enhancing ASO reduces GATA4 protein expression, antagonizes
cardiac hypertrophy, and restores cardiac function. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that cardiac
transcription factor mRNA uORF-dsRNA element acts as a switch for translational control of mORF,
regulating cardiac hypertrophy, and can be targeted by ASOs to modulate mORF protein translation and
cardiac hypertrophy. We will focus on 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1. Elucidate mRNA structural elements and
their interplay with the GATA4 uORF for regulating mORF translation. Aim 2. Determine the biological role
of the GATA4 uORF in genetic knock-in mouse models and primary CM cell culture systems. Aim 3.
Develop proof-of-concept translation-manipulating ASOs targeting the GATA4 uORF for short-term anti-
hypertrophy intervention. These studies will provide novel insights into translational control mechanisms
in cardiac biology. This project will promote novel therapeutic approaches (targeting uORF-dsRNA
elements) to regulate cardiac hypertrophy. Our mechanism-based design of translation-manipulating
ASOs can serve as a proof-of-concept model to apply to different pathogenic mRNA targets."
10824277,"This study proposes longitudinal research among older adults to assess the associations of uncontrolled pain,
co-occurring chronic conditions or geriatric symptoms (multimorbidity), and opioid–drug interactions with risk
for opioid use disorder (OUD) or overdose (OD). This study is responsive to AHRQ’s special interest (NOT-HS-
21-010) in research to address substance use disorders, including OUD and OD in older adults. Older adults
have experienced significant increases in OUD or OD in the last decade despite a decrease in the number of
opioid prescriptions, signaling an urgent need to identify factors beyond prescription opioid use that contribute
to OUD/OD to inform interventions in older populations. Pain, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, all strongly
associated with advancing age, are frequently noted as potential risk factors for OUD/OD in older adults, but
relevant evidence is lacking. Relieving pain is the most frequent motive for opioid misuse in older adults, but to
what extent uncontrolled pain contributes to risk for OUD/OD is unknown. Multimorbidity is highly prevalent in
older adults with OUD or OD, but its association with uncontrolled pain and the joint association of
multimorbidity and uncontrolled pain with risk for OUD/OD are unknown. There is also limited understanding
regarding the risk of OUD/OD when prescription opioids for pain treatment are concurrently used with drugs for
other chronic comorbid conditions that may interact with opioids in older adults. To fill these research gaps, this
proposed study will leverage a 100% Medicare sample and Medicare data linked to nationally representative
longitudinal survey data to study the associations of pain, multimorbidity, and opioid-drug interactions with risk
for OUD/OD outcomes of older adults with chronic pain. Specifically, we will examine the associations
between pain control and risk for OUD or OD in older adults diagnosed with chronic pain and treated with
prescription opioids. We will also evaluate the association of multimorbidity with pain control and their joint
association with OUD/OD risk in older patients. Furthermore, we will assess the extent to which concurrent use
of opioids with drugs for treating common comorbid conditions with chronic pain in older adults is associated
with OUD/OD outcomes in older adults with chronic pain. We will measure both pain and high-impact pain and
quantify multimorbidity through both a diagnosis-based index and the presence of geriatric symptoms that are
underdiagnosed or not diagnosable. Our study will provide empirical evidence on the extent to which
uncontrolled pain, multimorbidity, and opioid-drug interactions may play a role in increasing risk for OUD or OD
among older adults with chronic pain. Given the accelerated growth of the US aging population and the
continuing increase in OUD, OD, and opioid misuse, our data will inform interventions that integrate care for
chronic pain and other chronic comorbid conditions to improve pain control while reducing OUD or OD in older
adults."
10794373,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms with dismal prognosis, frequent progression
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and no effective treatment. A decade ago, a development with transformative
potential for this disease was the discovery that more than half of MDS patients have somatic mutations in
genes encoding splicing factors (SFs, i.e. RNA binding proteins that regulate pre-mRNA splicing). While the
high frequency and early occurrence during the disease course of SF mutations rendered them promising
targets, efforts to therapeutically leverage this through splicing modulator drugs did not show promise in clinical
testing and the drug development pipeline for these targets, and for MDS in general, is currently nearly empty.
 We developed genetically faithful human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of SF-mutated
MDS using CRISPR gene editing and performed integrative analyses of splicing (RNA-Seq) and RNA binding
(eCLIP) to search for mis-spliced transcripts that are direct common targets of two of the main SF mutations
(SRSF2 P95L and the U2AF1 S34F). We found that both mutant SRSF2 and mutant U2AF1 cause altered
splicing of the gene GNAS, promoting the production of a longer isoform (GNAS-L), which in turn produces a
longer form of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, G⍺s (G⍺s-L). G proteins are key signaling
molecules involved in many important signaling pathways and cell functions, including oncogenic processes.
Our preliminary data using functional, biochemical and population genetics approaches support a critical role
for the long form of G⍺s (G⍺s-L) as an MDS driver and reveal a new mechanism by which SF mutations drive
MDS that opens a completely novel and unexplored therapeutic avenue for MDS, AML and other cancers with
SF gene mutations.
 The goal of this proposal is to investigate G⍺s as a therapeutic target for MDS and identify
opportunities for therapeutic interventions that inhibit signaling by G⍺s-L. Specifically, we propose to: (1)
Evaluate the effects of direct degradation (through a dTAG) or inhibition (by novel cyclic peptides) of G⍺s in
splicing factor (SF)-mutated MDS and AML hematopoietic cells (primary and iPSC-derived) using recently
developed iPSC-based models of MDS-to-sAML progression and longitudinal bone marrow samples from MDS
patients who progressed to AML; (2) Characterize and target cell signaling downstream of Gs-L through
candidate and unbiased approaches (Reverse Phase Protein Array, CyTOF, transcriptomics); and (3) Identify
the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in Gs-L activation in SF-mutated MDS and AML through
focused CRISPR KO screens.
 This study can establish a novel therapeutic target that may transform the treatment of MDS, AML and
possibly other cancers."
10843290,"Metastasis remains the primary cause of death in women with breast cancer. While it is well established
that tumor cells are heterogeneous and minority populations within the tumor have tumor-initiating and metastatic
capabilities, the identity of metastasis initiating cells (MICs) in human breast cancer remains controversial. Until
we can identify these cells and study the molecular pathways regulating them, the development of new
therapeutic strategies will be hindered. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the intrinsic and
extrinsic molecular signaling regulating MICs. Recently, using single-cell RNA sequencing data from breast
cancer patient samples and sophisticated computational approaches we identified an immature population of
cells in breast cancer that express hematopoietic stem cell transcriptional adaptor and the T-cell oncogene,
LMO2. The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanism of LMO2 in promoting metastasis.
We hypothesize that LMO2+ cells are a population of MICs in breast cancer that are activated in response to
inflammation and LMO2 is a key adaptor that regulates this process. Our hypothesis is based on our preliminary
results that demonstrate that Lmo2+ cells are metastatic, predict poor distant recurrence-free survival in patients,
LMO2 knockdown reduces metastasis in multiple human tumor models, and LMO2 is required for STAT3
activation in response to IL6 and TNFα. The rationale underlying this proposal is that αidentifying the signaling of
LMO2 in metastasis will elucidate targets in MICs that are open to therapeutic intervention. Guided by strong
preliminary data, our proposal will 1. Determine whether LMO2 is required for inflammation-induced metastasis.
2. Determine the detailed molecular signaling regulated by LMO2-STAT3 axis. 3. Determine whether LMO2+
cells utilize vascular mimicry to metastasize. The proposed research is significant because it will enable the
design of therapeutic strategies targeting MICs in breast cancer. Previous research studies on the identification
of MICs have relied on established lineage markers. The proposed research is innovative because we are
focusing on a population of LMO2+ MICs that were agnostically identified from single-cell RNA sequencing in
breast cancer patient samples. The proposed research will substantially enhance our understanding of MICs
and lay the foundation for novel strategies to treat metastatic breast cancer."
10830415,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy has led to impressive advances in the treatment of melanoma; yet, its clinical outcomes remain
limited by various pathophysiological factors, such as the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and the
key molecular determinants of antitumor immunity remain elusive. Discovering novel and effective
immunomodulatory targets and the mechanisms involved would lead to innovative strategies for enhancing the
effectiveness of current cancer immunotherapy. Such discoveries are urgently needed. Previous work from this
research team showed that attenuated Brucella melitensis mutants (i.e., BmΔvjbR) substantially improved the
suppressive TME, and the use of BmΔvjbR significantly enhanced adoptive cell transfer (ACT)-based
immunotherapy. Intriguingly, treatment with BmΔvjbR resulted in the accumulation of this safe, attenuated
mutant in tumor tissues, polarized M1 macrophages (Mφ), and promoted T cell activation and the production of
proinflammatory cytokines; moreover, combining BmΔvjbR treatment with an ACT of tumor antigen (Ag)-specific
T cells significantly enhanced the accumulation of M1 Mφ and T cell persistence in tumor tissues. In addition,
metabolite signals from the microbiota instruct T cell fate and function; tryptophan (Trp) metabolites (e.g.,
hydroxyindoles, HI) promote T cell activity. Recent preliminary studies show that compared with BmΔvjbR, a
BmΔvjbR-HI strain that produces HI dramatically improved production of tumor-killing cytokines (e.g., TNFa,
IFNg and Granzyme B), accumulated in melanoma tissues, and suppressed tumor growth. It also dramatically
improved animal survival. Based on these exciting preliminary data, this research team hypothesizes that
engineered BmΔvjbR-HI will greatly improve the TME, and that targeting BmΔvjbR-HI can enhance the efficacy
of immunotherapy for melanoma. The overall goals of this multiple-PI project are to understand the role and
mechanism of BmΔvjbR-HI in modulating TME and immunotherapy resistance, and to establish this microbe as
a novel immunomodulatory target. This project will pursue the following three highly related and interactive
specific aims: (1) Determine the role and mechanism of BmΔvjbR-HI in modulating innate immunity; (2)
Determine the role and mechanism of BmΔvjbR-HI in regulating adaptive immunity; and (3) Identify the impact
of BmΔvjbR-HI on melanoma immunotherapy. This proposal combines the strength of cancer immunology in
the Song laboratory with the expertise of microbial pathogenesis in the de Figueiredo laboratory and the
knowledge of vaccine discovery in the Ficht laboratory. The research team has already established a humanized
mouse (NOD-scid IL2rgnull) tumor model in the laboratory as well as murine syngeneic systems for the proposed
studies. Therefore, they are poised to accomplish the above aims. Successful completion of this project would
not only reveal engineered BmΔvjbR-HI as a novel immunomodulatory agent to improve TME and elucidate its
mechanism of action, but also, provide new therapeutic strategies to significantly enhance current cancer
immunotherapy."
10832084,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is one of the most effective, well-tolerated, and cost-effective
treatments. The success of SBRT relies heavily on the precision of dose delivery, due to the typically small tumor
size, the very high radiation dose per fraction, and the sharp dose fall-off outside the target. For those sites
where the tumor moves due to respiration, motion management is indispensable to ensure the high-precision
dose delivery of SBRT. Current motion management strategies are either treating a large area encompassing
the tumor motion range, or only delivering radiation dose within a small window (e.g., a gating window or at the
end of inhale) of tumor motion cycle via indirect and inferior tumor motion monitoring (such as external surrogates
or implanted fiducial markers). In-treatment real-time volumetric imaging is highly desired to enable direct,
accurate, and markerless 3D tumor tracking for better motion management and capture unexpected large tumor
motion for patient safety. The availability and accuracy of in-treatment real-time patient 3D anatomy information
is also essential to the development of more active and advanced motion management technologies, such as
multileaf collimator tracking and 4D treatment delivery. The unpredictable motion change during treatment can
lead to substantial deviation of the delivered dose from the planned dose. Adaptive radiotherapy can compensate
for the dosimetric errors by adapting the subsequent fractions. However, due to the notable changes of
respiration, the pre-treatment imaging cannot provide the patient’s actual in-treatment anatomy to assess the
actual delivered dose for adaptive radiotherapy. In-treatment real-time volumetric imaging is needed to enable
dose-guided adaptive SBRT. Despite these strong needs, real-time volumetric imaging is not currently available
due to the big challenge of reconstructing an instantaneous 3D image from very few 2D projections to meet the
real-time requirement. To fill this clinical gap, we plan to develop a real-time volumetric imaging-based tumor
tracking and dose verification (RITD) system using novel techniques in deep learning, imaging, Monte Carlo
simulation and high-performance computation, and use lung SBRT treatment as a testbed. We will accomplish
the following specific aims: 1) To develop and refine a real-time on-board volumetric imaging and tumor tracking
method; 2) To develop an image correction method and a tumor/multi-organ segmentation method on the
volumetric images; 3) To evaluate the performance of the proposed RITD system and assess its clinical benefit.
The innovation of this study lies in developing new deep-learning approaches to enable real-time on-board
volumetric imaging and build accurate tumor tracking and dose verification capability into cancer radiotherapy.
It has substantial potential to improve lung SBRT treatment outcomes by reducing targeting uncertainty,
improving treatment accuracy and precision, and enabling dose-guided adaptive lung SBRT. It paves the way
for more active and advanced motion management (e.g., truly 4D radiotherapy). The proposed RITD system
may be adapted for other cancer sites; thus, it has far-reaching clinical potential."

Tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) often progress to dysfunction defined as T cell exhaustion.
Marked by expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the exhausted T (Tex) cell lineage is a
developmental continuum wherein PD-1low Tex progenitors give rise to terminally dysfunctional PD-1high Tex
cells. Notably, the immune checkpoint blockade therapy revives Tex progenitors, but not terminal Tex cells,
calling for exploration of their differentiation mechanisms and means of therapeutic intervention. In a murine
cancer model, tumor development induces differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in
association with generation of Tex cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TAMs exhibit shared
characteristics with type 1 dendritic cells (DC1s) including expression of the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor-8 (IRF8). IRF8 promotes TAM presentation of cancer cell antigens to CD8+ T cells similar to
DC1, but TAMs differ from DC1s in promoting high PD-1 expression. Importantly, macrophage-specific deletion
of IRF8 attenuates Tex cell differentiation, and suppresses tumor growth. Furthermore, human TAMs express
IRF8, and a TAM IRF8 gene signature tracks with a Tex cell gene signature in multiple cancer types. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that terminal Tex cell differentiation is driven by IRF8-expressing TAMs with a
tolerogenic antigen-presenting cell (APC) function in the tumor tissue, and such a TAM-Tex cell regulation axis
can be targeted for novel cancer immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine how IRF8 is
induced in TAMs, and how it promotes TAM APC function. By performing chromatin profiling experiments and
using genetic mouse models, we will assess whether the TAM-enriched transcription factor Batf2 enables IRF8
autoactivation via the +32kb Irf8 enhancer element. IRF8-deficient TAMs are defective in acquiring cancer cell
antigens. Using mouse strains with macrophage- or cancer cell-specific deletion of the B2m gene, we will
investigate whether IRF8 promotes TAM acquisition of antigens through cross-presentation or cross-dressing.
Secondly, we will define how the tolerogenic function of TAMs is specified, and how it can be reprogrammed
for therapy. Compared to DC1s, TAMs express lower levels of interleukin-15 (IL-15), but exhibit heightened
transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) signaling. By generating macrophage-specific gain- or loss-of-function
mouse models, we will explore whether blockage of TGF-b signaling reverses the tolerogenic APC function of
TAMs in an IL-15-dependent manner, and whether overexpression of IL-15 in macrophages is sufficient to
induce T cell-stimulatory TAMs in genetic models and in a cell therapy setting. Compared to DC1s, TAMs have
a smaller cell size. We will investigate whether and how activation of the metabolic regulator mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) reprogram TAMs to be immunostimulatory APCs. Successful completion
of this project will not only generate mechanistic insights into APC control of Tex cell differentiation in cancer,
but also guide the targeting of the TAM-Tex cell regulation axis for therapy of a wide range of malignancies."
10778633,"Clinical analyses show that UBR5 gene amplifications and overexpression occur in 10-40% cases
of many major types of aggressive human cancers. Furthermore, breast, ovarian and prostate
cancer patients carrying genetic alterations in UBR5 have significantly reduced survivals
compared to those without the lesions. Our experimental work in vitro and in vivo has first
demonstrated that UBR5, functioning like an “oncogene”, plays a profound role in promoting
breast and ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. We have also shown that tumor-derived UBR5
drives malignant triple negative mammary tumor growth through both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic
mechanisms, whereas it facilitates metastasis primarily in a tumor cell-autonomous manner.
Thus, further elucidating UBR5’s fundamental biology and identifying critical signaling nodules
controlled by UBR5 in its potent tumorigenic and immunoregulatory activities will not only advance
the science but also help the development of novel therapies for highly malignant breast cancer
that evades the endogenous cellular control mechanisms and resist current interventional
strategies.
We hypothesize that UBR5 promotes aggressive BC/TNBC via distinct mechanisms that include
controlling the CDC73 protein turnover in an E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner and
enhancing Interferon-g-induced transcription of the PDL1 gene and others in an E3 ligase-
independent manner. We propose to broaden and expand the exploration of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of these modulations in two major specific aims.
 (1) To characterize the biochemical basis of CDC73 protein regulation by UBR5 acting as an
E3 ubiquitin ligase; and investigate the role of the chemokine CXCL16 in mediating CDC73’s
immunostimulatory activities via recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor site.
 (2) To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism whereby UBR5 broadly enhances
the IFN--activated signaling pathway independently of the E3 ligase activity and explore the
therapeutic potential of pharmacological UBR5 inhibition.
The outcome of these studies will pave the way for developing innovative therapeutic strategies
for highly aggressive and therapy-resistant breast cancer by targeting UBR5 and/or its crucial
signaling pathways."
10804675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Resistance to anti-cancer therapies largely explains the abysmal 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced
colon cancer. Traditional chemotherapy regimens have been designed to efficiently stop proliferation and initiate
apoptosis in cancer cells, but have failed to appreciate the pro-chemoresistance signals emanating from cells
surrounding the tumor. We have identified a novel cellular component of the tumor microenvironment: the enteric
glial cells (EGC). We and others have shown over the last 15 years that EGC are potent inducers of barrier
function and healing in a healthy colon. Recently we have demonstrated that the EGC network substantially
infiltrates human colon adenocarcinomas and promotes cancer stem cell tumor-forming abilities via a paracrine
PGE2-EP4 pathway. Nevertheless, whether EGC impact colon cancer resistance to chemotherapy remains
unknown. Our preliminary studies indicate that EGC protect cancer stem cells against apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic drugs, allowing for enhanced tumor formation and growth despite the chemotherapy
treatment. We also have evidence that this is (1) dependent on activation of the MRN-ATM pathway - a central
player in DNA repair- in cancer cells and (2) exacerbated by EGC activation with chemotherapy. Using mass
spectrometry analyses, we have identified FSTL3 as a novel EGC-derived factor and generated preliminary
results implicating FSTL3 in EGC chemoprotective effects. Therefore, we propose to test the hypothesis that “in
response to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGC release larger amounts of FSTL3 in the tumor microenvironment,
which enhances cancer stem cell chemoresistance and allows for tumor formation and growth by promoting DNA
repair driven by the MRN-ATM pathway”. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether EGC promote cancer stem cell
resistance to chemotherapies via the release of FSTL3. Specific Aim 2 will test whether EGC protective effects
are mediated by increased DNA repair as a result of activation of the MRN-ATM pathway. Specific Aim 3 will
determine whether blocking FSTL3 production in EGC sensitizes colon tumors to chemotherapies in vivo.
Studies will use translationally relevant primary cultures of human EGC and cancer cells, 3D co-culture platforms,
orthotopic co-engraftment in immunodeficient mice, murine models of colon carcinogenesis, transgenic mice
allowing for chemogenetic activation of EGC (GFAP-hM3Dq) and inducible gene targeting in EGC (GFAP-
CreERT2), in addition to cutting-edge molecular profiling using single cell RNA seq and mass spectrometry
studies to identify the pro-chemoresistance factor(s) (and in particular FSTL3) and pathway(s) involved. These
studies will not only improve our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving colon cancer
chemoresistance but will also demonstrate the therapeutic potential of developing strategies combining targeted
therapies against EGC-derived FSTL3 and traditional chemotherapy regimens."

In the prior work we have extended our multimodal magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) approaches and have shown that it is possible to model, or predict, the latency of the auditory
evoked neuromagnetic field component, the M50, occurring approximately 50-100ms post stimulus in children,
but delayed in ASD, and measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG), by using diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify the microstructure of the auditory pathway white matter (in particular the
thalamocortical acoustic radiations). While this approach accounted for more than 50% of the variance in
typically developing controls, it was confounded by heterogeneity in a cohort of ~100children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). However, this actually allowed identification of a sub-population of children with ASD
whose M50 responses appeared as “outliers” to the TD model (i.e. “unpredictably long M50’s); interestingly,
these children showed significantly lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) estimated by advance
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) than their ASD peers whose latencies were consistent with the TD
model. Identification of this group has significant implications for treatment/intervention by identifying a
biological basis for stratification (sub-population definition) and thus a putative biological target for intervention
(as well as a means of defining an inclusion criterion for selecting that therapy). The present proposal extends
this work to the scientifically and societally critical group of children with ASD with severe language and
cognitive impairments, who are under-included in imaging research, but whose vital participation is made
possible by a combined behavioral and technical protocol we have recently developed, called MEG-PLAN, and
its MRI analog: MRI-PLAN. To ascertain the clinical and behavioral implications of delayed M50 brain
responses, we also recruit children with mixed etiology intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), but not
autism, and seek to identify the relative associations of language impairment, cognitive impairment and ASD
diagnosis to the M50 latency delay and to investigate the biophysical underpinnings of these association with
multimodal MEG, MRI and MRS. We also extend beyond examination of auditory response timing to probes of
auditory and language neuronal circuitry via. oscillatory responses also detected by MEG and examine their
relation to GABA levels as well as to clinical language assessment. Taken together, this proposal focuses on
several levels of stratification to combat the formidable heterogeneity observed in ASD and, critically, employs
state of the art multimodal methodologies, made feasible by the MEG-PLAN and MRI-PLAN protocols, in
severely-impaired children with ASD (conventionally not included in such research) to assess generalization of
observations across the broad autism spectrum."

This application is to continue the successful NIOSH TPG at Virginia Tech. Our aims are to provide a high-
quality education to trainees, to train them in conducting effective basic and/or applied research, and to provide
service to our profession, to industry, and to society. A key goal of our program is to support the NIOSH goal
of supplying qualified professionals for careers that address occupational safety and health (OSH) through
both research and practice. Our program emphasizes three aspects of OSH at the MS (thesis) and PhD
levels: safety engineering, occupational ergonomics, and occupational biomechanics. This renewal
application seeks program support for five years, and is budgeted to support two full-time, pre-doctoral
trainees. We target a mix of trainees at the MS and PhD levels.
 The need for training in these areas is justified in several ways, primarily by the continuing levels of
occupational accidents, injuries, and illnesses; substantial program interest; educational needs in
contemporary OSH positions; and the national need for trained researchers and practitioners in these areas.
Our program is characterized by a dual emphasis on breadth of trainee experience and the requirement for
specialization. TPG funds allow us to maintain this emphasis, as well as attract and retain outstanding
trainees.
 A broad, yet cohesive group of faculty and staff support the program, and who are in multiple departments
and colleges at VT. Training is achieved through a combination of formal coursework, faculty advising,
research, and more general exposure through seminars and interdisciplinary interactions. Core sets of
courses exist at both the MS and PhD levels, and each trainee conducts a formal research project. Several
mechanisms will be used to evaluate and improve the program, including an external advisory committee and
trainee feedback, and a plan for diversity enhancement, enrollment, and retention that is aligned with the
University and Department Strategic Plans for Diversity.
 Candidates for our program are MS or PhD students accepted within the Industrial and Systems
Engineering Department. Prospective trainees are also actively recruited through several means. Our
program overall has been quite successful during the prior period, based on the number of graduates, the high
proportion of graduates continuing in the OSH field, faculty and student scholarly output and awards, and the
continuing high number of applications received."

Curricular and Instructional Enhancement of the M.S. in Risk Control and Safety Management Program
 PI/Program Director: Brian Finder, DIT, CIH
finderb@uwstout.edu
Program Characteristics and Grant Purpose
This reapplication is for a training program grant which will support the University of Wisconsin-Stout’s
M.S. Risk Control and Safety Management program. This graduate program was initiated in 1974 as a
M.S. Safety degree and was changed to M.S. Risk Control in 1990 to reflect the needs, expectations and
challenges of individuals who work the field of worker safety/health, property and environmental
protection. The program’s total asset protection perspective requires students to be competent beyond
simply understanding safety practices and regulatory compliance. The philosophy of risk control attempts
to elevate and integrate the technical areas of safety engineering, industrial hygiene and environmental
protection from lower operations issues to being upper management-level concerns. In 2020, the program
name was further modified to M.S. Risk Control and Safety Management to clarify its strong employee
protection focus. The program’s mission is to preserve tomorrow's workforce and their communities by
instilling risk control and safety management-based principles, knowledge, and skills into the students to
promote the protection of employee, property and environmental-based assets. The program has produced
559 graduates since its inception and recent annual enrollments range between 25 and 30 students. The
program offers traditional face-to-face on-campus weekday evening classes which are augmented with an
online instructional teleconferencing system to deliver live lectures to distance-based students.
The purpose of this grant is to enhance the curriculum and instruction of the Master of Science Degree in
Risk Control and Safety Management program at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. The specific focus
of the enhancement effort involves financial assistance in recruitment of qualified students, faculty
teaching flexibility and development, and instructional support.
Trainees
Individuals with undergraduate degrees in engineering, technology, chemistry, and biological sciences as
well as management and business backgrounds are recruited into the M.S. in Risk Control and Safety
Management program. A significant emphasis is placed on recruiting individuals from underrepresented
and underserved groups.
Training Facilities
The primary training facility is the University of Wisconsin-Stout campus consists of classrooms and
laboratories. Local industrial facilities are also used for application exercises.
Summary of How Funds Were Appropriated
Since 7/1/2016, the grant funds which were provided to UW-Stout by NIOSH were used to operationally
enhance the M.S. in Risk Control and Safety Management. Scholarships, stipends and professional
development opportunities were provided to 21 different graduate trainees. Funding for a one-third time
graduate assistantship awarded to an out-of-state student which permitted her/him to only pay in-state
tuition. This represents a tremendous tool for recruiting out-of-state students and individuals from
underrepresented / underserved backgrounds. The NIOSH grant funding was used to support instructional
needs to purchase various forms of ergonomic and industrial hygiene equipment. Finally, the grant
provided faculty with the necessary funding to participate in professional development-related
opportunities such as conferences and online courses."
10884198,"Abstract:
The LRRK2 locus, coding for the LRRK2 (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2) protein, is a major risk factor for
Parkinson’s disease (PD), and mutations in the LRRK2 gene contribute to both genetic and sporadic PD.
Intriguingly, the LRRK2 locus also confers increased risk for Crohn’s disease and leprosy, and LRRK2 is
expressed in immune cells, neurons and glia. We recently discovered that LRRK2 interacts with NOD-like
receptor (NLR) sensor family proteins (NLRPs), NLRP1 and NLRP3. NLRP proteins are key mediators of innate
immunity, and are components of inflammasomes. We propose to test the hypothesis that mutant LRRK2
interacts with and activates the NLRP3- and NLRP1-inflammasomes leading to microglial activation and
neurodegeneration contributing to PD pathology. In Aim 1, we will characterize the interaction of LRRK2 with
NLRP1 and NLRP3 in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether mutant LRRK2 activates the NLRP3-
infammasome in microglial activation, leading to neuroinflammation and degeneration in vitro and in vivo. In
Aim3, we will examine whether mutant LRRK2 activates the NLRP1-inflammsome in neurons, resulting in
neurodegeneration. These studies will elucidate mechanisms underlying LRRK2-linked inflammasome pathway
in neurodegeneration and immune dysfunction. They may also have broader implications for other neurological
diseases related to neuroinflammation. The understanding of NLRP/LRRK2-linked pathways in PD pathogenesis
may reveal potential biomarkers, and may provide novel targets for development of disease-modifying
therapeutic strategies. Thus, this project has the potential for significant impact, and benefits those suffering from
PD and other neurodegenerative diseases."
10774274,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and atypical behavior.
AS results from a loss of expression of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) from the maternal allele. The
UBE3A gene is paternally imprinted (i.e., repressed) in most neurons of humans and mice. Deletion, mutation,
or loss of expression of the maternal allele results in AS. Individuals with AS display impaired motor coordination
(e.g., inability to reach objects), gait deficits (i.e., instability while walking), and seizures. There are no
interventions for ameliorating gait deficits. A critical barrier for treating this condition is that the molecular
mechanisms that give rise to gait deficits in AS are unknown. Proprioception confers the ability to sense
movement, balance, and limb position. The mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in sensory
neurons innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, where it mediates proprioception, gait, and
balance. Mice and humans lacking PIEZO2 expression have an unsteady gait, increased stride-to-stride
variability in step length, and postural deficits. The rationale for these studies relies on the evidence from human
genetics and mouse models suggesting that individuals with AS or PIEZO2 loss-of-function mutations may share
mechanosensation deficits. Our hypothesis is that AS-associated gait deficits originate from reduced PIEZO2
function in sensory neurons. Our preliminary data support our hypothesis because it shows that PIEZO2 currents
are reduced in Ube3a-deficient mouse neurons, human cells with UBE3A knock-down, and stem cell-derived
neurons from individuals with AS. There are no available agonists to increase PIEZO2 activity. Molecules that
enhance PIEZO2 function could bypass the mechanical deficits associated with the loss of UBE3A expression.
We determined that a safflower oil diet, enriched in linoleic acid (LA), increases PIEZO2 currents and mechanical
excitability, as well as improves gait in AS mice. Likewise, LA supplementation enhances PIEZO2 function in
stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with AS. Our overall objective is to determine the mechanisms by
which loss of UBE3A expression decreases PIEZO2 currents (and/or expression) and LA recovers channel
function. To this end, we will carry out electrophysiological, biochemical, biophysical, and behavioral analyses to
provide a detailed understanding of the contribution of UBE3A and PIEZO2 to AS. We will pursue three Specific
Aims: 1) Determine the mechanism whereby loss of UBE3A expression decreases PIEZO2 currents, 2)
Determine the mechanism by which LA increases PIEZO2 activity, and 3) Test the hypothesis that LA
ameliorates gait deficits in AS through PIEZO2. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that accounts for diminished PIEZO2 currents in
AS and the role of LA-enriched membranes in increasing PIEZO2 function."

 This Focused Technology Research and Development proposal addresses the urgent need for new tools to
perform in vitro site-specific modification of DNA and RNA nucleobases of long nucleic acid substrates. The
biochemistry, biophysics, and biology of DNA and RNA are heavily influenced by particular nucleobase
modifications. However, studies of these modifications are often limited by the ability to synthesize the modified
nucleic acids. Therefore, innovative new technologies are required to circumvent the limitations of the existing
chemical and enzymatic modification approaches.
 DNAzymes (deoxyribozymes) are artificial DNA sequences with enzymatic function, analogous to protein
enzymes as catalytic sequences of amino acids. Although DNAzymes are unknown in nature, they can be
identified de novo in the laboratory by starting with random DNA sequence pools and performing in vitro selection
for the desired enzymatic activity. DNAzymes are operationally simple to obtain and use: they are readily
prepared commercially by solid-phase synthesis, and they easily modify their substrates in simple aqueous
incubation conditions with standard buffers and salts. DNAzymes have been identified for a growing range of
catalytic activities, but most applications of DNAzymes are limited to the two long-known reactions of RNA
cleavage and hemin-dependent peroxidation, which are unrelated to DNA and RNA nucleobase modification.
 In the proposed studies, DNAzymes will be identified for a qualitatitvely new approach to site-specific in vitro
modification of DNA and RNA nucleobases, by either N-acylation or (via reductive amination) N-alkylation at N4
of cytosine, N2 of guanine, and N6 of adenine. Rather than relying on natural protein enzymes, either as found
in nature or evolved by directed evolution, entirely new DNAzymes whose sequences are unconstrained by
natural evolutionary history will be identified by in vitro selection.
 Three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, in vitro selection will be used to identify DNAzymes for N-
acylation of C, G, and A nucleobase amines in DNA and RNA substrates. In parallel Aim 2, in vitro selection will
be used to identify DNAzymes for N-alkylation by reductive amination of C, G, and A nucleobase amines in DNA
and RNA substrates. In both of these aims, the electrophilic reaction partner will be either an oligonucleotide or
a small molecule, as a tunably fluorinated aryl ester for the acyl donor in Aim 1, and as an aromatic or aliphatic
aldehyde, or activated imine variant thereof, for the reductive amination partner in Aim 2. In Aim 3, the DNAzymes
from Aims 1 and 2 will be characterized with regard to their substrate sequence scope and refined by reselection
for improved function, to facilitate practical use as an innovative new technology for site-specific DNA and RNA
nucleobase modification.
 By the conclusion of the proposed efforts, we will have established DNAzymes as an important new
technology for in vitro site-specific DNA and RNA nucleobase modification by N-acylation and N-alkylation."

There is significant unmet need among seriously ill patients and gaps in quality of communication with health
care providers, which are particularly pronounced among historically underserved populations, including
patients of racial/ethnic minorities, low socioeconomic status (SES), limited English proficiency (LEP), and
those who live in rural areas who are underserved in health care. For patients suffering from serious illness,
palliative care provides expert pain and symptom management and planning for end-of-life care. In particular,
palliative care offered via telehealth may improve access to outpatient palliative care services, which are
predominantly offered in large academic medical centers in metropolitan areas. Despite an increase in
telehealth for outpatient palliative care since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about
the perspectives of historically underserved patients on modality of palliative care and how communication
may be impacted by a virtual mode of delivery for these patients who already experience inequities in receipt of
goal-concordant care. In this prospective cohort study, we will enroll a cohort of adult patients referred to
outpatient palliative care who are of low SES, non-White, LEP, or rurally-residing communities to compare
care experiences of in-person versus tele-palliative care visits provided to historically underserved patients and
their caregivers and understand the nuances around their needs and preferences for modality of care. Using
mixed methods we will 1) evaluate both patient- and caregiver-reported experience with in-person and tele-
palliative care over time using patient and caregiver-specific surveys and in-depth interviews with patients and
caregivers; 2) compare communication quality and use of recommended communication processes between in-
person and tele-palliative care using an analysis of recorded in-person and telehealth visits; and 3) examine
perspectives of in-person visits versus tele-palliative care including perceived barriers and facilitators to both
modes of delivery using qualitative interviews with palliative care providers. The proposed research will
improve understanding of the experiences of historically underserved patients and their family caregivers to
address issues around mode of delivery of palliative care. Findings will provide a roadmap for health systems to
improve patient-provider communication and identify strategies to promote cultural competence to improve
experience and overall quality of palliative care delivered both in person and via telehealth."
10873235,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an ocular neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for
approximately half of all cases of blindness and visual disability in developed nations. It is estimated that around
288 million people will be diagnosed with AMD worldwide by 2040. The neovascular form of AMD, accounting
for about 80% of the severe vision loss in patients with AMD, is characterized by neovascularization in the sub-
retinal space. Subretinal fibrosis demarcates end-stage neovascular AMD, causing irreparable vision loss, even
with anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, it is imperative to unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning subretinal
fibrosis formation and develop drug-based therapies not only for macular neovascularization (MNV) but also to
prevent or treat subretinal fibrosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) of the retinal epithelial cell (RPE) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) of either the
choroidal or retinal endothelial cells all contribute to the mesenchymal cell population in subretinal fibrotic lesions.
Additionally, EndoMT leads to an increase in endothelial barrier permeability and could provide an explanation
for the reduced efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment over time. Therefore, therapies designed to inhibit or reverse
EMT and EndoMT could stabilize endothelial barrier function and prevent or reduce subretinal fibrosis. Various
extracellular cytokines and growth factors are involved in activating MNV, EMT, and EndoMT. We have identified
the small GTPase ARF6 as a convergence point in signaling pathways activated by many of these cytokines and
growth factors. Thus, we hypothesize that ARF6 activation induces MNV, EMT, and EndoMT, thereby
contributing to the onset of subretinal fibrosis, and that genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of ARF6 will
reduce both MNV and subretinal fibrosis in neovascular AMD. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three aims.
In Aim 1, we will determine whether ARF6 activation is required for choroidal and retinal EndoMT and subretinal
fibrosis in laser-induced CNV and JR5558 mouse models. We will also use the laser-induced CNV model,
endothelial cell lineage tracing, and single cell RNAseq to determine the role of ARF6 in EndoMT. In Aim 2, we
will determine whether ARF6 activation is required for RPE EMT and subretinal fibrosis in laser-induced CNV
and JR5558 mouse models and use cell lineage tracing and single cell RNAseq to determine the function of
ARF6 in EMT. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether EMT and EndoMT act additively or synergistically to promote
neovascular AMD and whether pharmacologic inhibition of ARF6 can reduce neovascular AMD in mouse
models. This study could have a major impact on the future treatment of neovascular AMD by identifying ARF6
as a potential target for drug development. Moreover, this study could also have important implications for the
treatment of other ocular vascular diseases, e.g., proliferative vitreoretinopathy, epiretinal membranes, and
retinal fibrosis in fibrovascular diseases, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity."
10808917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and infection-related
exacerbations of asthma, are responsible for nearly one-third of all emergency department (ED) visits and 40%
of all infection-related hospitalizations in children each year in the United States. While viruses are responsible
for the vast majority of LRTIs, antibiotics are very frequently prescribed. In fact, more days of antibiotic use are
attributable to LRTI than any other condition in children’s hospitals. Starting antibiotics unnecessarily, using
less effective or overly broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treating for longer durations than necessary all
contribute to inappropriate antibiotic use in pediatric LRTI in both ED and inpatient settings. Use of
unnecessary antibiotics has profound consequences, including common and uncommon but severe adverse
side effects, increased health care utilization and costs, and fueling the development of antimicrobial
resistance, an ongoing global public health threat. To curtail inappropriate antibiotic use, Antimicrobial
Stewardship Programs (ASPs) have become commonplace in United States hospitals and have proven to be
effective. Unfortunately, the benefits of ASPs have largely failed to translate to the unique and fast-paced ED
environment. This represents a key missed opportunity since many more children are cared for in the ED as
compared to inpatient settings, and because ED care often critically influences subsequent hospital care. Our
prior research suggests that high quality electronic health record-based clinical decision support (CDS) is a
strategy that could bridge the ED antibiotic stewardship gap and reduce inappropriate prescribing in the ED
and hospital. Our proposed research builds upon this foundational work and leverages an accomplished and
diverse study team with expertise across the continuum of clinical care and in biomedical informatics, clinical
and health services research, implementation science, and biostatistics, all housed within supportive and well-
resourced research environments. Within three children’s hospitals, we will: define critical facilitators and
barriers governing use and acceptance of antibiotic CDS at the point of care in the ED and inpatient settings
(Aim 1); create two CDS interventions seamlessly integrated into clinician workflows in the ED and inpatient
settings, including a) an antibiotic advisor (Abx CDS), and b) a real-time ASP tool (ASP CDS) (Aim 2);
measure the effectiveness of Abx CDS and ASP CDS, alone and in combination, against usual care for
increasing appropriate antibiotic use in pediatric LRTI in the ED and inpatient settings within the framework of a
pragmatic randomized controlled trial (Aim 3); and evaluate Reach, Adoption, and Implementation domains
within the trial among encounters receiving Abx CDS and ASP CDS (Aim 4). We hypothesize that we will
create stewardship-focused CDS tools that meaningfully improve antibiotic use for children with LRTI and that
are scalable in order to optimize care delivery and outcomes across a wide variety of settings."

In the era of big clinical data, the availability of rich real-world clinical data sources (RWcD) enables the
development of predictive models for different clinical events, bringing the potential to improve efficiency and
lower the cost of health care. However, the currently in-use models in practice are mostly trained on local data,
introducing issues of bias and lack of generalizability. We will develop comprehensive methods to efficiently
train high-quality clinical foundation model (CFM) that learn informative representations from patients'
structured clinical data either in the form of EHR or claims. Specifically, how to train CFM that can maximize
the performance boost for any downstream prediction tasks regardless of the predictive model architecture and
the size of the available training data. In this application we propose to 1) Develop a flexible framework to
intake the temporal structured clinical data elements from heterogenous sources and enrich it with existing
knowledge, 2) Optimize the foundation model architecture and pre-training strategy, 3) Develop prompting
strategies for zero/few shot learning, and 4) Evaluating CFM on multiple clinical downstream tasks."

Understanding how the coordination of transcription factors bind to non-coding DNA provides mechanistic
insights into transcriptional regulation. Recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs) have
revolutionized our ability to study regulatory genomics. While they have demonstrated improved predictions
compared to previous methods based on traditional computational genomics, their low interpretability has earned
them a reputation as a black box. To address this gap, post hoc model interpretability methods have emerged
to interrogate important features that the network has learned. Of these, attribution maps have demonstrated
promise, providing importance scores for each nucleotide in a given sequence; these have a natural
interpretation as single-nucleotide variant effects. In principle, attribution maps should contain information to
identify motifs that are important for cell-type specific regulatory functions and annotate their positions at base-
resolution. However, attribution maps are often noisy in practice; in addition to motifs, they contain spurious
importance scores for arbitrary nucleotides for reasons that are not well established. Despite their promise,
interpreting a DNN through attribution maps remains challenging. Here we propose three complementary aims
that serve to maximize the biological insights that we can achieve from attribution maps for genomic DNNs. In
Aim 1, we will develop a model selection framework to identify the optimal DNN from a set of candidate DNNs
that yields high generalization performance and interpretable attribution maps. In Aim 2, we will develop robust
training strategies based on regularization and data augmentations tailored for genomics, with the broader aim
of ensuring that DNNs yield high-quality attribution maps and high generalization. In Aim 3, we will develop and
employ interpretable computational methods to directly analyze attribution maps to facilitate discovery of
functional motifs and annotate their positions. Each aim will be implemented as open-source software in
TensorFlow and PyTorch. As the number of deep learning applications in genomics is rising quickly, the
biomedical community will greatly benefit from these user-friendly computational tools by enabling the
deployment of robust training and interpretability analysis for any DNN trained on functional genomics assays.
This, in turn, will drive new discoveries in cis-regulatory biology across the many biological systems that deep
learning has already been applied to and the new applications that will continue to emerge in the future."

Both the impacts from COVID-19 as well as the increasing complexities of clinical trials, with a particular
emphasis on precision medicine trials, have led to a recent decline in enrollments. This proposal identifies
strategies to address the challenges of enhancing clinical trial enrollments in the hematologic malignancies (HM)
program at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC). The two-pronged approach tackles
system barriers and patient barriers. A clinical trial toolkit will be developed to address systems barriers with the
goal of minimizing inefficiencies within our research operations program, increasing enrollment, and ultimately
creating a clinical trial portfolio that best serves our patients. Components of the toolkit include metrics to ensure
feasibility of trials, establish a prioritization queue for resourcing potential studies, trackers for effort and finances,
and performance standards. With many patients preferring to receive their care closer to home, while also having
access to the same novel approaches offered at academic medical centers, the proposal seeks to extend our
clinical research studies to satellite sites. To achieve that end, Dr. Wagner-Johnston addresses strategies to
create the necessary research culture to enhance enrollment. Focus will be placed on establishing leadership
and providing a collaborative learning culture at the satellite sites. Rational portfolio building at the satellite sites
will rely on the same metrics developed as part of the toolkit. Engagement from both physicians and prospective
trial participants is essential and this proposal outlines practical approaches to attend to these concerns.
Involvement in routine research meetings and recognition of physicians' effort in consenting to trials will
incentivize trial participation. Outreach efforts including monthly email newsletters to referring physicians,
updates to our HM website, as well as a better tool to identify potential trials for patients are planned. We will
extend the ongoing work of community health educators affiliated with projects initiated by the Diversity and
Inclusion in Clinical Research Program at SKCCC to include our patients with HM. The outlined research strategy
seeks to improve the operational aspects beginning with pre-trial activation through study closure. Attention to
increased efficiencies will be essential in bringing needed research to satellite sites. Best practices identified
from this project will be readily transferrable to the entire cancer center enterprise at SKCCC and shared with
other academic medical centers. As a nationally recognized lymphoma expert with a strong commitment to the
NCTN and extensive knowledge in clinical research operations, Dr. Wagner-Johnston is poised to lead these
efforts and successfully enhance accruals."

Visualizing metabolic activities in situ is critical to understanding many biological processes. It
is the metabolism which carries out the genetic blue print and maintain life. Sugar such as
glucose is an essential nutrient for human being and animals, not only provides energy, but
also is building blocks for synthesizing new biomass such as protein, lipid, RNA/DNA, and
glycogen. Our proposed study is to develop and optimize a new generation of deuterated
glucose ([D]-glucose) probed 3D volumetric multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
imaging platform. In aim I, various types of [D]-glucose including [D1], [D2], [D5], [D7], and [D12]-
glucose will be studied and optimized for visualizing metabolic dynamics and heterogeneity in
animals. The carbon-deuterium (C-D) chemical bond in the newly synthesized molecules such
as C-D labeled proteins, lipids, DNA/RNA, carbohydrates will be imaged in the “cell silent
region” of Raman spectra. In addition, based on diverse spectral patterns of metabolites
derived from different isotopologues, metabolite synthesis in multiple time points will be
visualized in a single image. In Aim II, a new generation of enhanced tissue clearing recipe
will be screened and designed for large scale 3D volumetric imaging (20x deeper penetration)
of [D]-glucose probed metabolic activities and heterogeneity in animal models. In Aim III,
custom designed spectral unmixing algorithm and protocol will be established to maximize the
potential of detecting more than 20 newly synthesized C-D labeled molecules and minimize
the background signal. Our computational resources and algorithms will optimize numerous
variables in complicated hyperspectral imaging datasets for studying organ specific metabolic
dynamics and heterogeneity. Using the resources and algorithms, we will optimize a platform
to unmix multiple old and newly synthesized molecules and quantitatively dissect the in situ
detritions. Completion of the proposed study will potentially reveal mechanistic fundamentals
of multiple molecular pathways related to glucose metabolism in different organs."

Addiction is an enormous economic, personal, and social burden, costing over $600 billion per year in the U.S.
Understanding vulnerability to addiction, and developing effective therapies, requires identifying the genes and
pathways that mediate the addiction process. Our long-term goal is to develop novel genetic models for
addiction-relevant phenotypes, and use these models to characterize the genetic mechanisms of addiction. We
propose to leverage the Jackson Laboratory Knockout Mouse Project 2 (JAX KOMP2) pipeline to prioritize
addiction gene candidates, and then characterize the effects of candidate gene knockouts on addiction-related
behaviors and on addiction-relevant tissues. The JAX KOMP2 Phenotyping Center performs high-throughput
phenotyping of knockout mice across organ systems using an efficient, broad-based testing pipeline including
behavioral assays for emotionality and sleep, both predictive of addiction phenotypes. Here we propose to
exploit this rich KOMP2 dataset to select a subset of lines with emotionality and neuronal phenotypes (e.g.
deviant open field, light dark, hole board, tail suspension, prepulse inhibition, rotarod, electroconvulsive seizure
threshold, or sleep phenotypes) and lacking metabolism and physiology phenotypes. Our preliminary data
provide compelling evidence that gene deletions leading to emotionality phenotypes in the KOMP pipeline
have addiction phenotypes. We will subject these lines to deep drug abuse–relevant phenotyping, including
drug self-administration, transcriptional profiling from key neuronal tissues, and whole brain imaging. The data
from these will be integrated using systems analysis. The successful completion of this project will yield dozens
of novel mouse models with detailed transcriptome, and neuroanatomical profile to establish mechanistic
insight into this behavioral abnormality. These can serve are a resource for the research community for
therapeutics development."
10828446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over two-thirds of children experience traumatic events such as child maltreatment, violence, or sudden or
violent loss. Many of these children sustain significant emotional and developmental difficulties including trauma
symptoms, aggression, and suicidality. Emotional support from a caregiver is theorized to buffer against the
effects of trauma; however, many caregivers lack the self-efficacy and skills to effectively support their child, or
struggle to apply these skills during the stressful time following trauma. Unfortunately, programs designed for
caregivers following child trauma are scarce. Existing interventions are lengthy (lasting 8-20 sessions) and result
in families placed on long waitlists. This proposal asserts the adverse effects of child trauma can be interrupted
though a brief intervention (the Project Support Positive Parenting Module) that enhances supportive parenting
– delivered via telehealth to families on waitlists for trauma-focused services. Pilot data collected by the candidate
suggests this intervention can be delivered by paraprofessionals, improve parenting self-efficacy and emotional
support, and increase later trauma-focused treatment attendance. However, the provider characteristics (e.g.,
knowledge, experiences), as well as inner (e.g., organizational support) and outer (e.g., patient needs, attitudes)
contextual factors that influence uptake of a brief intervention for families on the waitlist for trauma services is
unknown. Aims 1 and 2 comprise the K99 Mentored Research Phase and Aim 3 comprises the R00 Independent
Research Phase. Specific Aims include: 1) examine barriers and facilitators to delivering Project Support via
telehealth with n = 20 caregivers and n = 10 treatment providers; 2) examine the feasibility and acceptability of
Project Support via telehealth in a mixed-methods proof-of-concept pilot trial with n = 30 families waiting for
trauma-focused services and n = 4 treatment providers; and 3) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Project
Support in a randomized controlled trial (Project Support vs. treatment as usual) among n = 100 families waiting
for trauma-focused services. The proposed research activities coincide with training that will support the
candidate’s transition to an independent investigator. In the K99 phase the candidate will receive training via
coursework, workshops, and consultation in: (1) implementation science frameworks and dissemination
strategies, (2) qualitative and mixed methodology, and (3) grantsmanship and scientific communication.
Mentorship and consultation from experts in child trauma, caregiver-child relationships, implementation science,
qualitative methods, and statistical analyses will ensure training goals are met. This proposal will support the
candidate’s long-term career goal to become an independently funded tenure track faculty who advances the
field of child trauma research by studying the consequences of children’s trauma exposure and developing and
testing innovative parenting-based interventions for victims of trauma and their families. This K99/R00
mechanism is a critical step to obtaining the experience and independence necessary to obtain this goal."
10872201,"Project Summary
Noonan Syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder characterized by congenital heart disease, dysmorphic
facial structures, short stature, and mental retardation, is caused by germline mutations in the genes involved
in the Ras signaling pathway. Patients with NS are at an increased risk of developing leukemia. The
mechanisms underlying the leukemogenesis are not completely understood. NS is mainly (>50%) associated
with germline heterozygous activating mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 (SHP2), and NS
patients with PTPN11 mutations have the worst prognosis. Studies from our laboratory and others have
established the causal role of hematopoietic cell intrinsic PTPN11 mutations in the pathogenesis of NS-
associated leukemia. Notably, in the last funding period we discovered that PTPN11 activating mutations
(E76K or D61G) in the bone marrow (BM) stroma, specifically Nestin-expressing and Nestin-expressing cell-
derived mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitors, contributed significantly to the development/
progression of hematological malignancies in mouse models. However, our understanding of the effects of
PTPN11 disease mutations in the BM microenvironment is still incomplete. Our recent pilot data indicate that
PTPN11 activating mutations in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and other neural crest-derived progeny
in the BM stroma also exert detrimental effects on resident HSCs  neural crest-specific PTPN11E76K mutation
knock-in mice (PTPN11E76K/+/Wnt1-Cre+) developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), and this malignancy
originated from wild-type hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Furthermore, a donor cell-derived MPN (D-MPN)
developed in PTPN11E76K/+/Wnt1-Cre+ mice transplanted with healthy BM cells. The overall objective of this
application is to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the PTPN11 mutation in neural
crest-derived cells in the BM stroma induce a MPN. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that the PTPN11
mutation in these microenvironmental cells drives leukemia development by directly and/or indirectly
hyperactivating resident HSCs. We plan to test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application
by pursuing the following three aims. 1). To identify the cell type, protein factors, and/or neurotransmitters that
mediate the leukemogenic effect of PTPN11 activating mutations in the PNS and other neural crest derivatives
in the BM stroma. 2). To determine the molecular mechanisms by which PTPN11 gain-of-function activating
mutations deregulate the activities of the PNS and other neural crest-derived cells. 3). To validate the
pathogenic effects of BM microenvironmental PTPN11 disease mutations with NS patient specimens and
patient-derived cells. The research proposed in this application will not only greatly advance our understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the leukemogenesis in NS, but also inform the rational design of new
therapeutic interventions for preventing leukemia development in NS and improving stem cell transplantation
therapy for NS-associated hematological malignancies."
10888209,"PROJECT SUMMARY: American youth are growing up in more contextually varied circumstances. These
circumstances profoundly impact health and well-being, both positively and negatively across the life course.
However, little is known about how economic, cultural, ethnic and family contexts become biologically
embedded and how this interaction with biology during development influences trajectories of developmental
and health outcomes. Part of the reason for the sparse knowledge is that few investigators have expertise in
the three domains necessary to successfully grapple with these questions, namely, developmental science of
context, human neurobiology, and advanced research methods. We propose a training program that will help
fill this gap. The objective is to train an outstanding cohort of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on 3
pillars of knowledge: (1) developmental science of context; (2) human neurobiology, including brain
development, genomics, and endocrine function; and (3) advanced research methods (e.g., predictive
analytics, machine learning, comparative approaches). This cross-training, which is predicated on an
understanding of basic developmental processes, will produce researchers well positioned to conduct cutting-
edge research that advances knowledge about how neurobiological factors interact with contexts to influence
development across multiple domains. Those who receive this training will meet the growing demand for
developmental scientists who integrate neuroscience perspectives and methods into their programs of
research and possess the requisite skills for successful, collaborative, interdisciplinary work at the interface of
neurobiology, context, and behavioral development. The demand for this expertise is strong and predicted to
grow for years to come, given the paucity of individuals with the interdisciplinary training and the exciting recent
advances in our understanding of the role of neurobiology in psychological development. We request funds to
support 4 advanced predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees each year. Trainees will engage in a 2-year series
of courses and direct mentor-based research training that will allow them to integrate work on context, human
neurobiology, and advanced methodology. Each trainee will have three mentors, covering (1) development of
context, (2) human neurobiology, and (3) advanced methodology. The training program will be housed in the
Developmental Area (within the Department of Psychology), which has 22 participating faculty members. An
additional strength is that the training grant includes 13 faculty members from other units including Human
Genetics, Biopsychology, Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience, Linguistics, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry. The
training will draw on the rich resources of the University of Michigan, including extensive training in integrative
research, and courses in advanced methodology/statistics. The training program will prepare predoctoral and
postdoctoral students to bridge research in the developmental science of context and human neurobiology in
order to determine how the social environment interacts with genetics and the brain to guide development."
10853074,"SUMMARY: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is on pace to become the dominant form
of heart failure, yet we have no treatments to offer patients, leaving them limited in terms of exercise tolerance
and quality of life. While much attention has been paid to the myocardium, data suggest that abnormalities in
skeletal muscle (SkM) oxygen utilization also contribute to exertional intolerance in this condition. Moreover,
decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability has been demonstrated in HFpEF patients. NO augments SkM
oxygen delivery and plays a key role in enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO), both of which are important for
submaximal exercise endurance. Recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin
(EMPA) have demonstrated remarkable benefits in other cardiovascular disease patients, though their use in
HFpEF remains unclear. EMPA could be beneficial in HFpEF patients via multiple mechanisms, many of which
target abnormalities identified specifically in HFpEF, including: (a) increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, (b)
increasing FAO, (c) increasing plasma ketone bodies, providing an additional source of acetyl-CoA for energy
production, and (d) increasing blood hemoglobin, augmenting oxygen delivery for any given blood flow.
Moreover, because NO is essential for FAO and a key mediator of exercise SkM blood flow, we propose that
combining EMPA with a NO-donor such as potassium nitrate (KNO3) will lead to improvements in exercise
capacity in HFpEF patients, as compared to EMPA alone or active control.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that impaired SkM oxidative phosphorylation capacity (OxPhos) limits
exercise tolerance in HFpEF. We focus on submaximal exercise endurance in this proposal as submaximal
exercise better reflects the level of exertion reached by HFpEF patients during daily activities, is more
dependent on FAO than maximal effort exercise, and is less likely to constrained by cardiac output limitations.
We will test the impact of three interventions in 53 HFpEF participants in a randomized double-blind cross-over
trial: (1) EMPA; (2) EMPA + KNO3; and (3) Potassium chloride (active control). In Aim 1: participants will
undergo cycle ergometry exercise tests. The primary endpoint will be the change in submaximal exercise
endurance. In Aim 2: We will test the impact of our 3 interventions on SkM OxPhos using MRI following
plantar flexion exercise. Novel MRI sequences will also be employed that quantify intramuscular perfusion. In
Aim 3: We will conduct SkM tissue biopsies to assess mitochondrial respiration, the SkM metabolome, and
quantify the SkM proteome, providing in vitro assessments to support our exercise measurements.
 Our proposal will target SkM metabolism in HFpEF and comprehensively assess the relationship
between SkM OxPhos and submaximal exercise endurance using complementary techniques. This proposal
has the potential to identify SkM metabolism as an important therapeutic target in this disease for which we
currently have no approved pharmacologic therapies."
10870043,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS,
its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes
are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of
pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much
interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies,
cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings
and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool.
Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and
treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of
cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and
meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance.
We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI.
Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T
MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS
(NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the
Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with
MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with
paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship
to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms
for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans.
Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of
the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput
studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field
MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS
pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM
lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME."
10845699,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal is to develop a miniature balun to meet the emerging meet in flexible RF coils in MRI. Flexible coils
improve patient comfort and can be formed into desired shapes to match the human anatomy of interest.
Therefore, compared to conventional rigid coils, they exhibit improved filling factor and signal-to-noise ratio,
especially when imaging curved anatomies such as cervical spinal cord, pelvis, and hands. Although the
challenges in building flexible coils have been solved with the numerous methods mentioned above, in practice,
it is still an open question to make fully flexible coils since the balun or cable trap circuits associated with coils
are still rigid and bulky. The first goal of this project is to theoretically analyze, build and test a miniature LC balun
with a novel topology, namely LCCC balun. The second goal of this project is to integrate the LCCC balun with
flexible receive-only coils and transmit/receive coils at 3T and 7T. The theoretical analysis, script for component
value calculation, circuit simulation models, and PCB designs, will be distributed for open access. This miniature
LCCC balun can be easily transferred to other RF coil designs, with benefits for the entire community."
10810705,"The Minneapolis Adaptive Design & Engineering (MADE) Program has recently developed ergonomic
wheelchairs that use a chain drive system to place the hand rims in an ergonomic position while keeping
the rear drive wheels posterior for a stable base of support. Our ergonomic wheelchair’s forward hand
rim positioning allows for a more efficient push along a longer arc length of the hand rims, without
sacrificing wheelchair stability or shoulder ergonomics.
The ergonomic wheelchair’s chain drive allows for individualized gear ratios to suit each wheelchair
user’s needs; however, we have not yet studied this feature. Thus, the objectives of this proposed work
are to (1) explore the effect of different gearing options on Veteran wheelchair user steady-state
propulsion efficiency, and (2) develop a multi-speed ergonomic wheelchair allowing for lower gears
during difficult situations (initiating movements, moving over carpeting) and higher gears for steady-
state movements on flat surfaces.
We will recruit 18 Veterans with SCI/D to participate in a cross-over study of the ergonomic wheelchair
with three gear ratios (3:2 (low), 1:1 (normal), and 2:3 (high)). We will use two measurement
approaches to assess efficiency: (1) work done at the pushrim hubs to move the wheelchair in Joules
(J), and (2) the measurement of energy (kCal: kilocalories) expended by the Veteran to move the
wheelchair. Similar to miles per gallon in a car, we will calculate distances traveled in meters (m) per
energy units (m/J and m/kCal) as our measures of efficiency. We hypothesize that (H1) Higher gear
ratios will be more efficient (higher m/J) on hard level terrain than lower gear ratios, (H2) Lower gear
ratios will be more efficient (higher m/J) for inclined terrain than higher gear ratios, (H3) Lower gear
ratios will be more efficient (higher m/J) for carpeted terrain than higher gear ratios, and (H4) Veterans
will be more efficient (higher m/kCal) in moving the wheelchair during the 6MPT on hard level terrain
when using higher gear ratios compared with lower gear ratios. In addition to steady-state measures,
we will also explore the effects of gearing on propulsion initiation and expect lower gear ratios will be
beneficial for initiation on all terrains.
We will then recruit 12 Veterans to try a new multi-speed ergonomic wheelchair that has two hand rims
per side – one in a lower gear and the other in a higher gear. The proposed system does not require
manual or electric shifting between gears. Instead, the Veteran can use the lower gear to initiate
movements and then “shift on the fly” by simply pushing on the other hand rim. Veterans will return to
the laboratory and provide feedback as the design is iteratively improved. Quantitative and qualitative
data will be captured to determine feasibility of this approach and to promote commercialization of the
multi-speed ergonomic wheelchair.
Throughout the project, our team will work closely with VA’s Technology Transfer Program and the
TechLink Center to find an industry partner for this work. Our team has demonstrated the ability to
develop rehabilitation products into commercially licensed products. We will follow a similar stage-gate
process in this development project to maximize our chances for successful commercialization of the
modular multi-speed ergonomic wheelchair."
10848328,"Project Summary / Abstract
Recent research indicates that when ~808 to 830 nm light is applied in immediate juxtaposition to target neurons
or axons (within mm) through invasive techniques, C and Aδ fibers that convey pain-related information can
temporarily and reversibly be “turned off” without affecting the functionality of the larger A fibers. If further
developed, this photobiomodulation (PBM) effect has exciting possibilities as an implantable device-based
treatment for various chronic pain syndromes, including neuropathic pains. This project takes important steps to
develop fundamental and mechanistic understanding, and to provide a foundation for translation.
 In terms of fundamental and mechanistic understanding – first, the effect of PBM dose and wavelength on
axonal block (in an ex vivo peripheral nerve preparation) and nociceptive response (in an in vivo rodent pain
model) will be rigorously characterized. These data will provide important mechanistic insight and translational
value. Second, the role of observed microtubule destabilization and the resulting axonal varicosities will be
explored as contributors to the mechanism of the independently-observed action potential block. We will
determine whether or not there is a correlation between effect size (functional data) and degree of microtubule
instability (confocal microscopy and electron microscopy data). Computational models will be used to evaluate
the effect of axonal varicosities on action potential propagation. Finally, the effect of pharmacological microtubule
(de)stabilizers on PAB dose will be assessed.
 In terms of translational activities – the project includes development of pre-clinical-grade systems that allow
PBM at the nerve to be applied chronically with the ultimate goal of demonstrating that chronic PBM can provide
a persistent and profound analgesic effect in a large animal pain model (porcine). A fully implantable system
based on an existing commercial neurostimulator will enable PBM to be delivered over extended periods of time.
A percutaneous system will require repeated interventions over time (e.g., weekly interventions on the order of
minutes), but will enable use of higher peak powers not achievable with the fully implantable system. The
systems will be used in a porcine pain model (peripheral neuritis) that better mimicked the human response to
pharmacological interventions than rodent models have been able to do. The pre-clinical studies will include a
30-day pilot study followed by a 6-month study in minipigs.
 In summary, this project will expand fundamental understanding of PBM-induced axonal block with an eye
toward translational devices suitable for the treatment of chronic pain."
10842353,"Abstract: Project 4, Duke University
Leptospirosis is a common, potentially life-threatening infection of global significance. The bacteria spread from
a variety of different host animals to humans typically through contact with infected urine. As a result,
leptospirosis is a leading cause of fever in the tropics. Leptospirosis can cause severe disease resulting in organ
failure and death. Although the infection is responsive to antibiotics, treatment is often delayed due to similarities
with other causes of fever (e.g., dengue) and limitations of current diagnostic tests. Leptospira spp. do not grow
in standard culture media, molecular pathogen detection methods suffer from insufficient sensitivity throughout
the course of the disease, and acute-phase serology is both insensitive and non-specific. Paired (acute and
convalescent) sera can confirm acute infection retrospectively, but convalescent follow-up is infrequent. A
growing body of evidence supports the potential for the development of molecular biomarkers based on the
human immune response to the infection to not only detect infectious pathogen but also predict disease severity
in infectious diseases.
The development and validation of these “host response” diagnostic tests requires rigorous prospective studies
of leptospirosis in diverse locations where different strains of the bacteria are common in people of different
ancestral backgrounds. Our research team has 20 years of experience conducting such studies on 3 continents:
Sri Lanka (Galle), Nicaragua (Leon), and Tanzania (Moshi) where the epidemiology of leptospirosis is well
established. In addition to being relatively common, severe disease is well documented in Nicaragua and Sri
Lanka to support development of diagnostics predictive of disease progression. Our team has extensive
experience in generating the relevant molecular data (gene and protein expression) and the analytical, machine-
learning tools for developing multi-analyte host response classifiers for pathogen differentiation across the
course of infection which can be applied to identify and predict the severity of leptospirosis. The team also has
experience translating these sets of biomarkers onto existing diagnostic platforms. In this project, we will add to
our existing biorepository of samples from three geographically diverse locations to support the development of
leptospirosis-specific molecular classifiers for both diagnosis and prediction of disease severity. Importantly,
critical preliminary data and an unparalleled biorepository of samples and clinical data support Project 4 and
synergize with Projects 1-3 in the proposed research program. Project 4 will be led by Megan E. Reller, MD,
PhD, MPH."
10929967,"Background: Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) is a unique home care program that provides
comprehensive, longitudinal primary care to Veterans with complex chronic disease with an interdisciplinary
team of VA staff. HBPC enrollment is associated with reduced hospitalizations, reduced health care costs, and
high patient satisfaction, and is a critical component of the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care’s (GEC’s)
strategy to shift long term services and supports into home and community-based services.
Significance: GEC plans to expand HBPC by 75 sites by 2026, but there is substantial variation in individual
HBPC site structures, populations served, care delivery patterns, and clinical outcomes. It is unknown whether
this variation represents variable fidelity to the HBPC clinical model and an opportunity to improve efficiency
vs. appropriate flexibility and adaptation to varying patient needs and local contexts. Given planned expansion,
a detailed understanding of program variation is needed to understand which configurations of program
features are successful in what contexts and why.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal uses configurational analysis, an emerging mixed-methods approach, to
identify configurations of HBPC program and contextual characteristics associated with longer patient home
time, a novel patient-centered outcome measure. Patient home time is a novel measure that captures a
universal goal in HBPC, the time a Veteran can live independently at home. Results of this study will inform
HBPC expansion and will help existing engage in context-tailored quality improvement efforts.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess variation among HBPC sites in contextual and modifiable factors, patient
characteristics, and care delivery patterns, and identify site and patient level correlates of clinical outcomes.
Aim 2: Assess HBPC team member and Veteran perspectives on potential mechanisms of success in sites
that are high and low performing in patient home time. Aim 3: Identify factors that distinguish HBPC sites with
higher versus lower performance in patient home time.
Methodology: Aim 1 is a quantitative study in which we will build descriptive profiles of all 440 HBPC sites
using VA and Medicare data and perform regression analysis and cluster analyses to examine site and patient
level correlates of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2 we will perform qualitative interviews of HBPC clinicians, staff,
and Veterans, and observation of work practices in 10 HBPC sites with high performance and 10 with low
performance in patient home time. Aim 3 will use configurational analysis, a cross case analysis method rooted
in mathematical set theory, to identify features identified in Aims 1 and 2 that are necessary and/or sufficient
for longer patient home time.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will work with partners in GEC to use identified configurations of HBPC site
features to inform HBPC expansion, and to facilitate the development of a complexity informed, adaptive
quality improvement intervention for use in existing HBPC sites."
10870225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to fill gaps in our understanding of early heart failure stages and of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Over half of all heart failure patients have HFpEF, and are more likely to
be older, diabetic, obese, hypertensive and have a prognosis that is equally poor as those with reduced
ejection fraction. No treatment has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with HFpEF, highlighting an
urgent need to understand the heterogeneous phenotypes and underlying biologic and physiologic
mechanisms for HFpEF. We have established a prospective cohort of South Asians called the Mediators of
Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study that is closely tied to the Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) for efficient cross-ethnic comparisons. We have found that South Asians have
significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and metabolic abnormalities, even with normal body mass index,
compared to the four MESA race/ethnic groups. Additionally, South Asians have very high levels of fat stored
in ectopic depots (in the liver, muscle and around the abdominal viscera). This unique cohort with its distinct
phenotype can be leveraged to understand the metabolic effects and mechanisms involved in heart failure. In
this proposed study, we will use the thorough baseline and repeated metabolic characterization of MASALA
study participants and will measure heart failure stages among 850 MASALA participants in a new Exam 3. We
will characterize heart failure stages by symptoms, dynamic echocardiography, NTproBNP, and HFpEF will be
confirmed by exercise stress echocardiography. We propose to 1) determine the epidemiology of heart failure
among middle to older aged South Asians and compare heart failure stages and HFpEF prevalence in South
Asians to the four MESA race/ethnic groups. We will determine whether differences in heart failure stages and
HFpEF prevalence between South Asians and MESA groups are mediated by differences in dysglycemia,
ectopic fat and other metabolic factors; 2) determine whether endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and
coronary microvascular dysfunction drive HFpEF in South Asians, and if they mediate the association between
dysglycemia, adiposity, and HFpEF; and 3) determine the blood-based proteomic signatures of heart failure
and HFpEF among South Asians. We will identify, verify, and validate the proteomics profile of heart failure
and HFpEF, and determine the immunologic signatures characterizing HFpEF. We expect that South Asians
will have a high prevalence of HFpEF, and that we will better define the phenotype and underlying
mechanisms for HFpEF relevant for metabolically unhealthy but normal weight populations."

A few hundred genes in mammals are regulated by genomic imprinting. These genes are epigenetically
marked and exhibit parental-specific expression. Imprinting plays a role in the transmission of a number of
human disorders, including Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS), Prader-
Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome, in that the sex of the parent that transmits the affected gene(s)
determines whether offspring will be affected. Aberrant imprinted gene expression is also involved in the onset
or progression of cancers, such as Wilms tumors. The overall goal of our work is to elucidate the mechanism
by which parental identity of imprinted genes is established and maintained. The in-depth study of imprinted
genes can additionally inform our understanding of genome regulation and nuclear architecture as imprinted
genes are located in large domains and are often regulated by long non-coding RNAs, CTCF-dependent
insulators, and allele-specific epigenetic modifications. These studies will employ the H19/Igf2 and
Grb10/Ddc1a imprinted domains, both of which harbor CTCF-binding imprinting control regions (ICRs), which
regulate imprinting. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the role of the H19/Igf2 ICR in allelic DNA methylation
acquisition and the maintenance of imprinting. We will engineer mice with humanized ICRs and human iPSCs
that have common BWS deletions and study the mechanism by which these deletions contribute to DNA
methylation defects and loss of imprinting. Additionally, because mice inheriting the full-length humanized ICR
paternally fail to establish and maintain DNA methylation, we will assess the cause of this male germline-
specific DNA methylation failure, providing insight into how paternally-methylated ICRs are epigenetically
modified in the male germline. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism of imprinting at the
Grb10/Ddc1a imprinted locus. These genes exhibit tissue-specific imprinting; Grb10 is expressed from the
maternal allele in somatic cells and switches to the paternal allele in neurons while the Ddc1a isoform is
expressed from the paternal allele in heart. To determine the role of CTCF in allele- and tissue-specific
expression, we will generate CTCF binding site deletions in the ICR in mice and examine the consequences of
these mutations on imprinting of Grb10 and Ddc1a. We have also identified a new tissue and allele-specific
CTCF-binding element that is developmentally regulated and critical to Grb10/Ddc1a imprinting, which we
propose to function as an insulator. We will investigate this newly described insulator through deletion of a
putative mesoderm-specific enhancer. Together, these experiments will enable a greater understanding of
imprinting as well as regulation of parental allelic modifications, chromatin and genome architecture."
10849748,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The dynamic regulation of chromatin is critical for proper gene expression, and dysregulation leads to diseases
including cancer and metabolic disorders. The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is formed by
a histone protein core around which DNA wraps. The unstructured histone termini, referred to as histone tails,
protrude from this core and are key players in chromatin regulation. Incorporation of histone post-translational
modifications (PTMs, chemical or protein modification of histone residues) and histone variants (histones with
distinct sequences that substitute for canonical histones) are two major mechanisms of chromatin regulation,
and they act in part through the histone tails. Despite great strides being made in understanding the chromatin
landscape, large gaps remain in our knowledge of chromatin structure, gene regulation, and the histone
language. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to define the chromatin landscape (the complex molecular
interactions within and between nucleosomes along with their genetic and epigenetic factors) that underlies gene
expression so that dysregulation that causes human disease can be corrected. The objective is to develop a
molecular-level understanding of the conformation and dynamics of the histone tails within the nucleosome along
with their bridging interactions (altogether, the histone tail landscape) and how these translate to the level of
chromatin structure and accessibility. This includes determining how histone tail landscapes are perturbed by
histone post-translational modifications and histone variants and how these landscapes are interconnected with
each other and those of other nucleosome components. In this five-year MIRA proposal, the focus will be on: 1)
determining how lysine acylations differentially regulate the histone tail landscape to contribute to metabolically-
linked differential gene regulation, and 2) the variant-specific role of the centromeric H3 variant in regulating
chromatin structure during mitosis and chromosome stability. A pairing of solution NMR spectroscopy with other
biophysical approaches and phase separation studies, as proposed here, is essential to decipher this highly
dynamic and heterogeneous system. Understanding the structural and dynamic effects of histone PTMs and
variants on regulatory control of gene expression and chromatin structure will lead to a significant enhancement
in our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and epigenetically-linked diseases."

Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not
studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the
study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic
(ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from
the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that
follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team
includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas
Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari
Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran
twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that
demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility
of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD,
autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll
participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD
symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave
alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher
PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also
hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic
twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between
everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that
acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher
TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible
mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our
hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result
higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large
project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and"

Heart failure (HF) continuous to be a major health care challenge. Altered myocyte calcium (Ca) signaling is an
essential part of the pathophysiology of HF and of critical relevance in the search for new effective therapies.
Despite progress in the elucidation of Ca-dependent processes occurring on rapid time scales, mechanisms
whereby Ca modulates slow cardiac processes, including long term adaptations to physiological and pathological
stress, remain poorly understood. This critical barrier to progress is attributable to our poor understanding of
foundational aspects of cardiomyocyte biology, including sites and mechanisms of protein synthesis, processing
and delivery. This is compounded by the lack of technological tools for probing and tracking slower / long-lived
molecular process in living myocytes. Store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), wherein depletion of intracellular Ca
stores prompts extracellular Ca entry into the cytosol, has recently emerged as an important component of
cardiomyocyte Ca signaling. SOCE is mediated by the stromal interaction molecule (STIM1), which, upon
sensing sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca depletion, interacts with and activates the sarcolemmal Ca-
release activated channel protein (ORAI1). STIM1 has been reported to play a critical role in maladaptive
hypertrophy. However, the mechanism whereby STIM1 contributes to hypertrophy and its role in adaptive
hypertrophy (exercise-induced) remain to be elucidated. Recently, we discovered that SOCE and its molecular
machinery are localized at the cell-to-cell contact sites, the intercalated discs (IDs). Based on preliminary results,
we put forth a novel hypothesis that SOCE promotes myocyte longitudinal growth through facilitation of localized
protein synthesis from a dedicated pool of mRNAs at the IDs. Indeed, SOCE in the normal heart may be optimally
tuned to achieve a “Goldilocks zone” of adaptive hypertrophic response, as induced by exercise. In contrast,
pathological dysregulation of SOCE may prove deleterious. Specifically, SOCE over-activity in disease may
underlie maladaptive hypertrophy, thus leading to phenomena such as stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SCM).
In this proposal, we will use cutting-edge cellular physiology and molecular techniques (including super-
resolution microscopy, novel cellular reporter systems) and novel genetic mouse models to test these
hypotheses and determine key cellular micro- and nanodomains, as well as molecular steps involved in SOCE-
driven myocyte growth. We will also examine the possibility of targeting key components of the SOCE machinery
(specifically, STIM1L, the long splice variant of STIM1) that mediate maladaptive hypertrophy. To this end, we
propose the following specific aims: 1) Define the role of SOCE in adaptive and maladaptive hypertrophy. 2)
Define subcellular and molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of hypertrophy by SOCE; and 3) Define
the role and mechanism of SOCE in stress-induced hypertrophic cardiac disease. These studies will yield new
insights into the mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological hypertrophy and provide a foundation for
new mechanism-based therapies for abnormal cardiac structure and function."
10839298,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE C
Efficient and reproducible detection of immune cell states is paramount to our understanding of the immune
responses in the context of health and disease, such as cancer and autoimmunity. Immune function is
highly dependent upon costimulatory signals where their role has become apparent in the study of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes with PD-1/PD-L1 expression, as well as in autoimmune disease particularly with
activation of autoreactive T cells and costimulatory receptor CD226 and its ligand CD155 which is shared
with TIGIT. Achieving a mechanistic understanding by which PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 axes regulate T
cell and myeloid cell function will enable refinement of the therapeutic use and target of these costimulatory
pathways. The Single Cell and Spatial Multi-omics Core (Core C) at Yale University will provide support for novel
transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial profiling of single cells as well as enriched immune cell types across all
three projects of the Program Project Grant. Our core has established systematic pipelines for processing single
cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from low-input samples, from single cells or single nuclei, as well as for spatial
transcriptomics using DBiT-seq, a single cell spatial technology newly developed at Yale which will be used in
both experimental models and in human tissues across the three projects. This core provides capabilities and a
pipeline for the preparation, sequencing and single cell analysis and data integration across species. Our
experimental and computational resource will facilitate (1) the investigations of immunity in mouse models that
are deficient for TIGIT, PD1, or both, (2) the characterization of cells or nuclei or sections human tissues from
patients with multiple sclerosis and glioblastoma, and (3) the single cell, integrative analysis of all data generated
in Projects 1-3. Overall, the outcome will be a better understanding of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory
mechanisms, and its function in regulating inflammasome activation in T cells and myeloid cells in human
diseases and disease models. This may potentially lead to new avenues for therapy for autoimmunity and
cancer."
10839300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
The CD226/TIGIT pathway is a novel co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory pathway that closely parallels the CD28/CTLA-
4 pathway. Similar to CD28 and CTLA-4, CD226 and TIGIT share ligands (CD112 and CD155) and ligand
engagement of CD226 co-stimulates T cell activation whereas engagement of TIGIT inhibits T cell responses.
Over the last few years, TIGIT has emerged as an important co-inhibitory receptor. Although initial experiments
indicated that TIGIT inhibits T cell responses indirectly by promoting a tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells
(DCs), we and others have shown that TIGIT has T cell-intrinsic inhibitory functions. We have now found that
TIGIT is co-expressed with other co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, Tim-3, Lag-3) on CD8+ T cells that exhibit a
dysfunctional/exhausted phenotype in chronic diseases such as cancer and chronic viral infection. In addition to
its role in effector T cells, conditional deletion of TIGIT on various cell types suggests that TIGIT plays a very
critical role in the function of Foxp3+ Tregs both in autoimmunity and cancer. Importantly, we find that TIGIT+
Tregs interact directly with CD155 expressed on tumors to promote stemness/oncogenesis and on DCs to induce
a tolerogenic phenotype. The bi-directional signaling between TIGIT on T cells and CD155 on target cells has
been poorly explored. In this grant cycle we hypothesize that TIGIT, in addition to inhibiting effector T cell
responses, promotes Treg function and affects target cells by inducing inhibitory signal transduction by
CD155, the high affinity ligand for TIGIT, thereby promotes tissue tolerance and tumor growth. To address
this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms by which TIGIT strengthens
Tregs function by interacting with its ligand CD155. The effect of TIGIT signaling into T cells and role on
effector T cells (CD4 and CD8) will be directly explored in both autoimmune and tumor models; 2) To determine
how TIGIT/CD155 signaling into myeloid cells/tumor cells regulates their function in a cell intrinsic
manner. We will specifically determine how TIGIT signals back via CD155 into tumor cells and professional
antigen presenting cells using proteomic and genomic analyses. By undertaking a comprehensive bi-directional
analysis of interactions between TIGIT on T cells and CD155 on target cells (APCs and tumor cells), we will
begin to identify the mechanisms by which the TIGIT-CD155 interaction induces tissue tolerance and promotes
tumor growth."
10839307,"The immunoinhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT play critical roles in regulating tolerance and are key mediators
of T cell dysfunction in cancer. We, along with our collaborators in this PPG, have shown that PD-1:PD-L1
interactions regulate peripheral T cell tolerance and TIGIT has T cell-intrinsic inhibitory effects that mediate
regulatory T (Treg) cell function. Based on our new preliminary data showing PD-1 blockade increases the
frequency of TIGIT+ Treg cells and data of Project 3 showing that TIGIT agonist reversed in vitro defects of Treg
function in MS, we tested if TIGIT agonism could control pathogenic T cells and ameliorate autoimmunity
exacerbated by PD-1 blockade using the EAE model. Remarkably, TIGIT agonist mAb diminished EAE severity
in mice given anti-PD-1 blocking mAb to a greater extent than TIGIT agonism alone. Importantly, TIGIT agonism
combined with PD-1 blockade did not impair efficacy of PD-1 blockade in controlling tumors, suggesting TIGIT
as a potential target for treating immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with PD-1 blockade therapy.
The goal of Project 2 is to determine how interactions between the TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1
pathways control CD4+ Treg and CD4+ FoxP3— T cells, and define the cellular and molecular circuits
underlying these interactions. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that cellular and molecular interactions
between PD-1 and TIGIT control Treg and CD4+ FoxP3—T cells to regulate autoimmunity. We will use novel tools
and approaches developed by PPG investigators, including TIGIT agonist antibodies, TIGIT and PD-1
conditional knockout (KO) mice that restrict deletion to specific T cell types, high-dimensional cytometry, single-
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), spatial transcriptomics and gene perturbation approaches to interrogate
cellular and molecular mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that interactions between CD155 and
PD-L1 on APC and tumors balance Treg and T effector cell functions to regulate tissue inflammation. We will
evaluate functional interactions between CD155 and PD-L1, focusing on their cell-intrinsic functions in DC and
tumor cells, and cell-extrinsic effects on Treg and CD4+ FoxP3— T cells, using CD155 and PD-L1 conditional KO
mice that restrict deletion to DC and tumor cells lacking CD155 and/or PD-L1 or only their cytoplasmic domains,
and similar approaches as in Aim 1. Our results will provide critical insights into unique and overlapping nodes
by which PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 interact to modulate Treg and CD4+FoxP3— cells to regulate T cell
tolerance. Moreover, our results will contribute directly to Projects 1 and 3 by providing insight into bidirectional
interactions between TIGIT and CD155 (Project 1) and functional differences in T cells from patients with MS or
malignant gliomas based on PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 expression and activity (Project 3). Understanding
mechanisms of TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions should enable design of new therapeutic strategies
for spontaneous autoimmune disorders and irAEs seen with cancer immunotherapies. We will benefit from Core
A (admin), Core B (gene perturbation), and Core C (scNuc-Seq and Multi-omics)."
10871842,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal blood cancer characterized by a clonal expansion of precursor blood-
forming cells. Intensive chemotherapy has been the mainstay of AML therapy for decades. Unfortunately, not all
patients are fit enough to receive it and mortality due to relapse despite intensive treatment is common. Recently,
the FDA approved a lower intensity regimen combining a hypomethylating agent, such as azacitidine (aza), with
the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (ven), based on phase 3 randomized data showing an overall survival benefit and
high response rates across AML prognostic subtypes. The success of aza/ven highlights the apoptotic pathway
as an exciting therapeutic target. Venetoclax induces apoptosis by antagonizing the anti-apoptotic function of
BCL2, one of many mitochondrial BH3-domain proteins that regulate the threshold at which an AML blast dies.
This apoptotic threshold, or priming, in viable leukemic blasts can be measured via a functional cell death assay,
called BH3 profiling. I have recently demonstrated that the cell of origin of leukemic transformation influences
apoptotic priming and resultant therapeutic sensitivity via alterations in p53 activity. I am interested in
understanding how AML cell state, whether established by AML genotype or apoptotic priming, can influence
drug sensitivity and clinical outcomes in the context of attenuated p53 function. I hypothesize that BH3 profiling
of AML patient samples can serve as a biomarker to predict treatment response to aza/ven. I also hypothesize
that complex cytogenetic changes – ensuing from mutant TP53-induced genomic instability – promote AML
progression and therapeutic resistance to aza/ven independent of mutant TP53. I believe that this work will
address important biological questions with therapeutic implications:
 1. Can BH3 profiling assays predict treatment response to aza/ven in xenograft mouse models?
 2. Which transcriptional and epigenetic pathways are engaged in AML cells with low apoptotic priming and
 blunted responsiveness to aza/ven?
 3. Is complex karyotype AML in the setting of TP53 loss of function a bystander phenomenon, or does it
 enhance leukemogenicity and/or resistance to therapies such as aza/ven and chemotherapy?
Dr. Sheng Cai, an Assistant Attending at MSKCC, will conduct this study as part of his career development plan,
dedicating 85% of his time to research. Dr. Cai is mentored by Dr. Ross Levine, a world expert in hematologic
malignancies. He is also advised by Drs. Anthony Letai (who developed the BH3 profiling assay), Scott Lowe,

Among the devastating illnesses impacting rural America, few exact the physical, social, psychological, and
economic toll of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in rural America, and the levy is
particularly acute in Kentucky – a state that not only leads the nation in lung cancer incidence and mortality but
is a global epicenter of lung cancer. Despite the prevailing nihilism regarding lung cancer care, lung cancer
survivors are living longer. Innovations in prevention, early detection, and treatment, have created substantial
optimism and opportunities for long-term lung cancer survivorship. These dramatic changes in the lung cancer
care landscape have invigorated the need for quality lung cancer survivorship interventions. The overarching
goal of the Kentucky LEADS Collaborative Lung Cancer Survivorship Care program is to reduce the
burden of lung cancer by offering an innovative survivorship care approach that improves lung cancer
quality of life, overcomes lung cancer stigma, and helps survivors engage with care. Using a novel
precision survivorship approach and developed in collaboration with rural community stakeholders, the
program's foundation incorporates principles of patient-centered care, shared decision making, and
motivational interviewing to build survivor engagement. A large acceptability and feasibility trial conducted in
collaboration with nine lung cancer care facilities in Kentucky with lung cancer survivors (N=140) demonstrated
the acceptability of the intervention among survivors, caregivers, and lung cancer care clinicians. The study
also revealed the feasibility of conducting the proposed study methods in rural cancer care facilities. The
proposed project continues this program of research by conducting a two-group parallel randomized clinical
trial comparing the impact of the Kentucky LEADS Collaborative Lung Cancer Survivorship Care program
(KLCLCSC) among lung cancer survivors (N=300) against an enhanced usual care condition
(bibliotherapy+assessment) on quality of life outcomes. Rural-residing lung cancer survivors will be recruited
from ten oncology care facilities throughout Kentucky. The project's first aim compares the efficacy of the
interventions with regard to lung cancer quality of life among survivors as measured by the FACT-L and other
rigorous assessments of patient engagement, symptom burden, psychosocial well-being, and behavior
change. The project's second aim evaluates the moderating impact of including caregivers as intervention
partners on survivor quality of life outcomes. A third aim evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the KLCLCSC
intervention in comparison to the enhanced usual care condition. Based on highly encouraging pilot data
collected in collaboration with oncology care programs in Kentucky, this research holds credible potential to
establish a new paradigm for addressing the challenges associated with lung cancer and for delivering quality
survivorship care to rural-residing, economically distressed lung cancer survivors."
10892795,"ABSTRACT
Severe traumatic injury and sepsis are acute pro-inflammatory insults that trigger a “genomic and cytokine storm”
by the host innate immune response that can result in multiple organ failure (MOF). Whereas many patients
previously succumbed to early refractory MOF, progressive advancements in resuscitation and organ support
have led to an increasing number of patients surviving to enter a state of chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as
a patient with an extended intensive care unit (ICU) stay and non-resolving organ dysfunction. Currently, as
many as 25% of trauma and 40% of septic patients in the ICU develop CCI. In addition to a prolonged hospital
course, these ICU “survivors” have recurrent infections, are unable to physically rehabilitate, and are frequently
discharged to high-resource care facilities with dismal long-term outcomes. Two clinical manifestations dominate
the course of the CCI phenotype: 1) recurrent nosocomial and post-discharge infections indicative of a state of
chronic immunosuppression, and 2) acute muscle wasting, weakness and physical debilitation indicative of
persistent inflammation. There is an expanding body of evidence that an underlying syndrome of persistent
inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism (PICS) is a key mechanistic driver of CCI. We hypothesize
that PICS is its own unique immunological endotype independent of the index event, and is the shared
mechanistic pathway leading from either trauma or sepsis to the clinical phenotype of CCI. This maladaptive
host response is sustained by the ongoing release of endogenous alarmins (DAMPs) associated with end-organ
injury, as well as microbial products from primary/secondary infections (PAMPs). This failure to return to
immunologic homeostasis also drives the persistent organ dysfunction seen in CCI. Muscle, being both clinically
relevant and understudied, serves as a novel area of study from the standpoint of inflammation-mediated end-
organ injury both as a driver of acute muscle wasting, as well as a potential source of ongoing alarmin production
and release. The goals for our laboratory’s research program over the next five years include the following: 1)
characterize the heterogeneity of the host response after severe trauma and sepsis by identifying distinct
endotypes based on immune trajectory over time, and whether these endotypes are modified by sex, age and
ethnicity/race; 2) determine if the PICS endotype is the common mechanistic pathway after trauma or sepsis to
the clinical development of CCI; and 3) determine whether muscle inflammation is both a component of chronic
end-organ injury, as well as a mediator of systemic inflammation through the systemic release of endogenous
alarmins. The proposed work is novel, innovative and vital. There are currently no therapeutic interventions
other than supportive therapies for the increasingly common condition of CCI after trauma or sepsis. We believe
that only through a complete understanding of the immunological endotype of CCI can effective therapeutic
interventions be designed. Focusing on interactions between host immunity and muscle inflammation is a novel,
under-explored area of research for the long-term management of severe trauma and sepsis."
10838491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary risk factor for prevalent diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration is aging. At the cellular
level, aging manifests as an accumulation of conserved physiological defects that eventually cause functional
decline, disease, and organismal death. Despite an extensive list of age-associated dysfunctions, we have a
limited understanding of how aging becomes a major disease determinant. The traditional method in the field is
to induce genetic modifications in a model organism before the aging process manifests itself, and to
subsequently determine how these alterations affect lifespan. While these studies have been instrumental in
identifying factors that impact longevity and healthspan, they lack the temporal resolution to distinguish the
gene products that directly counteract age-associated damage from those that have indirect effects on lifespan,
merely through delaying cell cycle progression, growth and/or development. The key challenge is the
development of an effective system that allows identification of the underlying mechanisms of aging and
manipulation of identified factors in a controlled manner. My lab has discovered that gametogenesis, the
differentiation program that gives rise to reproductive cells, contains endogenous rejuvenation pathways.
These physiological pathways have the ability to exclude and eliminate both cytoplasmic and nuclear
pathologies that are associated with age. Therefore, mechanistic dissection of this program offers unique
insights into the biology of aging as well as potential therapeutic avenues for age-associated diseases.
 This proposal seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular events
that are associated with meiotic rejuvenation. The experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine how gametes
are able to exclude and subsequently eliminate nuclear and cytoplasmic defects that accumulate with age. The
experiments proposed in Aim 2 will take an orthogonal approach to identify and characterize the complete
complement of meiotic genes that are capable of extending lifespan in vegetative yeast cells, akin to metazoan
somatic cells. Further extension of these studies to C. elegans will identify conserved meiotic genes that can
counteract organellar damage and will determine the effects of activating gametogenesis-specific rejuvenation
pathways on tissue-specific as well as organismal healthspan. The combination of studies described in this
proposal will reveal a mechanistic understanding of how meiotic rejuvenation occurs at the molecular level,
determine which genes improve fitness and lifespan outside of meiosis, and reveal conserved pathways that
can be leveraged to extend healthspan."
10832115,"Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanisms
by which PM induces pervasive multi-organ injury are still under investigation, evidence strongly implicates
chronic inflammation as a primary driver of pathology. Whether exposure to fine PM (PM2.5) specifically impairs
the endogenous pathways that promote the resolution of inflammation is not known. Therefore, the long-term
goal of this project is to determine how exposure to PM impacts the resolution of inflammation and whether this
contributes to PM exposure-exacerbated atherosclerosis. In work in progress, we discovered that in mice
exposed to concentrated PM (PM2.5) for 30 days circulating erythrocytes expressed markers of premature aging
and oxidative damage. In the spleens of these mice there was an expansion of the population of cells responsible
for erythrocyte disposal, red pulp macrophages, while pathways related to erythrocyte turnover, heme
metabolism, and iron cycling were upregulated. Additionally, we found that several factors related to
hematopoiesis were induced in the tissue. These alterations were accompanied by a marked decrease in the
abundance of specialized lipid mediators that promote resolution (SPMs) and their receptors. The changes in
spleen are particularly critical because the spleen plays a central role in regulating immune response dynamics.
It houses an important and distinct reservoir of monocytes, which can be rapidly mobilized and deployed in
response to various insults. In addition to coordinating immune function, the spleen acts as a filter to remove
senescent and damaged erythrocytes. Though patients survive following splenectomy, they are more likely to
contract serious and life-threatening infections and have heightened risk of developing hematological
malignancies and coronary artery disease among other disorders. Our preliminary studies suggest that exposure
to PM2.5 may disrupt splenic homeostasis with targeted impacts on red pulp macrophages. As macrophages are
the critical facilitators of erythrophagocytosis, maintenance of the splenic hematopoietic niche, and SPM actions,
our central hypothesis is that PM2.5 exposure increases splenic macrophage erythrophagocytosis, which
suppresses SPM production and permits local myelopoiesis, thereby enhancing monocyte egress and
exacerbating vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we will examine the effects of PM2.5 exposure on
splenic macrophages, determine the impact of PM2.5 exposure on the splenic hematopoietic niche and delineate
the contribution of splenic myelopoiesis to PM2.5-exacerbated atherosclerosis. This project will elucidate the
effects of PM on the resolution of inflammation and will provide a new mechanism by which exposure to PM
establishes a state of chronic, non-resolving inflammation that affects multiple organs and processes."

The long-term goals of this joint project are to understand the mechanisms, role and significance of electrical
control of insulin secretion in hyperinsulinism and diabetes. Previous efforts demonstrated the central role of
the KATP channel in electrical activity of the pancreatic beta-cell and revealed how defective channel activity
can have profound effects on insulin secretion, and cause hyperinsulinism and neonatal diabetes. This
understanding now underlies the use of KATP channel activators and inhibitors, respectively, as first line
therapies. However, a paradoxical, essentially unexplained, crossover to glucose-insufficiency, or outright
diabetes, is seen in both animals and humans with hyperinsulinism. In Type 2 diabetes, a parallel crossover from
initial hypersecretion to secretory failure, may reflect a similar progression. Proposed studies will utilize novel
inducible KATP channel knockdown models and models of type 2 diabetes to comprehensively probe the
mechanistic basis of this reversal, and thereby improve understanding and management of HI and other forms of
long-term -cell secretory failure."

Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (AlloP) strongly potentiate GABAA receptor function, driving the view
that these effects mediate psychoactive effects of neuroactive steroids (NAS). The rapid antidepressant
actions of AlloP seem to belie a solely GABAergic mechanism. Understanding the additional mechanisms of
NAS will allow evolution of the next generation of treatments. We seek to both understand mechanisms by
which AlloP promotes therapeutic benefit and to improve on these benefits with NAS that possess additional
and/or alternative mechanisms. The Center leverages a unique set of NAS analogues. This project's first Aim
is to evaluate the impact of these analogues on underappreciated ion channel targets of NAS: voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors. This aim will work in concert with Project 1 to identify sites of action on
NMDA receptors. In addition, this aim will re-evaluate the GABAA receptor subtype selectivity of NAS in native
cells. The second aim of the study is to limit NAS actions to plasma membrane receptors using novel tethered
ligand approaches. This will reveal NAS effects in the absence of intracellular targets, which we will explore in
Aim 3 with evaluation of compounds' activity on neuroinflammatory cytokines and autophagy pathways. This
aim follows up on preliminary data that suggests that NAS unnatural enantiomers influence the function of
these intracellular targets, and project 1 will explore potential relevant protein targets that mediate these
effects. A final aim is to evaluate the impact of various NAS analogues on functional microcircuitry of ex vivo
brain circuits. This project will identify the most interesting set of compounds for evaluation in project 3, which
explores in vivo physiology and circuitry."

 Osteoarthritis (OA), common in the knee, is a prevalent disease that incurs enormous burden. The
pathogenesis of OA remains largely unclear, and effective disease modifying therapies are lacking. Recent
animal studies show that abnormal bone resorption and microstructural adaptations have been linked to OA
progression. Few studies have comprehensively quantified subchondral bone microstructure in the human
knee OA, particularly at the early stage and none have looked at cartilage in conjunction. In vivo quantification
methods of subchondral bone microstructure in the knee are lacking, making it difficult to accurately and
longitudinally assess microstructural changes in human knee OA development. We propose two Specific
Aims to address basic and clinical science knowledge gaps in knee OA. In Specific Aim 1, we will use
Individual Trabecula Segmentation (ITS), an advanced microstructural analysis technique, based on the
second generation high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (2G HR-pQCT) as a novel
evaluation tool for human knee OA and also perform comprehensive quantification of cartilage using MRI. In
Specific Aim 2, we will use the same methods for longitudinal analysis of OA patients. Findings from the study
may provide clinical insights into how a subset of this group with mild/moderate or no knee OA progresses.
Hypothesis 1: ITS analysis of in vivo 2G HR-pQCT knee scans detects microstructural differences in
subchondral trabecular plates and rods that differ by Kellgren and Lawrence KOA grades (0-IV) and are more
severe in women than men.

predictors of progression to KL Grade III-IV."
10793587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major hospital-acquired illness that causes severe morbidity and
mortality. In 2011, the CDC reported that there were 453,000 cases of CDI in the United States, with 29,000
deaths. The emergence of epidemic strains, notably NAP1/027, has considerably increased the prevalence and
severity of the disease. This clade of C. difficile developed resistance to both metronidazole (a CDI medication)
and fluoroquinolones (commonly used antibiotics). As a result, two selection forces drove the worldwide spread
of epidemic strains. Now the strains are increasingly becoming resistant to vancomycin, the antibiotic of choice
for CDI. Vancomycin is an important first-line treatment for CDI, and increased prescribing of this antibiotic has
raised selection pressures. Vancomycin resistance is increasingly more prevalent in epidemic strains, especially
NAP1/027, and our study revealed that these strains are spreading internationally. This is concerning since this
lineage is associated with severe illness and rapid transmission in hospitals. Preliminary findings indicate that
patients infected with vancomycin resistant strains are twice as likely to have poor clinical outcomes. Genome
analyses indicate these strains are developing primary and secondary resistance mechanisms that allow them
to persist in drug concentrations predicted to occur in the colons of patients. Critical questions remain to
understand this emerging form of C. difficile, which address in three cohesive aims. In one goal, we perform
clinical studies and epidemiological research using biobanked samples and patient metadata to understand how
these emerging pathogens affect clinical outcomes and disease characteristics, during vancomycin therapy. It is
supported by clinical reflective in vitro and animas models of CDI. In the second goal, the strains will be
genetically characterized to delineate genetic variations that promote treatment failures in patients. These
genetic signatures will be molecularly validated in the lab and used in population-based analyses of public
genomes to understand global patterns of resistance among patient isolates. Lastly, given there are few
treatment options for CDI, other antibiotic strategies will be investigated to provide additional coverage of
organisms prone to vancomycin to fail. The outcome of this research will be delineation of genetic variations that
evolve in C. difficile that cause therapeutic failure. This will lay the foundation for molecular and genomic
diagnostics to rapidly detect these strains to improve prescribing approaches for CDI patients. Public health.
This study has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of CDI, a disease that imposes a major
public health and economic burden in the United States."
10868731,"The human body is host to trillions of commensal bacteria, archaea, and fungi whose total gene content is
estimated to be over 2000 times more than that of their human hosts, most of which reside in the intestinal tract
and colonize many other body sites, notably skin and mouth. The Human Microbiome Project, launched in 2007
by the NIH, has been instrumental in driving the development of multi-omic tools to characterize microbiomes,
however the vast majority of studies have focused on studying the microbiome of the large intestine. Moreover,
these studies have served to simply sequence these communities, with little effort put forth to cultivate and
functionally characterize them or their individual bacterial strains. Therefore, cultivation and characterization of
microbial communities at sites less well studied than the gut is a key, unmet need in the field of microbiome
research. The ocular surface was initially thought to be sterile due to difficulty in obtaining viable microbes using
traditional culture-based techniques, not to mention the potent anti-microbial defenses present in tears. Recent
work has indicated the ocular surface is not sterile but contains a low biomass microbial community, which
suggests these microbes may play a role in ocular health. However, because most studies characterizing the
eye microbiome have focused solely on 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing to date, the presence of a
bona fide ocular microbiome is still poorly understood. In response to this U24 RFA, we propose to better define
the breadth of microbes and microbial communities that populate the ocular surface through a combination of
targeted cultivation and metagenomic sequencing approaches. Once individual microbes and communities have
been cultivated and cataloged, we will functionally assess the impact of these microbes on various aspects of
human eye biology. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in ocular
biology, immunology, microbial ecology and physiology, metagenomics and microbial cultivation to generate
robust resources of microbial strains, genomes, metagenomes, and functional repertoire for the eye and
microbiome communities. The following goals to be pursued in generating these resources are: Goal 1:
Cultivation and characterization of the ocular surface microbiome. We will use a combination of targeted
cultivation, full length (FL) 16S rDNA sequencing, and whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics to
characterize the microbiomes associated with the ocular surface including the conjunctiva, tears, and periocular
skin. Goal 2: Functional characterization of microbes and microbial community interactions with the eye.
To understand how eye associated microbes can impact eye health and physiology, we will combine cultivation
of individual microbes from the ocular surface with primary human cell culture assays to monitor the functional
impact of microbes on the eye. Our ultimate goal by the end of this proposal period is to have a robust set of
well-characterized ocular surface microbes with which the scientific community can now begin functional
characterization of eye/microbiome interactions."
10842383,"ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent risk factor for death that affects 10-15% of hospitalized patients
and more than 50% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The most frequent cause of AKI is sepsis,
which affects 48 million people worldwide every year. Importantly, the 6-8-fold increase in the risk of death that
AKI carries in sepsis may be reversible because patients with sepsis who recover from AKI have similar 1- and
3-year mortality as those without AKI. These data agree with evidence showing that the development of AKI
carries far-reaching consequences like remote organ dysfunction and an increased susceptibility to infection.
These data suggest that AKI may be in the causal pathway to death from sepsis and that efforts to reverse AKI
may improve the survival in patients with sepsis. However, there are no specific therapies to reverse or prevent
the development of AKI during sepsis. We have recently demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), a ubiquitous master regulator of cell metabolism and energy balance, is critical to protect the kidney
from injury and enhance survival during experimental sepsis. We and others have shown that pharmacologic
activation of AMPK protects from AKI and improves survival, while inhibition increases kidney injury and death.
Interestingly, metformin, the recommended first-line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a
known AMPK activator. Based on this, we have demonstrated that treatment with metformin decreases mortal-
ity during experimental sepsis. Multiple observational human studies also support this idea. Two recent meta-
analyses concluded that exposure to metformin was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. We con-
ducted the largest propensity-score matched retrospective study to date and demonstrated that metformin is
associated with a decrease in the odds of moderate-severe AKI and death at 90-days, as well as with an in-
creased odds of recovery from AKI. Despite this evidence, several gaps in knowledge remain. First, it is un-
clear if the protective effect of metformin is due to confounders. Second, it is unknown if the results of available
studies are generalizable to non-diabetic patients. Third, despite a track record of over 60 years of use in dia-
betic patients, safety has not been established in patients with septic shock. This proposal aims to conduct a
randomized, placebo-controlled, feasibility study to establish the safety and feasibility of the use of oral metfor-
min to prevent the development of sepsis-induced AKI, and to inform a future full-scale efficacy trial. Our over-
arching hypothesis is that, in treatment of patients with sepsis, metformin is safe and effective in reducing sep-
sis-induced elevations in AKI biomarkers. We will determine the safety of the use of metformin to treat adult
patients with sepsis, and we will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of oral metformin (Aim 1), the feasibility
of implementing this therapy (Aim 2), and estimate the heterogeneity of the effect of metformin on markers of
kidney injury/stress and on circulating platelet mitochondrial function (Aim 3). This study is the first critical step
to inform the design of a future, full-scale efficacy RCT."
10836580,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ability to measure extremely low levels of biomolecules accurately and rapidly is essential for diagnosing
and monitoring many diseases. While sufficient for certain biomarkers, the sensitivities of most existing
diagnostic systems are inadequate for measuring many protein biomarkers that exist in easily accessible
biofluids at concentrations below the picomolar range. In this application, we propose to engineer and refine a
new ultrasensitive single molecule protein analysis platform that will be able to routinely measure attomolar
protein concentrations, which we call Molecular On-bead Signal Amplification for Individual Counting (MOSAIC).
MOSAIC transforms single molecule measurements into a simplified assay format via on-bead signal
localization, which has the potential to be integrated into a point of care (POC) device. In MOSAIC, a non-
diffusible signal is generated on each bead carrying a target molecule, creating an on-bead signal that remains
attached for prolonged periods of time, thereby enabling alternative detection schemes to be employed that do
not require bead confinement into microwells or droplets to localize signals. A key challenge to be addressed in
the proposed work will be to ensure that this MOSAIC platform can consistently outperform current ultrasensitive
protein detection technologies in sensitivity by one to two orders of magnitude across many protein analytes,
which in turn lays the foundation for future work in translating this enhanced analytical sensitivity to improved
clinical sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic applications. In Aims 1 and 2, we will optimize signal generation
and readout methods for MOSAIC and expand its multiplexing capabilities. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the
diagnostic utility of MOSAIC in a proof-of-principle clinical application to detect very low abundance
Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in urine as a potential triage test for tuberculosis. The resulting biosensing
technology will provide an ultrasensitive diagnostic platform that will open up protein analysis to previously
inaccessible biomarkers and also be readily and affordably utilized across both research and clinical laboratories
using common laboratory instruments."

Cancer cell mitochondria switch their metabolic phenotypes to meet the challenges of high-energy demand and
macromolecular synthesis. Acute dependence of tumors on oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling support their
rapid proliferation, however, direct relevance of the kinase activity for mitochondria to support these high-energy
processes remains obscure. Serendipitously, we uncovered that a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1,
phosphorylates ATP synthase F1 α-subunit (ATP5F1a) at Tyr243 and Tyr246 (Tyr200 & 203 in mature protein,
respectively) that increased ATP synthase activity specifically in the cancer cells. Mechanistically, ATP5F1a-
phosphorylation not only excluded its binding to its physiological inhibitor, ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), but
also created a supporting structure that extended from the bound non-catalytic nucleotide to the surface,
reducing the flexibility and thereby increasing the stability of the enzyme. A new class of ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9b
reversed this process, inducing mitophagy and mitigating tumor growth. Consistently, a marked increase in
ATP5F1a-phosphorylations was observed as normal prostate progressed to the malignant stage. Overall, these
data provide the molecular evidence for cancer cell `mitochondrial addiction’ to Tyr-kinase indulgence, and
reveals (R)-9b as a ‘mitocan’ that compromises the unique metabolic needs of cancer cells.
Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable malignancy with limited treatment options and
is a significant cause of deaths in men worldwide (15). Limited efficacy and rapid development of resistance for
Enzalutamide and Abiraterone, AR antagonist treatment have established a new paradigm-to achieve realistic
remission, other cancer specific pathways, including metabolic must be compromised. This proposal is directed
towards detailed characterization of mitochondrial metabolism modulatory properties of ACK1/ATP5F1a
signaling and examine ability of (R)-9b to overcome Enzalutamide and abiraterone-resistant CRPCs. The
specific aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1. Examine the mechanism by which ATP5F1a-phosphorylation regulates its activity in prostate
cancer
Specific Aim 2. Explore the role of ACK1/ATP5F1a signaling in prostate cancer models
Specific Aim 3. Detail in vivo characterization of ACK1/ATP5F1a signaling in enzalutamide and abiraterone-
resistance in mouse models of prostate cancer and patient derived xenografts (PDXs)"
10906850,"Project Summary/Abstract: Amphetamines (AMPHs) are psychostimulants commonly used for the treatment
of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. attention deficit disorders). They are also abused, with devastating outcomes.
The abuse potential of AMPHs is associated with their ability to cause mobilization of cytoplasmic dopamine
(DA), which leads to an increase in extracellular DA levels. This increase is mediated by the reversal of the DA
transporter (DAT) function, which causes non-vesicular DA release, here defined as DA efflux. Notably,
inhibition of DA efflux reduces both the ability of AMPH to increase motor activity and AMPH preference8-10.
 Imbalances in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) have been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of
substance use disorders11. In addition, psychostimulant abuse promotes dysbiosis12-15. Therefore, it is possible
that changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites may not only be a consequence of substance use
disorders, but may play a role in mediating the behavioral responses to drugs of abuse11.
 Microbial products, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are thought to play a fundamental role in
regulating the gut-brain axis16. Among SCFAs, butyrate is known to cross the BBB and directly act on neurons
and glial cells17. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is an anaerobic, filamentous, gram-negative bacterial
species that secretes butyrate18, the growth of which is stimulated by AMPH abuse13-15.
 Our data demonstrate that in germ-free (gnotobiotic) Drosophila, colonization with F. nucleatum enhances
AMPH-induced DA effluxes (recorded in isolated fly brains), as well as AMPH behaviors. This potentiation of
AMPH actions by F. nucleatum is paralleled by oral administration of butyrate. To understand, mechanistically,
how F. nucleatum promotes AMPH actions, it is important to consider that changes in DAT expression regulate
both AMPH-induced DA efflux and psychomotor actions19. Also, butyrate is a potent inhibitor of histone
deacetylases (HDACs)20-22; inhibition of HDACs robustly increases expression of both DAT mRNA and
proteins21-23.
 Our hypothesis is that F. nucleatum enhances AMPH actions by elevating DAT expression. This is mediated
by secretion of butyrate, HDAC inhibition, and enhanced Drosophila DAT (dDAT) promotor acetylation. We will
test this hypothesis through the following specific aims:
S.A. #1. To determine how F. nucleatum regulates dDAT expression.
S.A. #2. To test, mechanistically, how F. nucleatum increases AMPH-induced DA efflux.
The experiments of S.A. #1-2 will be performed in isolated Drosophila brains, a model our laboratory developed
to study AMPH actions ex vivo. Furthermore, using adult Drosophila, we will be able to translate the molecular
discoveries of S.A. #1-2 to specific AMPH behavioral phenotypes. Thus, S.A. #3 focuses on behavior.
S.A. #3. To define how F. nucleatum enhances AMPH behaviors."
10880577,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the United States. Among the
various psychopathologies, anxiety and depression symptoms and syndromes are the most prevalent psychiatric
conditions in the general population and are remarkably comorbid with smoking. Moreover, affective-vulnerable
smokers often are more nicotine dependent, smoke more to manage negative mood states, and expect smoking
to have greater positive effects on their mood compared to smokers without such affect vulnerability.
 An integrative approach to address negative affect symptoms and disorders associated with smoking is to
focus on transdiagnostic processes that underpin both affective psychopathology and smoking. Anxiety
sensitivity (AS), or the fear of anxiety and aversive internal sensations, is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor
for the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders and other emotional disorders. AS is associated with an
increased risk of anxiety and mood psychopathology and implicated in several aspects of smoking maintenance
and relapse, including nicotine withdrawal and craving and greater odds of early lapse and relapse.
 Our treatment development work (i.e., phases I and II) supports high-intensity exercise as an intervention
strategy for smokers with high AS. High-intensity exercise reduces AS as well as nicotine withdrawal and craving,
depression, and anxiety, all of which have shown to predict cessation failure. We have shown that a 15-week
intervention that combines high-intensity exercise with standard smoking cessation treatment (Smoking
Treatment Enhancement Program [STEP]) yields significantly higher abstinence rates relative an intervention
that combines wellness education with standard smoking cessation treatment. We have also shown that STEP
can be adapted for delivery in a community-based setting involving the YMCA and the Quitline; abstinence rates
among participants receiving STEP were double those among participants assigned to the control intervention.
 The proposed study aims to build upon this research by conducting a phase III study. First, we will examine
whether the efficacy of the community-based version of STEP will generalize across non-Latinx White, Black
and Latinx smokers. This aim is informed by the observations that (1) racial/ethnic minorities are less apt to seek
and receive (successful) evidenced-based care for smoking cessation and are underrepresented in efficacy
research; and (2) Black and Latinx smokers might benefit from specific focus on increasing the ability to
adaptively respond to interoceptive stress as targeted in STEP. Second, we will test putative mechanisms of
actions and aim to identify moderators of efficacy. Third, we will aim to identify opportunities to improve the reach,
effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of STEP across YMCA’s using an implementation
framework (RE-AIM) and qualitative process evaluation. These aims will be tested by conducting a large
randomized clinical trial comparing STEP to a control intervention across several YMCA branches among a
racially/ethnically diverse sample of smokers."
10851903,"The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is designed to study the links between social, cognitive, mental, and physical health trajectories among older adults, many of whom will acquire Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Started in 2005–06, NSHAP collects a rich and unique set of data at 5-year intervals, including detailed information on social networks, cognitive function, mental health, clinical diagnoses of physical health and AD/ADRD, medications, biological samples, sensory function, and accelerometer-measured daily activity and sleep. Round 4 (R4) is currently underway and when completed in 2023, will provide updated data on ~3,500 respondents aged 60–100.
 While NSHAP’s 5-year cadence may be adequate at younger ages, this is less true at older ages, especially among those who are experiencing health declines including onset of AD/ADRD and are thus at higher risk of rapid changes and mortality. We propose to augment NSHAP’s study design so researchers can study this part of the lifecourse in more detail. Specifically, we shall transition a subset of NSHAP respondents identified using data through R4 as being at greater risk of mortality to being followed-up every two years. A smaller, age-matched control group at low risk of mortality will also be included and all Black and Hispanic respondents will be included regardless of age or health status. To maximize the completeness and analytic value of information from respondents in increasingly poor physical and cognitive health, including Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias, we shall administer interviews with targeted measures to capture recent changes in their social, cognitive, and physical health and well-being, and to obtain spousal, proxy, and informant interviews when needed to enhance respondent data. Further, we propose to add new measures that are culturally attuned to the unique experiences of Black and Hispanic populations. 
 This NSHAP subset and a two-year periodicity will allow the study of the antecedents and consequences of changes in key dimensions of health as they occur more rapidly in people’s final years, including AD/ADRD, daily activity, sleep, frailty, polypharmacy, and social well-being, for (1) those at high risk of mortality as compared to those at lower risk, and for (2) those at high risk who die during the period compared to those at high risk who do not die. This strategy differs from that often taken by studies of end of life in which a group of deceased individuals is studied retrospectively, thereby yielding conclusions conditional on having died.12 In contrast, our approach will allow researchers to make conclusions about the future for those currently alive, including onset and course of AD/ADRD, as well as permit us to refine our mortality prediction models. 
 We test the overarching hypothesis that social well-being will modulate mortality risk. Throughout, we test competing hypotheses in which changes in social well-being precede changes in other health indicators such as Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias that predispose toward early mortality."
10863955,"Summary
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is an overwhelming medical condition at any age, but
ADRD in younger adulthood is particularly devastating, affecting quality of life and independence of individuals
in their prime years. Early onset ADRD (EOD) is defined as an ADRD diagnosis before age 65. While it is
commonly perceived that EOD occurs primarily as a rare genetic syndrome, the known genetic variants account
for less than 5% of cases. Despite the distressing course and unclear nature of the disease in the majority of
cases, EOD is widely understudied. Current data on the prevalence and incidence of EOD seem to
underestimate the magnitude of the problem and there is no information available regarding predisposing and/or
protective factors for EOD.
Using the infrastructure of an international Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP), we propose a prospective
study of EOD development which comprises individuals from five large multi-ethnic population-based cohort
studies (ARIC, MESA, FHS, Whitehall II and, UK Biobank). This study provides the opportunity to (1) refine
estimates of incident EOD, (2) investigate the role of cardiovascular, lifestyle and behavioral risk factors in the
onset of EOD and (3) study whether a favorable midlife risk profile in the presence of genetic predisposition
delays EOD age of onset. This evaluation will be the first study to pool multiple international population-based
cohorts to prospectively study ADRD before the age of 65 in young and middle-aged adults. The current notion
that EOD is merely driven by genetic syndromes has shadowed efforts to identify distinct predisposing and/or
protective factors for EOD and targeting vulnerable populations for early detection and prevention. The findings
will shed much needed light on the vulnerability and unique risk factors for EOD and may lead to development
of more effective targets for prevention to delay onset and progression of disease. EOD is relatively rare and
thus primordial and primary prevention may be more efficient than screening and secondary or tertiary
prevention. Our data on EOD risk factors will strengthen targeted intervention strategies with focus on primordial
and primary prevention."
10832056,"SUMMARY
Dysregulation of inhibitory G protein-dependent signaling, including signaling controlled by the GABAB receptor
(GABABR), is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases. In the hippocampus (HPC), GABABR
exerts much of its inhibitory influence by activating G protein-gated Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels
and by inhibiting Adenylyl Cyclase (AC). We have shown that GABABR-GIRK signaling in the HPC is modulated
by Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins of the R7 sub-family, which sharpen the timing and dampen
the sensitivity of this signaling pathway. The R7 RGS sub-family includes RGS6 and RGS7, which form stable
complexes with G5. Genetic ablation of RGS7/G5 complexes in mice profoundly alters GABABR-GIRK
signaling, disrupting synaptic plasticity and HPC-dependent behaviors. R7 RGS/G5 complexes can also
associate with adaptor proteins, including the small palmitoylated protein R7BP and an orphan Class C GPCR
(GPR158). Our recent work suggests the intriguing prospect that discrete R7 RGS/G5 complexes, together with
R7BP and GPR158, play an essential role in the selective routing of GABABR signals to GIRK channels or AC.
These findings fuel our central hypothesis that R7 RGS/G5 complexes and their adaptors orchestrate the
assembly of inhibitory ""signalosomes” – distinct physical and/or functional arrays of receptors, G proteins, RGS
and related proteins, and effectors – to ensure the dedicated and selective regulation of effector enzymes and
ion channels by GABABR. To test this innovative hypothesis, we propose a multi-disciplinary program with two
AIMs: 1) Identify mechanisms mediating GABABR-effector signaling dynamics and compartmentalization. We
will employ loss- and gain-of-function/rescue genetic manipulations in HPC pyramidal neurons, along with
electrophysiological and real-time optical assessments of GABABR-effector signaling, to test the prospect that
discrete R7 RGS/G5 complexes and their adaptors, working in concert with their inhibitory G protein substrates,
orchestrate the assembly of distinct and dedicated GABABR-GIRK and GABABR-AC signalosomes. 2)
Interrogate the organization of the GABABR-GIRK signalosome. Leveraging insights derived from our recent
crystal structure of RGS7/G5 and associated predictive modeling, we will use cell-based biochemical and
optical reporter assays, as well as orthogonal biochemical reconstitution approaches, to test hypotheses related
to interactions and interfaces among GABABR-GIRK signalosome elements. Structural insights into GABABR-
GIRK signalosome assembly will then be exploited to probe the functional relevance of specific interactions.
Summary: Our efforts will reveal whether R7 RGS/G5 complexes and adaptors orchestrate selective signaling
between GABABR and its effectors. This project will yield new mechanistic insights into the functional and
physical compartmentalization of GABABR-effector signaling, knowledge that can be used to design novel
therapeutic interventions for neurological disorders and diseases characterized by aberrant GABABR-dependent
signaling."
10828855,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is present in 25-30% of stroke patients, and it is difficult to
predict at the time of stroke who those patients will be. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease and
the NHLBI-NINDS VCID Workshop called for increased research on VCID prediction, especially in underserved
populations. The proposed research will identify predictors of cognitive recovery in rural, underserved patients
after mechanical thrombectomy for emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) stroke. These predictors will target
patients that would benefit from intensive rehabilitation. Our novel biologic sample registry was used to identify
proteins in systemic blood samples taken during thrombectomy as independent predictors of cognitive
performance at post-stroke discharge and 90-day follow-up. The hypothesis is that these proteins will provide
incremental predictive validity for cognitive impairment including dementia, over and above clinical
characteristics, social determinants of health, and traditional ADRD plasma biomarkers. The proposed study will
prospectively enroll 225 patients collecting systemic arterial blood at the time of thrombectomy and analyze
protein expression. Using a retention strategy tailored to underserved rural participants, neurocognitive test data
and venous blood samples for longitudinal protein expression will be collected from 3 months to 2 years post-
thrombectomy. The study site, located in the US Stroke Belt with some of the most medically underserved rural
counties in the nation, will contribute to the NIH priority focus on health disparities. Specific Aim 1: Test the
hypothesis that increased patient home county rurality predicts worse cognitive outcomes post-stroke,
both acutely and chronically. Generalized estimating equation models will test the main effect of home county
rurality and other social determinants of health on cognitive status (normal, cognitive impairment no dementia,
dementia), the main effect of time on cognitive performance across time points, and the interaction of rurality and
time on cognitive status across time points. Associations among rurality, comorbidities, and time-of-thrombectomy
blood protein expression will be auxiliary analyses. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that ADRD
biomarkers in systemic blood at time of thrombectomy are biomarkers for acute post-stroke cognitive
impairment and chronic VCID two years later. Blood samples will be assessed for known proteomic
biomarkers for cognition at the UKY Biomarker Center. Specific Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that novel
biomarkers in systemic blood at time of thrombectomy predict chronic VCID including dementia, over
and above the effects of ADRD markers. Proteomic analysis will be conducted on time-of-thrombectomy blood
samples to measure the expression of inflammatory-related proteins. Hierarchical generalized estimating
equation models will assess the incremental improvement in prediction of cognitive status over time added by
these addition markers. Analyses will use LASSO methods and split-sample cross-validation to create a
predictive model based on both ADRD and novel biomarkers that predict cognitive outcomes."
10818577,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The airway system is composed of asymmetric dichotomously branching tubes lined with respiratory epithelium
that form a barrier at the interface with the environment. The airways carry a simple function of conducting
oxygen rich air to the alveolar space where gas exchange with the blood occur. By doing that, pathogens and
particles enter the lungs. Mucociliary transport is a host defense mechanism that protect the lungs from
invading organisms. Defects in mucociliary transport contributes to many airway diseases such as asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary
dyskinesia. We developed limited understanding of the mechanism of MCT in large airways by investigating
the role of submucosal gland secretions. We found that mucus strands secreted by submucosal glands are
critical to initiate movement of large particles in large airways. We also found that in CF airways, due to loss of
CFTR-mediated anion secretion, mucus strands are abnormally elastic. They fail to detach from submucosal
gland duct opening and often recoil backward while transporting on the airway surface. Small airways
constitute the majority of the surface airway of the lungs and it is suggested that may contribute to some of the
abnormalities seen in several airway diseases. The hypothesis that mucociliary defects in small airways
contribute to CF airway disease pathogenesis has largely remained untested. In addition, the characteristic
features of MCT in small airways has remained poorly understood. To understand mucociliary transport in the
small airways, we developed a positron emission based mucociliary transport assay with high spatial and
temporal resolution not achieved before. We used CF airway disease as a disease model of impaired
mucociliary transport. To realize our overarching goal of understanding the mechanism of mucociliary
transport in both small and large airways, we will test hypotheses in the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. What
is the mechanism of metachronal motion in vivo? Does disruption of mucus viscoelastic properties alter
metachronal motion? Does loss of submucosal gland mucus secretion affect metachronal motion? Is
metachronal motion impaired in CF airways? Aim 2. Is mucociliary clearance defective in CF small
airways? Does loss of CFTR cause an MCC defect? Will HEMT correct it? Will an inhaled mucolytic (TCEP)
correct it? Aim 3. Is early intervention (at birth) sufficient to prevent/delay CF airway disease? Does
HEMT revert CF airway disease back to normal in young piglets? Are mucolytics effective as a bridge therapy
until HEMT are initiated? The results are very important in understanding the mechanism of MCT and how
MCT is controlled, and ultimately identify desperately new targets for lung diseases. The results will also guide
development of newer therapeutics or combination of therapeutics."
10864813,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite 50+ years of dissecting the pathways of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there are
still no drugs which improve its mortality. From a pharmacology perspective, this lack of clinical trial success
falls into 2 major buckets: poor drug delivery to the alveoli and no platform technology to easily design a drug
for a given target protein. Here, we aim to solve these problems with a single nanotechnology. We began by
developing nano-scale drug carriers (nanocarriers) that can massively concentrate drugs in the alveoli,
~300-fold, after IV injection. These nanocarriers are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that are conjugated to targeting
moieties that either direct the LNPs to alveolar endothelial cells (via an anti-PECAM antibody on the LNP
surface), or to alveolar marginated leukocytes (via our recently developed NAP-tag). While we have for years
used these nanocarriers to deliver small molecule drugs, that class of cargo drugs had few molecules that
impacted ARDS-related pathways, and the drugs were difficult to load into LNPs. Therefore, here we will for
the first time deliver inside our alveolar-targeted LNPs a new class of drugs that can target virtually any
pathway: modified mRNA. Modified mRNA-LNPs drive the expression of encoded proteins for ~48 hours per
dose. In this proposal, we will combine our alveolar-targeting & mRNA technologies to treat two of the biggest
pathological processes of early-mid ARDS: alveolar capillary leak (Aim 1, targeting endothelial cells) and
leukocyte infiltration (Aim 2, targeting alveolar marginated leukocytes). For each of these 2 ARDS-related
disease processes, we will deliver mRNAs that encode either a secreted molecule (Ang1 or IL-10) or an
intracellular molecule (VE-cadherin or IkB), to compare how these different protein classes function with this
technology. Finally, we will test these in two ARDS-like mouse models of ARDS (Aims 1 & 2), and in ex vivo
human lungs (Aim 3). The platform technology developed here may directly produce an ARDS therapeutic,
and may also be extended later to probe ARDS pathophysiology, and treat other alveolar diseases."

Treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by common relapse, heterogeneity in findings, and
many diverse interventions which show modest efficacy but fail to out perform each other. Research aiming to
explain the existing heterogeneity has found many significant moderators of treatment effects but few of these
have effect sizes large enough to indicate that they should be used in clinical practice for targeting treatments.
New personalized medicine methods which use machine learning algorithms to create predictions of
responses to AUD treatment which take into account multiple predictors show early promise. This research
This research uses data from 11 randomized clinical trials, 6 of behavioral relapse prevention programs and 5
of pharmacological interventions to reduce heavy drinking, to develop and cross validate individual predictions
of treatment effects on heavy drinking. We will also test the significance of individual differences for each
intervention and provide predictive intervals for individuals describing their expected response to different
interventions. The study also aims to test new approaches for combining data across multiple trials and for
improving precision of predictions in order to make the use of the predicted individual treatment effects (PITEs)
framework more useful in clinical practice.
At the end of this study there will be published algorithms for comparing predictions of treatment effects for
new individuals across multiple treatments, predictive intervals for those effects, and an assessment of internal
and, where possible, external validation of those predictions. The work emphasizes replicability of results
through cross-validation (which will itself be tested with simulations), a priori specification of predictive methods
and covariates, and use of an expert panel to make theory and literature informed decisions. This research is
designed to make personalized medicine for treatment of AUD usable in clinical practice through its integration
of theory, clinical experience brought by the clinical advisory board, and clear communication of results to a
clinical audience."
10827967,"Abstract
Interstitial cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a serious and painful condition of unknown etiology that
affects 6% of women in the United States. The major clinical symptoms of IC/BPS are pain on bladder filling and
increased urinary urgency and frequency. The majority of IC/BPS patients (90%) also suffer from comorbid
anxiety and/or depression, contributing to a poor quality of life. Current available treatments for IC/BPS are
largely ineffective, providing only mild symptomatic relief. Given the prevalence of this debilitating disease and
the lack of effective treatments, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms that
contribute IC/BPS and those that mediate the high incidence of comorbid anxiety and depression. We previously
reported that IC/BPS patients show referred abdominal hyperalgesia, a clear sign of central sensitization. In the
previous funding period, we used the single nucleus RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and in situ
hybridization and identified two populations of CeA neurons that are activated in cystitis and appear to play
opposing roles in the regulation of bladder pain. Here we will apply state of the art approaches in systems
neuroscience to unravel the potential role of these unique neuronal subpopulations in the CeA in the reciprocal
regulation of pain, voiding dysfunction, and negative affective behaviors (IC/BPS-like conditions). What are the
respective roles of the two populations in bladder pain? Are the apparent pro- and anti-nociceptive actions of the
Pde1c and Cartpt populations, respectively, restricted to referred hypersensitivity, or do they also reciprocally
regulate ongoing pain? Do these populations play differential roles in the regulation of voiding behavior and
negative affective behaviors? What are the critical inputs to and projections from these neurons? Do these
populations undergo plasticity differentially in the induction and maintenance of cystitis? How do the dynamics
of this circuit change as cystitis resolves? Here we propose to answer these questions in a series of studies that
test the central hypothesis that maladaptive plasticity in these unique subpopulations of CeA neurons regulates
voiding dysfunction, pain sensitization, and comorbid negative affect in models of cystitis. These studies will
provide new insights into the critical role of the pro- and anti-nociceptive neurons in the CeA in bladder pain and
comorbid affective disorders in the context of bladder pain syndrome. If successful, these studies will point the
way to identifying pharmacological approaches to restore normal circuit function around these neurons to provide
relief from bladder pain, voiding dysfunction, and comorbid anxiety and depression in patients with IC/BPS."
10818460,"Project Summary
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously produced signaling molecule that impacts protein function by
modifying cysteine residues through the formation of a persulfide bond by a process termed sulfhydration
(persulfidation). It is produced enzymatically by three enzymes in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway:
cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfutransferase (3-
MST). Numerous studies have reported a protective role for H2S in experimental models of acute myocardial
ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart failure. While these studies and others have established a cytoprotective
role for H2S, there are still unresolved questions regarding the biology of H2S. For instance, there is a lack of
understanding in how the endogenous production of H2S is regulated. Additionally, there is a need to identify
protein targets of H2S in response to different stimuli to unravel the mechanism by with H2S impacts adaptation
to stress. This proposal aims to offer new insights into the regulation of the H2S-producing activity of CSE. We
present new data that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases CSE-derived H2S production via
phosphorylation of serine 126. Further studies identified perilipin 5 (Plin5) – a protein that promotes the
association of lipid droplets with mitochondria - as a protein modified by sulfhydration following nutrient
deprivation and AMPK activation. Our data also shows that the interaction of lipid droplets with mitochondria
following nutrient deprivation is dependent on CSE. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that in response
to nutrient stress, AMPK induces the H2S-producing activity of CSE to impart adaptive cellular mechanisms.
Specifically, we hypothesize that CSE-derived H2S maintains energy metabolism during nutrient stress by
regulating the mobilization of lipid droplets to the mitochondria, in part, by altering the sulfhydration of Plin5. In
Aim 1, we will investigate the impact of serine 126 phosphorylation on the H2S-producing activity of CSE. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the Impact of CSE-derived H2S on maintaining Lipid Droplet-fueled β-oxidation
during nutrient deprivation. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of sulfhydration on Plin5 during nutrient
deprivation. This project breaks new ground in defining a mechanism by which the H2S-producing activity of
CSE is regulated. As such, it has the potential to lead to the development of novel therapies aimed at
harnessing the physiological effects of H2S to combat cardiovascular disease."
10829929,"This renewal submission for an institutional training grant is aimed at providing research training for
postdoctoral trainees who will pursue careers related to critical care. The training program will be jointly based
in the Emory Critical Care Center and in the Department of Surgery at Emory University School of Medicine. It
will be multidisciplinary in nature, with faculty in the Departments of Surgery, Medicine, Pediatrics, Biomedical
Informatics, Anesthesiology, Microbiology and Immunology, Biochemistry and Biomedical Engineering
participating in the training program. The training program is two years of length, and all applicants must have
a graduate level degree (MD, PhD or equivalent). The goal of this training program is to provide cutting-edge
training in critical care research founded upon strong collaborations among clinicians and investigators. The
program director/principal investigator is Craig Coopersmith, Professor of Surgery at Emory University and the
Interim Director of the Emory Critical Care Center. The PI/PD will interface closely with an executive committee
made up of Timothy Buchman, MD, PhD (Professor of Surgery, Emeritus Director Emory Critical Care Center),
Greg Martin, MD (Professor of Medicine, Director of Research, Emory Critical Care Center), Mandy Ford, PhD
(Professor of Surgery), and Jonathan Sevransky, MD (Professor of Medicine) The program has 16 additional

to metabolomics to big data to predictive analytics in the intensive care unit. The program allows trainees to
choose either a traditional laboratory-based track or a clinical track where they will also obtain either a Master
of Science in Clinical Research or a Masters of Analytics. There are opportunities that span the entire age
range of critical illness – from neonates to geriatrics. To provide a diverse set of opportunities, mentors are
based at the following-types of hospitals in the Atlanta area within a 5 mile radius – academic (Emory
University Hospital), public/safety-net (Grady Memorial Hospital), community (Emory University Hospital
Midtown), federally-funded (Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center), and pediatrics (Children's Healthcare of
Atlanta Egleston Hospital). Ultimately, the research-training program is designed to reflect the collaborative
and interdisciplinary nature of clinical critical care and to develop independent researchers dedicated to
improving the outcomes of patients in the intensive care unit."
10833678,"This is the fourth competing renewal of the Yale Training Program in Geriatric Clinical Epidemiology and
Aging-Related Research. The objective of the Yale Program is to develop a cadre of physician scientists and
PhD investigators (clinicians and nonclinicians) with expertise in geriatric clinical epidemiology and/or
translational aging research and equip them to address the myriad of unanswered questions concerning the
diagnosis, etiology, treatment, prevention, and prognosis of the health problems experienced by the ever-
increasing number of older persons. We will accomplish this objective by providing highly qualified physicians,
who are already well trained in geriatrics and/or subspecialties with age-related relevance, and outstanding
PhD investigators with 2 to 3 years of rigorous research training. Our trainees will develop skills in each of 11
essential areas: 1) formulation of significant and focused research questions and hypotheses; 2) design of
observational, mechanistic and/or experimental studies to address focused research questions; 3) techniques
to successfully execute specific study designs; 4) project and/or laboratory management; 5) critical analysis of
the scientific literature; 6) principles of data science; 7) interpretation of findings; 8) oral and written
communication of scientific methods and findings; 9) development and implementation of strategies for
research support; 10) research team approaches and leadership; and 11) budget management. These skills
will be developed through a training experience that includes both didactic and experiential components. The
didactic curriculum includes courses offered through the Clinician Scholars Program, Investigative Medicine
Program and School of Public Health, coupled with several high quality aging-specific training forums at Yale
and “off site”. The central component of the Yale Program is a mentored research experience, which includes
structured meetings with Program Faculty in geriatrics/gerontology and at least one supervised research
project tailored to the trainee’s experiences and interests, with the goal of producing one or more first-
authored, peer-reviewed publications and a grant application to support further research. The Yale Program
has successfully recruited and retained a full complement of outstanding trainees during each of the first 19
years, and has successfully placed many of its graduates in tenure-track, research-intensive positions at top-
tier academic institutions. For the next five years, we request continued funding for four postdoctoral positions."
10840874,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a major mechanism that generates the vast transcriptome and proteome diversity
from the limited genome. Spatial and temporal regulation of AS contributes to cell differentiation and lineage
determination. Mutations that disrupt splicing cause a wide range of diseases including neurodegeneration,
muscular dystrophies, and cancer. Therefore, understanding and targeting splicing is essential to the future of
precision medicine. In the past 3 decades, AS studies have focused on cis elements and their associated trans
factors, such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs). The laws of thermodynamics dictate that RNAs fold into low free
energy structures in the context of RNA-protein complexes (RNPs), however, very little is known about how
pre-mRNA structures in large RNPs control splicing, and various RNA processing events in general. Our lab
invented several chemical crosslink-ligation based methods that enabled direct analysis of transcriptome-wide
protein-independent RNA 2D and 3D structures in vivo (PARIS and SHARC). In this proposal, in Aim 1, we
develop and benchmark a high throughput technology, SHARCLIP, to directly capture all RNA structures,
RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions together. SHARCLIP is conceptually similar to
methods that analyze protein-mediated chromatin conformations, e.g., ChIA-PET and hiChIP, and will bring
1D RNP interaction studies to higher dimensions. In aim 2, applying PARIS and SHARC to chromatin
associated RNAs, and the new method SHARCLIP to key splicing regulators, we will build transcriptome-wide
RNA-structure and RNA-protein interaction models and deconvolve their dynamics in 2 ENCODE cell lines
HepG2 and K562, as well as 6 brain cell lineages from a human iPS differentiation system. In aim 3, further
integrating cell type specific AS programs and disease variants implicated in splicing, we will test whether
mutations act by altering the structures. With the structure models as a guide, we will use a combination of
CRISPR genome editing and structure-perturbing antisense oligos to test the roles of specific structures in
regulating splicing in neuronal differentiation. Together, this proposal will produce a new technology that
simultaneously capture multi-valent RNA-protein interactome and RNA structurome in vivo, establish a
structure-based splicing code, provide an important resource to enable mechanistic studies of RNA processing,
and pave the way for future therapeutic targeting of splicing."
10825624,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organs “know” when and how to stop growing to arrive at the correct size and shape. Disruption of organ size
control mechanisms leads to congenital abnormalities, poor organ homeostasis and tissue repair, and tumors.
Exemplifying this fundamental mystery, adult zebrafish fins perfectly regenerate to their original size and shape
regardless of injury extent. Therefore, zebrafish fin regeneration is a compelling and tractable system to
interrogate “organ scaling” mechanisms. Bioelectricity, or ion flows across cell membranes, is long-associated
with both organ size control and regeneration. However, links between ion signaling and their effectors to
specific cell behaviors determining organ size are limited. Perturbed ion signaling, notably by elevated voltage-
gated K+ channel activity and inhibited Ca2+-dependent calcineurin signaling, leads to dramatic overgrowth of
regenerating zebrafish fins. A distal fibroblast-lineage pool of ""niche"" cells within the fin's regenerative
blastema sustains fin outgrowth. The niche progressively depletes as outgrowth slows, likely by net re-
differentiation to a non-growth promoting state. We recently discovered the classic longfint2 mutant phenotype
is caused by ectopic expression of the Kcnh2a potassium channel within the fibroblast/niche lineage. Ectopic
Kcnh2a disrupts orderly niche depletion, thereby prolonging the outgrowth period. Kcnh2a likely blocks Ca2+-
calcineurin signaling with both acting uniquely during late stages of regeneration. We made a Ca2+ responsive
GCaMP6s transgenic reporter line and found distal fibroblast / niche cells exhibit dynamic Ca2+ fluxes. Our
single cell transcriptomics identified candidate upstream voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We mutated the genes
encoding each channel, generating the first recessive model of dramatically elongated fins. We now
hypothesize niche-specific Ca2+ signaling, modulated by a cadre of Ca2+ channels, activates calcineurin to
promote niche-to-mesenchyme state transitions. We will pursue three Specific Aims to test this model and
identify mechanisms linking ion signaling to cell behaviors restoring fin size: 1) Characterize spatiotemporal
cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics and calcineurin activity in wildtype and long-finned zebrafish, 2) Determine how
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels modulate regenerating fin Ca2+ dynamics and fin outgrowth, and 3) Determine
how Ca2+ dynamics and calcineurin promote cell behaviors for fin growth cessation. Our proposed research will
associate voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-modulated intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, downstream calcineurin signaling,
and a novel “niche” state transition towards answering the classic mystery of robust organ scaling during fin
regeneration. Our study's broader impacts include identifying conceptual and mechanistic links of bioelectricity
to specific molecules and cell behaviors that determine organ size and form. Finally, studying robust adult
zebrafish skeletal regeneration will inform regenerative medicine approaches for human bone disease."
10792897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating form of epilepsy caused by loss of function of NaV1.1 (80-90% of cases),
the predominant voltage-gated Na+ channel expressed in inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons in the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This causes a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA),
resulting in hyperexcitability. The disease manifests itself within the first year of life and is usually triggered by
hyperthermia causing frequent and prolonged seizures that result in a host of health problems including
developmental delay, speech impairment, ataxia, hypotonia and sleep disturbances.
 Two small molecule monotherapies have been approved recently by the FDA: Epidiolex (Cannabidiol or
CBD) in 2018 and Fintepla (fenfluramine or FA) in 2020 for patients two years of age and older. Even though
they reduce the frequency of seizures, these drugs at their effective dosages cause multiple side effects. Their
mechanism(s) of action to reduce epileptiform activity remain(s) unknown.
 G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have been strongly implicated in epilepsy. They are
activated by the Gβγ dimer of G proteins and by [Na+]i in a synergistic manner. The basis of synergism lies in
that they each work allosterically to control predominantly the two channel gates: Gβγ, the membrane gate and
Na+, the cytosolic gate. In the case of the GABAergic interneurons, we hypothesize that NaV1.1 and GIRK1/2
are coupled, such that the Na+ entering through NaV1.1 promotes GIRK1/2 activity to hyperpolarize the cell and
ensure removal of NaV1.1 inactivation for fast spiking. In DS this mechanism becomes compromised causing
cell depolarization and inactivation of voltage-gated channels at large present in GABAergic neurons failing to
compensate for the loss of NaV1.1. We use GAT1508, a specific activator of GIRK1/2 to compensate for the
compromised Na+ entry. Since GAT1508 opens the cytosolic gate, we ask whether it synergizes with CBD (via
CB1R) and FA (via 5-HT1DR) to open more fully the membrane gates. In Aim 1, experiments designed to test
the hypothesis are aimed at the cellular level in both heterologous expression and in native GABAergic neurons.
In Aims 2 and 3, we utilize a DS mouse model, heterozygous for the Scn1a gene that encodes NaV1.1, and in
Aim 2, we test the hypothesis at the brain slice level, where synapses and transmitter release remain intact, and
compare the DS model to a wild-type animal model. In Aim 3, we pursue experiments at the whole animal level
(DS model), using simultaneous EEG and 2-photon microscopy to monitor the neuronal circuits involved."
10766787,"ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have profoundly altered cancer treatment. However, despite this technique’s success,
there remain major challenges to ICIs use that must be met to best advance these therapies. These include increasing
responsiveness to PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, uncovering new targets to optimize pathway blockade and addressing why
more than one third of all patients that receive ICIs develop often devastating immune related adverse events (irAEs)
syndromes characterized by various patterns of off-target organ inflammation. There is currently no clear understanding
of the complexity and heterogeneity of irAEs and as ICIs approaches are expanded, understanding the basic mechanisms
of irAEs stands to be a critical goal. We hypothesize that three distinguishable, but not mutually exclusive, pathogenic
processes drive irAEs, and that the contribution of each varies according to the type of the irAEs. The first process is not
tumor-related and is predetermined by known T cell autoimmune susceptibility genes, reflecting a failure of the negative
selection mechanism. However, progression to an autoimmune disease is held in a latent preclinical stage by peripheral
tolerance mechanisms until triggered by the inhibition of these mechanisms through ICIs. We hypothesize that the second
process driving irAEs is an intrinsic consequence of the T cell immune response directed to tumor antigens. We envision
that some of the TCR clonotypes responding directly to the tumor are specific for a peptide that is also expressed by target
organ MHC molecules involved in the irAEs, and that activation of this expanded clone by ICIs initiates its attack on the
tumor and on the target tissue, resulting in irAEs. Finally, since many of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are not clonal,
we hypothesize a third process of irAEs wherein the inflammatory response is mediated by promiscuous nonspecific TCR
clones activated by ICIs or the tumor inflammatory milieu. Aim 1. To characterize the human T cell repertoire of irAEs
patients. We will perform a gDNA repertoire analysis and single cell TCR seq of T cells isolated from the blood, synovial
fluid, and synovial tissue of patients with irAEs, to uncover the physical-chemical properties of CDR3s in comparison to T
cells that mediate other autoimmune diseases. We will take advantage of the gDNA to test the hypothesis that the
entrance of these self-reactive TCRs in a patient’s repertoire is influenced by the variants of the same non-HLA alleles
associated with other autoimmune disease susceptibility and the failure of negative selection and examine the role of the
MHC allotype on repertoire selection and irAEs development. We will use humanized immune system mice to recreate,
from hemopoietic stem cells, a replica of the irAEs patients’ pre-ICIs and pre-tumor TCR repertoire, to study repertoire
evolution. Aim 2. To immunophenotype the irAEs mouse model. We developed a novel mouse model for ICIs-induced
adverse events. We will perform CITEseq of T cells isolated from tumors and inflamed organs to uncover differential
subsets of cells and their functions across different types of tumors. Through tetramer staining and TCRseq, we will
uncover the contribution of tumor-specific T cells to the pathogenesis of irAEs. We will utilize multiplex IF studies to
uncover the contribution of the tumor and the inflamed organ microenvironment to the function of the infiltrating cells."
10871684,"Background: As of May 19, 2022, 3,427 of the 17,307 Veterans living with spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D)
who have received services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal year (FY) 2022 had a
confirmed positive COVID-19 test, with 187 COVID-related deaths. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing
guidelines during the pandemic have had numerous effects on this population including disrupting healthcare,
increased mortality and morbidity as well as negative psychosocial effects. Veterans with SCI/D are a unique
population within the VHA who are primarily served at 25 SCI/D Centers nationally. Veterans with SCI/D have
higher rates of chronic physical conditions than other Veterans. Research on the pandemic impact on Veterans
with SCI/D is scant but critical to study because these individuals utilize VHA health services as their primary
source of health care and SCI/D support (e.g., wheelchair repair, home-based care, bowel and bladder care,
assistive technology, etc.). To inform program planning and resource allocation, it is essential to know how the
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health service delivery, access to essential resources, and mortality and
morbidity among Veterans with SCI/D. This explanatory mixed methods study will fill this gap in knowledge by
examining patient-, community-, and system-level factors related to changes in health services care, physical
and mental health outcomes in Veterans with SCI/D.
Significance: Given the elevated risk of chronic physical conditions and mortality for Veterans with SCI/D, it is
imperative that VHA provides health services to address the needs of this population. This study responds to the
VA SCI/D National Program Office priorities to support, promote, and maintain the health, independence, quality
of life, and productivity of Veterans with SCI/D throughout their lives. Further, this project identifies challenges
faced by Veterans with SCI/D during the COVID-19 pandemic and utilizes these results to inform health services
for future emergency events and global disasters.
Specific Aims: The project’s three aims are scientifically important and reflect extensive input from key Veteran
and SCI/D stakeholders regarding how to improve the quality of SCI/D services: (1) Identify COVID-19 related
disruptions and adaptations in health services utilization and mortality and morbidity among Veterans with
SCI/D; (2) Qualitatively evaluate Veterans’ and providers’ perspectives on how health services utilization
changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent impact on mortality and morbidity; and (3) Examine
Veterans experiences and decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methodology: Our study is guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health
conceptual framework. In Aim 1, we will estimate incidence rate ratios of health services utilization, morbidity,
and mortality in the year prior and years 1 and 2 after the start of the pandemic. We will also examine if there
are differences between the time periods by Veteran, SCI/D and VHA, and community factors. Finally, we will
conduct exploratory analyses of patterns of disrupted care (n=18,331 in FY20). Aim 2 will be to conduct focus
groups with Veterans with SCI/D (n=4 groups with ~3-5 Veterans per group) and VHA providers who deliver
healthcare services for these Veterans (n=2 groups with ~3-5 providers per group). For Aim 3, we will conduct
a national survey with Veterans with SCI/D who use VHA health services (n=~6,100, which approximates 35% of
the 17,307 currently living Veterans with SCI/D identified by the National SCI/D Registry).
Next Steps/Implementation: Results will be of immediate value to the SCI/D National Program Office to identify
health services needs for Veterans with SCI/D and will be used to develop measures for enhanced emergency
preparedness for future disasters. This information will have broad and long-ranging impacts on the SCI/D
System of Care, informing access improvement projects, telehealth service expansion, performance measures
development, and VHA enrollment and health care projection modeling (20+ year timeframe)."
10807023,"Filoviruses (Ebola [EBOV] and Marburg [MARV]) are zoonotic, emerging pathogens that cause sporadic and
global outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. As EBOV and MARV can
establish persistent infections in the CNS, semen, eye, and other immunologically privileged sites inaccessible
to antibody therapy, and their re-emergence can result in long-term sequelae and death, understanding of host
defense mechanisms that could lead to the development of new antiviral therapies is more critical than ever. Our
lab is at the forefront of identifying host proteins that interact both physically and functionally with the filovirus
VP40 matrix protein, the driving force for virus assembly and egress, to regulate these late stages of virus
replication. To better understand the functional filovirus-host interactome, our laboratory has focused on direct
interactions between the PPxY Late (L) domain motif conserved in the VP40 proteins of EBOV (eVP40) and
MARV (mVP40) and modular WW-domains from select host proteins. In addition to positive regulators of filovirus
egress, we have recently identified WW-domain interactors that negatively regulate VP40-mediated budding,
including YAP/TAZ, BAG3, and WWOX. While the impact of these negative regulators is likely multifactorial and
complex, we have made the intriguing observation that filamin B, a common downstream effector of YAP/TAZ
and BAG3, acts as a potential dual regulator of live EBOV/MARV infectivity/entry and live EBOV/MARV egress.
As dual role regulation of key stages at opposite ends of the filovirus lifecycle is novel and unexpected, the
ultimate goal of this proposal is to determine how host protein filamin B mechanistically impacts the filovirus
lifecycle. Filamins are a family of actin crosslinking/stabilizing proteins that regulate actin dynamics at the plasma
membrane to control cell migration and morphology, vesicle trafficking, macropinocytosis, and cell division.
Notably, macropinocytosis
macropinosomes
is
(MPs) that are densely coated with actin, filamin, and filamin-associated proteins
a key entry pathway for filoviruses, as these viruses enter the cell in vesicles
termed
. In addition,
filamins are linked to cellular processes that mimic virion formation and/or egress such as filopodia formation,
cell migration, and cytokinesis. Thus, we hypothesize that filamin B regulates infectivity/entry of filoviruses
through effects on macropinocytosis, and regulates filovirus budding through effects on egress of filopodia-like
filovirus particles. In this exploratory proposal, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which filamin
regulates filovirus infectivity/entry (Aim 1) and egress (Aim 2). Results from these studies will impact the field by
identifying a novel host protein(s) whose expression modulates two critical and opposite steps in the filovirus
lifecycle; entry and exit, as well as providing a better fundamental understanding of the functional filovirus-host
interactome and host defense mechanisms that could lead to the development of new antiviral therapies."

We are now facing a shortage of endocrine physician scientists, who are among the individuals expected to
present innovative solutions to our national health priorities. The goal of the Endocrine Research Training
Program (ERTP) at the University of Chicago, now in its 46th year of NIH funding, is to train capable, creative,
and thoughtful adult and pediatric endocrine physician scientists of diverse backgrounds for careers in modern
endocrine investigation. At the completion of training, it is anticipated that trainees will be able to
independently initiate investigations into areas important for understanding of endocrine disorders or of health
disparities and economics in populations with endocrine disorders. In the past 15 years, 67% of our trainees
have entered academic research positions, and 41% of these individuals have received subsequent funding,
including K and R01 awards. The Aims of the ERTP are:
 (1) To recruit a competitive pool of physician postdoctoral fellows from diverse backgrounds who embrace
 a commitment to endocrinology research.
 (2) To engage physician fellows in an endocrine training pathway that integrates a basic/translational
 research component with a subspecialty training curriculum.
 (3) To graduate physician fellows who will be competitive for endocrine-related research funding.
 (4) To foster the interest of medical students to pursue careers in endocrinology through summer research
opportunities
To achieve these aims, we have assembled 35 training faculty from eight University departments who carry out
a diverse range of endocrine-related research supported by a substantial base of NIH and other peer reviewed
research grants. Trainees are selected on the basis of individual accomplishments including prior research
training and experience as well as commitment to an academic research career. Trainees select a faculty
preceptor(s) and the trainee and preceptor jointly identify a research project. Trainees then undergo intensive
training under the purview of the preceptor, during which time they assume a progressively greater
responsibility for developing research hypotheses, designing experiments, analyzing the data and preparing
abstracts and scientific manuscripts. In the final year of training, an area of research is identified that is
sufficiently different from the research of the preceptor to allow the trainee to submit an independent research
grant proposal. This research training occurs within the framework of a required core curriculum consisting of
coursework, responsible conduct of research training, and rigor and reproducibility training. As a result of this
intensive training, more than two-thirds of trainees from this program assume academic positions upon
completion of their training and remain active in endocrinology research."

periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must
be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and

propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of
Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for
academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral
trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to
advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches
including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental
hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and
tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each
school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician.
Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with
significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1)
engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees,
tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3)
principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and
career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia
presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications
focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of
Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding
candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will
diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of
a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program,
unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where
resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry."
10912706,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Definitive characterization of cytoarchitecture and its alternation is key to clinical diagnosis and patient
management in disease, including cancer. Current standard-of-care of such microstructure characterization is
based primarily on histopathological assessment via biopsy sampling of suspected lesions. However, invasive
biopsy procedures carry burdens of procedure complexity, sampling errors, and complications. Thus, it is
desirable to have a non-invasive, high-sensitivity, high-specificity imaging tool that accurately assesses tumor
microstructures that are comparable to that obtained from biopsy/histopathology. This will have the clinically
significant result of reducing unnecessary biopsies at the minimum, and perhaps reduce the overall number of
biopsy procedures and repeat biopsies. Furthermore, this will significantly improve the precision of biopsy to
sample clinically significant cancers and regions most relevant to cancer prognosis. We propose to apply
advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI), including novel oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion encoding, for
tumor microstructure imaging and the pilot application will be to improve characterization of the epithelium,
stroma, and lumen volume fractions which are highly correlated to prostate cancer grades. OGSE dMRI has
been attempted in clinical whole-body MRI but the technique has had only modest success due to the limited
gradient performance of whole-body MRI scanners. The gradient amplitude and slew rate of existing clinical
whole-body 3.0T MRI scanners are often constrained by peak power of the gradient driver. Many clinical 70-
cm wide-bore MRI systems operate at 1 MVA peak power, while some high-end systems increase the peak
power to 2-2.7 MVA. However, the 2-3X higher peak power substantially increases the overall cost of MRI
systems and requires major increases to the hospital's electrical service and cooling infrastructure to
accommodate increased electrical power and thermal loads. Consequently, such upgrades become cost
prohibitive and are impractical for wide adoption. Our technical solution is to build a new 4 MVA silicon
carbide (SiC) semiconductor gradient driver which replaces a conventional silicon 1 MVA or 2 MVA gradient
driver in clinical 3.0T wide-bore MRI scanners without requiring any changes to facility infrastructure. We
have assembled a diverse, multi-disciplinary team from GE Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
and Stanford University to develop MRI tools and methods to address clinical needs of non-invasive tumor
microstructure imaging to solve clinically significant problems in cancer. We will demonstrate tumor
microstructure imaging enabled by higher gradient amplitude and slew rate can provide clinical diagnostic
information on tumor characterization comparable to that obtained from biopsy and move closer to the goal of
reducing unnecessary biopsies. We will demonstrate the clinical significance in prostate cancer, as it is the
second leading cause of death in men. It is applicable to other cancers and a broad range of clinical applications
where non-invasive tumor microstructure characterization will significantly improve patient management."
10836498,"Although the approval of novel targeted therapy drugs, such as BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), MEK inhibitors (MEKi),
and immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized melanoma treatment, long-term outcomes are still
disappointing for many patients because of the development of drug resistance. A major contributing factor to
tumor resilience and relapse is the presence of a “plastic” microenvironment, which is comprised of
heterogeneous stromal cell populations embedded in a dense and stiff extracellular matrix (ECM). Particularly,
the ECM not only functions as a barrier to drug penetration and distribution and also provides structural and
adaptive signals, which can induce therapeutic escape pathways in melanoma cells. Genetically stable cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to be a notorious ECM-remodeling machine in the tumor stroma. We
have discovered that the number of CAFs with nuclear β-catenin in the melanoma stroma increases significantly
after the patients are treated with BRAFi/MEKi. We have established that increased nuclear β-catenin in CAFs
is induced by BRAFi but not MEKi. Nevertheless, how BRAFi stimulates CAFs to reprogram their biological
functions via hyperactivated nuclear β-catenin activity remains to be understood. We have obtained compelling
data demonstrating that targeted depletion of β-catenin in CAFs ablates their ability to remodel the tumor
microenvironment, downregulates abnormal BRAF/MAPK/ERK signaling in melanoma cells, and suppresses
melanoma cell drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. RNA-Seq data show that β-catenin is essential for CAF to
remodel the ECM by coining the CAF transcriptome. We have identified the β-catenin/TCF4 target gene periostin
(POSTN) as an important matricellular protein secreted by CAFs to promote BRAFi resistance. The central
hypothesis is that decoding and targeting the ECM-remodeling CAFs has the potential to create a drug-sensitive
microenvironment that sensitizes melanoma cells to therapeutic agents and increase their response rate. In Aim
1, we will elucidate the pro-activation pathway(s) by which BRAFi stimulates CAFs to mediate melanoma drug
resistance phenotypes. We will assess the role of hyperactivated nuclear β-catenin in the function of CAFs in
melanoma. In Aim 2, we will determine whether the β-catenin-TCF4 transcriptional complex is the signaling hub
that controls CAF-driven ECM remodeling and BRAFi/MEKi resistance. We will evaluate whether disrupting the
β-catenin-TCF4 interaction in CAFs will sensitize BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to BRAFi/MEKi in vivo. In Aim
3, we will determine the roles of CAF-derived POSTN in melanoma cell growth and resistance to BRAFi/MEKi.
We will investigate signaling pathways that are activated by POSTN in melanoma cells to promote their
proliferation and resistance to BRAFi. The expected outcomes are to be an in-depth mechanistic characterization
of the complex interactions among CAFs, BRAFi, and the ECM microenvironment that promote the growth and
drug resistance in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. The knowledge obtained will open the possibility of developing
a “magic bullet” that could destroy the tumor niche to improve targeted therapy and optimize patient outcomes."

 The emerging Hippo pathway plays a major role in development, cell growth, tissue homeostasis, and
organ size. Dysregulation of Hippo pathway contributes to human diseases, most notably cancer. TCGA study
with analysis of over nine thousand human tumor samples has revealed that Hippo is one of the nine signals
pathways that are frequently altered and contributes to human cancer. The Hippo pathway consists a kinase
cascade that phosphorylates and inhibits the downstream transcription module of YAP/TAZ. A wide range of
signals have been discovered to modulate the Hippo pathway. However, the precise mechanism of Hippo
pathway regulation, particularly how upstream signals feed into the Hippo kinase cascade, is largely unknown.
The major goal of this proposal is to understand the fundamental mechanism of Hippo pathway regulation. By
screening for natural compounds to modulate the Hippo pathway, we have discovered that microcolin B (MCB)
potently activates the Hippo kinases. Our preliminary study indicates that MCB directly targets
phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) to activate the Hippo pathway. PITP functions to transfer
phosphatidylinositol from ER, the site of synthesis, to other compartment membranes, particularly plasma
membrane, in the cell. Our preliminary data suggest an exciting and novel model that phosphatidylinositol
metabolites play a key role in Hippo regulation. We further propose that NF2, which is a key upstream regulator
of the Hippo pathway and can bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), may mediate the PIP signal to Hippo
regulation. This proposal aims to demonstrate the function and mechanism of phosphatidylinositol and its
metabolites in Hippo regulation and how PIPs mediate upstream signals to Hippo. Further, completion of this
project will provide exciting scientific basis of using small molecules to target the Hippo pathway for YAP
dependent cancer."

Heart failure currently drives a significant proportion of health and economic burden in the United States.
Although steps have been made in developing effective treatments, the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of
heart failure continues to rise. Thus, it is important to seek out new, more effective therapeutics through the
study of molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Maladaptive cardiac remodeling is driven
by changes in gene expression and protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes. How post-transcriptional
modifications control the outcome of gene expression to regulate the synthesis of specific proteins in the heart
is unclear. We found that METTL3, the methylase responsible for m6A formation on mRNAs, is a critical
regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and is essential for the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. However, the
mechanisms through which METTL3 impacts remodeling has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal we
examine the role of METTL3-dependent methylation in regulating mRNA translation for maintenance of heart
function at baseline and in adaptation to stress. Utilizing METTL3 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, we
aim to uncover the mechanisms through which METTL3 regulates hypertrophic heart remodeling. Considering
the critical importance of this enzyme in the heart we will also address the mechanisms regulating its function
and specificity. These findings will further our understanding on how post-transcriptional modifications control
cardiac gene expression, while also uncovering new targetable pathways for therapeutic development."

 The goals of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the molecular signaling of protein translation initiation in
circulating human platelets and characterize the plasma growth factor- or hormone-driven pathways, map the
regenerating human platelet proteome, and determine the roles of constitutive translation in platelet functional
reactivity; 2) to determine the roles of ARGONAUTE2 (AGO2, Ago2 in mice) in platelet mRNA, microRNA
(miRNA) and protein expression, platelet reactivity, and the specific roles of platelet miRNA-mediated
suppression of translation in hemostasis and thrombotic potential. The studies in this proposal will elucidate
essential concepts of the molecular physiology of platelet function. In addition, these studies will have profound
implications for two areas of widespread clinical significance: alterations in growth factor/hormone
homeostasis, and current use and development of pharmacological inhibitors of translation in disease
treatment. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to roles of translation in so-called “resting” platelets in
circulation, following the overall presumption that translation is of limited importance. In prior studies of
“resting” platelet translation, ex vivo platelets were removed from their native plasma environment, and
translation steadily came to a halt. We interpret these prior studies to suggest instead that platelets undergo
translation constitutively in the presence of plasma, e.g., in circulation, and that this expenditure of molecular
resources and cellular energetics is critical for platelet protein homeostasis and functionality. Our strong
preliminary data support this hypothesis and we propose a series of innovative approaches to investigate this
poorly understood aspect of platelet biology and its functional outcomes. We have shown for the first time that
platelets in circulation undergo constitutive translation of a robust proteome due to translation initiation
signaling driven by plasma-borne growth factors and hormones, that this process is modulated by platelet
miRNAs and AGO2, and that constitutive miRNA-modulated translation in platelets regulates platelet function.
We will pursue an array of innovative approaches to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1- 1) “resting” platelets
in circulation are translationally active due to ongoing signaling initiated by plasma growth factors and
hormones; 2) constitutive translation driven by plasma growth factors maintains platelet protein homeostasis
necessary for hemostatic function; Aim 2 - 1) abundant miRNAs and Ago2-mediated RNA inhibition in platelets
modulate constitutive translation driven by plasma growth factors and hormones; 2) Ago2/miRNA-mediated
suppression maintains platelets in a reactive state necessary to support hemostasis while limiting thrombosis.
Together, the outcomes of these studies will significantly expand our understanding of control of platelet
function, hemostasis and thrombosis, as well as implications for platelet reactivity and function in growth factor
or hormone imbalance in disease, and potential impacts of clinical translation inhibitors on these processes."

Many psychiatric illnesses are characterized by episodes of behavioral disruption. The current project attempts
to understand the mechanisms mediating transitions between healthy and unhealthy brain and behavioral
states. Stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric illnesses and is routinely employed to alter behavioral states
in preclinical models. This application will utilize chronic and postpartum stress to facilitate the transition to the
unhealthy network and behavioral state and investigate the mechanisms mediating these transitions.
Neuroactive steroids (NAS) exert robust anxiolytic and antidepressant effects and a NAS-based treatment,
brexanolone/Zulresso®, recently received FDA approval as the first antidepressant treatment for postpartum
depression. This project will utilize these clinically effective NAS to investigate the impact on network and
behavioral states. Our preliminary data demonstrates that chronic unpredictable stress and inappropriate
postpartum stress can corrupt network activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and that NAS can restore
healthy network and behavioral states. Further, we demonstrate the ability of NAS to alter network activity
across species, including in humans (Conte Center Overview preliminary data), highlighting the translational
relevance of this approach. Despite these provocative preliminary findings, we still lack an understanding of the
mechanisms mediating transitions between network and, therefore, behavioral states. The prolonged
antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone are not easily explained by the known mechanism of action as
positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) at GABAA receptors. In collaboration with our Conte Center collaborators
and the Chemistry Core, we will investigate which of the diverse properties of NAS are capable of restoring
healthy network and behavioral states with the goal of gaining a better understanding of their therapeutic
properties."

This project endeavors to build a nanosensor array platform technology to detect whole disease fingerprints from
patient biofluids to facilitate diagnosis, screening, and biomarker discovery efforts. Serum biomarker measure-
ments are widely used as diagnostic indicators, but many markers are not sufficient for assessments of disease
state. Major factors limiting diagnosis and screening using most biomarkers include their low specificity for dis-
eases and the overall dearth of established molecular markers. Innovative approaches are needed to identify
new biomarkers and/or improve screening and diagnostic efforts in the absence of validated biomarkers. We
believe that the differentiation of diseased from normal biofluids may be achieved by the detection of a “disease
fingerprint” through the collection of large data sets of molecular binding interactions to a diverse set of moder-
ately-selective sensors, which are used to train machine learning algorithms. We will build a sensor array com-
prising organic color centers (OCCs, covalently-modified carbon nanotubes) to transduce subtle differences
in physicochemical properties of molecules in biofluids. With sufficient diversity, the sensors can differentiate bi-
ofluids by disease status with the aid of machine learning processes. In preliminary experiments, we found that
a library of OCC-DNA nanosensors exhibited sensitive and differentiated spectral variation to probe an ensemble
of molecular binding events. Via machine learning algorithms, we built a prediction model of nanosensor re-
sponses that reliably identified high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) substantially better than the estab-
lished, FDA-approved biomarker, CA125, using an initial set of 264 patient serum samples (Nat Biomed Eng,
2022). Despite advances in the understanding and management of HGSC, survival is currently poor when diag-
nosed at later stages, and detection is uncommon at early stages. Surgery is the first-line treatment, and cancer
recurs in 70% of patients in remission. Secondary surgery can prolong survival but only if performed early enough
to enable complete resection. Improved detection of early-recurrent and early-stage HGSC would therefore
markedly increase survival rates. We plan to develop a robust diagnostic sensor platform to improve early de-
tection of ovarian cancer and recurrence, and to accelerate biomarker discovery processes. Additionally, quan-
titative analysis of proteins bound to the sensors can determine the unique pattern of protein adsorption respon-
sible for the disease-specific spectral responses, thereby potentially facilitating biomarker discovery. We propose
to investigate: 1) the diversity of molecular sensitivities of OCC-DNA nanosensor elements required to differen-
tiate patient samples, 2) machine learning-based classification of disease, focusing on early-recurrence and
early-stage HGSC, 3) the molecular mechanism of the sensor response, and 4) the potential of the array to
facilitate identification of novel biomarkers. Successful completion of this work will result in a validated platform
to enable concomitant identification of disease and acceleration of biomarker discovery processes in HGSC, with
applicability to many potential indications."

Chronic pain is a major public health challenge that is inadequately addressed. While opioids afford acute relief,
their chronic use often leads to addiction and intolerable side-effects in patients. We and others have shown that
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) field stimulation blocks pain in patients and pre-clinical models, which provides an
opportunity to directly identify the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain, and hopefully to find novel non-
opioid approaches to reduce pain. One protein we have identified to be a valid target is the calcium/calmodulin
(Ca2+/CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), a critical regulator of the analgesic effects of DRG stimulation.
CaMKII is able to orchestrate diverse cellular functions to match required changes in excitable cell activity.
Knowledge on the role of CaMKII in regulating peripheral nervous system and primary sensory neuron function
is limited. Prior studies examining its role in pain have consistently associated it with mechanisms generating
pain rather than analgesia, based on experiments exposing both the peripheral nervous system and the central
nervous system to pharmacological inhibitors of CaMKII signaling. In contrast, our promising initial findings ex-
amining CaMKII signaling specifically in peripheral sensory neurons, i.e., those with their cell bodies in the DRGs,
indicate that painful conditions induced in preclinical models are associated with deficient sensory neuron
CaMKII signaling. Selective inhibition of peripheral sensory neuron CaMKII at the level of the DRG produces
hyperalgesia, while amplification of sensory neuron CaMKII signaling by molecular or electrical neuromodulation
approaches produces potent analgesia. We have developed viral approaches highly suited for selectively tar-
geting CaMKII in primary sensory neurons, and are proposing the following Aims to test the hypothesis that
reduced activity of CaMKII in peripheral sensory neurons drives the maintenance of chronic pain, and increasing
activity of CaMKII in DRG will alleviate chronic pain. Specifically, Aim 1. Establish the role of peripheral sensory
neuron CaMKII activity in suppressing pain. Aim 2. Identify the anatomic site of action for sensory neuron CaMKII
analgesia. Aim 3. Determine molecular mechanisms of CaMKII inactivation in animal and cell models of pain.
Completion of the proposed project will generate new insights on how sensory neuron CaMKII regulates the
development of neuropathic and osteoarthritic pain, along with proof-of-concept foundations for developing novel
opioid-free treatments based on selective reversal of chronic pain-induced down-regulated CaMKII activity."

Disparities in health outcomes and access to care for children and adolescents are large and persistent, with
worse outcomes observed among children and adolescents who are Black and Hispanic, enrolled in Medicaid,
live in low-income households, and live in rural areas. School-based health centers (SBHCs) may help to
promote health equity by making care more accessible and affordable to school-aged children, meaning
SBHCs are well-positioned to reduce disparities in health care use and health outcomes. Prior research
generally suggests benefits from SBHCs. However, most studies only examine a few SBHCs and report
correlational associations rather than causal evidence. This proposed study of SBHCs in California and
Oregon will overcome the limitations of prior studies by using a large sample and rigorous causal inference
methods. Because both states have experienced recent growth in SBHCs, we will exploit variation in
availability of SBHCs over time and across schools to compare the impact of SBHCs on students before and
after the opening of SBHCs in treatment schools (with SBHCs) and control schools (without SBHCs). Using
multiple years of health insurance claims data, survey data, and education data, we will: (1) characterize
SBHCs, including the services they provide, the patients receiving care at SBHCs, and changes since the start
of the COVD-19 pandemic; (2) estimate the impact of SBHC access on health care utilization, cost, health
outcomes, and education outcomes overall and for members of health disparity populations (defined by
race/ethnicity, household income, and rurality); and (3) examine the dimensions on which SBHC
characteristics vary, including location, services offered, size, and the pandemic to inform the operation of
current SBHCS and design of future SBHCs. The proposed research is timely and important due to
longstanding and new barriers to health care and the increasing recognition of the importance of schools in
promoting the healthy development of children and adolescents."
10840891,"Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are important for the clinical diagnosis of intrinsic blood cell and
hematopoietic disorders, and also as predictors of various heart, lung, and blood disease outcomes. Moreover,
hematologic quantitative traits are highly heritable and serve as a model system for studying the genetic
architecture of complex traits. While significant strides in understanding the genetic basis of hematological traits
have been made over the past decade, the wealth of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from emerging
resources such as the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program provides an
unprecedented opportunity to gain further insight in several key areas, including the role of structural variants
(SVs). While a few common SVs (e.g., α-globin) are known to be associated with blood cell traits, a more
systematic and agnostic genome-wide search for SVs in large samples is required to identify new biology. The
centralized availability of deeply sequenced DNA from the NHLBI TOPMed and the NHGRI Centers for Common
Disease Genomics (CCDG) programs, along with genome-wide data from UK Biobank and other cohorts, allows
for full characterization of SVs genome-wide at population-scale. By improving the accuracy of genome-wide SV
calling for WGS data as implemented in our new Genvisis software package and by validating candidate causal
SVs using state-of-the-art gene-editing technologies in hematopoietic cells, our interdisciplinary approach will
facilitate the translation of genetic association findings into mechanistic insights, discover new biology underlying
hematopoiesis, and ultimately identify factors that account for individual differences in pathobiology or response
to treatments. In Aim 1, using WGS data from TOPMed and CCDG participants, we will apply novel methodology
to generate high-quality and more accurate SV calls than the SV calling algorithms currently available for both
WGS and existing array data. In Aim 2, we will use the newly generated SV calls to conduct single-variant and
gene-based segmental association analyses of SVs with blood cell traits and related clinical outcomes in up to
570,319 participants. Association findings will be replicated in up to 760,000 participants in populations/studies
not used in the discovery phase. SVs that are significantly associated with blood cell traits will subsequently be
tested for association with other blood disorders including clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)
and VTE. In Aim 3, targeted long-range sequencing will be performed in selected samples to precisely localize
newly identified blood trait-associated SVs in complex genomic regions. We will also perform functional genomic
annotation of replicated blood cell trait-SV associations followed by state-of-the art gene-editing approaches to
understand novel mechanisms underlying genetic regulation of hematopoiesis. This model integrative approach
to advancing precision medicine research in heart, lung, and blood diseases will demonstrate for the first time
the role of SVs in the genetic architecture of hematologic traits and contribute to a better understanding of
hematopoiesis and pave the way for new research into Precision Medicine for blood diseases."

 Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor, but can also
arise in other tissues such as lacrimal gland, breast and skin. ACC tumors display heterogeneous morphology
and have a variable clinical course. Many ACC patients survive 10 years or more after the standard therapy of
surgery and radiation, but a fraction succumb much more quickly and others acquire distant metastases or
relapse 5 or more years after the initial treatment. So patients often have to endure significant morbidity
including reconstructive surgery while living under the threat of recurrence for decades.
 ACC is one of the only human tumors in which mutations involving the MYB oncogene are known to be the
most common driver. A large fraction of ACC tumors harbor a t(6;9) translocation, which juxtaposes an
enhancer from the NFIB gene on chromosome 9p close to the MYB oncogene on chromosome 6q. However,
ACC tumors have heterogeneous molecular characteristics. About half the tumors that express MYB harbor
translocations that fuse the MYB and NFIB genes, resulting in a ‘broken’ or truncated MYB gene that can only
express Myb proteins with C-terminal truncations – mutations that are known to activate the oncogenic
potential of the Myb transcription factor. But the remaining MYB positive tumors appear to express full-length
Myb proteins without any fusion to NFIB. And some tumors harbor different translocations that position the
MYB gene close to other enhancers or that involve the related MYBL1 gene instead of MYB. This molecular
heterogeneity is also reflected in the subgroups of ACC patients that have been identified by gene expression
profiling, including at least one poor-prognosis subgroup with a unique gene expression profile and another
subgroup that expresses neither MYB nor MYBL1 and must harbor as yet unidentified driver mutations.
 Deciphering the molecular events that lead to ACC has been complicated by the lack of adequate cell
models for this tumor. To avoid any issues from highly selected or mislabeled cell lines, our strategy has been
to utilize primary salivary gland ACC patient samples, an approach that has led to numerous important results
that have reshaped our understanding of ACC tumors. In this competing renewal application we will generate
the largest set of ACC tumor RNA-seq data in order to move the field forward in several ways. We will address
the heterogeneity of ACC tumors and patients, set the stage for the development of new therapeutic strategies
that target Myb proteins, use patient samples in a translational way to validate experimental results about Myb
protein biology and we will begin migrating our approaches to clinical (CLIA) laboratories to make them usable
in the clinic."
10883696,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working age populations. Glycemic control remains
the best strategy for preventing or slowing disease progression. However, early detection of vision threatening
retinal changes and prompt treatment is necessary for preserving visual function in more advanced stages.
Clinical management of DR also requires objective tools for assessing retinal structure and microvascular
abnormalities, as well as methods to evaluate treatment response. The goal of this multidisciplinary program is
to develop novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging methods and biomarkers that can identify and
characterize retinal microvasculature and blood flow alterations in DR, which can be used for early disease
detection, predicting progression, monitoring treatment response, and improving clinical trial efficiency. We will
develop next generation OCT angiography (OCTA) technology and analysis frameworks (Aim 1). This hardware-
software innovation will develop ultrahigh speed swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) to enable increased dynamic
range OCTA characterization of retinal blood flow, higher definition volumetric data to visualize vasculature at
the capillary level, and enable wide field structural and vascular imaging. These advances will develop a
quantitative surrogate marker for capillary level blood flow speeds in retinal microvasculature. The ability to
assess blood flow speeds at the capillary level represents a paradigm shift in OCTA imaging, enabling detection
of subtle vascular flow alterations that occur at earlier disease stages, which are related to pathogenesis of
diabetic macular edema (DME), capillary non-perfusion and neovascularization. New software motion correction
technology can correct volumetric OCT/OCTA data for eye motion in three dimensions and artificial intelligence
/ deep learning techniques can generate reliable layer segmentations for OCTA, to facilitate tracking longitudinal
changes across multiple patient visits. Using ultrahigh speed SS-OCT and OCTA blood flow biomarkers, we will
perform a cross-sectional study in a cohort of diabetic patients and age-matched healthy controls (Aim 2). The
study will evaluate repeatability of OCTA-driven VISTA flow markers, investigate if OCTA blood flow biomarkers
are correlated with DR severity, and if they are associated with DME, capillary non-perfusion or
neovascularization. Finally, we will monitor DR eyes longitudinally to investigate the role of subtle blood flow
alterations in disease progression and predicting treatment response (Aim 3). The hypothesis is that OCTA blood
flow biomarkers can identify regions with abnormal blood flow, which are at increased risk of thrombosis and
leakage, and hence DME, as well as regions that are ischemic, and at increased risk of neovascularization.
Similarly, we will also investigate if OCTA blood flow biomarkers can be used to predict response to anti-VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy, including DME resolution, neovascular regression, and/or treatment
durability. If successful, this program has the potential to improve clinical DR management and help DR patients
to achieve better vision outcomes."

 Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that affects 3-5 million people each year. Cholera is an is
caused by the Gram negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae and is frequently associated with epidemic
disease. V. cholerae is a native to aquatic ecosystems and a facultative human pathogen that infects
people through the consumption of contaminated water or food. Once ingested, V. cholerae colonizes the
small intestine where it produces a toxin that causes a dehydrating secretory diarrhea that can be rapidly
fatal. The devastating consequences of cholera, combined with the rapidity with which it can spread and
its ability to persist in aquatic ecosystems, underscore the need for the development of novel approaches
to combat this epidemic disease. Our recent studies in V. cholerae documented that multiple drug efflux
systems belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily function to efflux cellular
metabolites from the cell. We further showed that impaired efflux resulted in the metabolites accumulating
intracellularly where they interacted with periplasmic sensor proteins to initiate adaptive responses. This
included the activation of ToxR which resulted in increased leuO transcription and the downregulation of
virulence gene expression. However, the metabolites that were responsible for virulence repression
remain unknown. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that auto-inducers function to initiate the
expression of the adaptive responses that resulted in virulence repression. Two specific aims are
proposed. The first aim will investigate the function of ToxR and LeuO in cell density-dependent gene
regulation. The second aim will investigate the contribution of RND-mediated efflux to adaptive responses
and colonization. Determining the regulatory mechanisms and environmental cues that modulate V.
cholerae adaptive responses will illuminate important aspects of V. cholerae pathogenesis, provide a
better understanding of the factors that contribute to disease and epidemic spread, and highlight novel
approaches to combat cholera."

Senescent cells (SCs) cause senescence, a dominant risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI). SCs are cell
cycle-arrested (due to upregulated cell cycle inhibitors p16Ink4a and p21Cip1) and display a senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which is proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Senolytics, agents that kill
SCs, are now in clinical trials. We demonstrate senescence in the heme protein-mediated AKI model (HP-AKI)
as indicated by multiple indices. The significance of such changes – injurious or protective – is unknown as
regards AKI. The AKI field recognizes that mitochondrial injury drives AKI, while the senescence field
recognizes that mitochondrial injury elicits senescence; this application uniquely unites these two concepts.
Early in HP-AKI, we demonstrate that mitochondria are injured and their heme content increased; normal
mitochondria, exposed to such heme content, cease functioning. Heme, a prooxidant tetrapyrrole, present in
the ubiquitous family of heme proteins, is freed when heme proteins are destabilized because of cellular stress.
We also demonstrate that heme induces p16Ink4a/p21Cip1 and a SASP, and suppresses PGC-1α. In exploring
heme-induced mitochondrial injury and induction of p16Ink4a/p21Cip1, we focused on two transcription factors
both upregulated by mitochondrial injury, one, ETS1, being an inducer of p16Ink4a, the other, ATF4, an inducer
of p21Cip1. Our preliminary data demonstrate that these 4 principal molecules (ETS1, ATF4, p16Ink4a, p21Cip1)
are all induced in HP-AKI; in heme-exposed renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro; and in renal
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Our hypothesis is that AKI results from heme-mediated mitochondrial injury
and ensuing senescence, a thesis to be tested in three aims. Aim I: Define the role of heme-mediated
mitochondrial injury in ETS1 and ATF4 expression, senescence, and AKI. Using complementary in vivo
and in vitro approaches, we will sequentially examine the role of heme-mediated mitochondrial injury; the
contribution of ETS1, ATF4, and ETS1/ATF4-independent pathways; and the involvement of senescence in
AKI. Aim II: Define the roles of p21Cip1 and p16Ink4a in AKI: Genetic strategies. The role of p21Cip1 in AKI will
be examined by inducible deletion of high p21Cip1-expressing cells and with proximal tubule-specific p21 KO
mice. The role of p16Ink4a will be examined by inducible deletion of high p16Ink4a-expressing cells and by
inducible proximal tubule-specific deletion of high p16Ink4a-expressing cells. Aim III: Define the effect of
senolytics in AKI. SCs survive because of upregulated anti-apoptotic pathways, while senolytics kill SCs but
not non-SCs. This aim examines the efficacy of senolytics in AKI, and in reducing the sensitivity of aged mice
to AKI. In sum, this resubmitted R01 examines senescence in AKI, linking it sequentially to heme-mediated
mitochondrial injury, the transcription factors ETS1 and ATF4, and p16Ink4a and p21Cip1. This R01 offers novel
insights regarding the role of senescence in the pathogenesis of AKI and the therapeutic utility of senolytics."

Opioid-alcohol polysubstance use (PSU) is a clinically-relevant problem, as it worsens the trajectories and
outcomes of opioid use disorder (e.g., 14-16% of opioid overdoses also involve alcohol). Both alcohol and opioid
use alone are associated with significant neurobehavioral consequences, such as impaired cognition, but it is
not currently known if there are additive or synergistic impairments in such domains in opioid-alcohol PSU. In
order to determine the mechanisms underlying the deleterious consequences of opioid-alcohol PSU (e.g.
motivation to seek drug, relapse, cognition), rodent models are necessary. Here, we propose to develop novel
rodent models based on back-translated data from human opioid-alcohol polysubstance users. Thus, in this 2-
phase R61/R33 proposal, we will first assess human temporal patterns of opioid and alcohol use, in terms of
hour-by-hour and day-by-day use, using our novel assessment, the PolySubstance Use – Temporal Pattern
Section (PSU-TPS). We will also use the Substance Abuse Module-5 (SAM-5) to determine quantity, frequency,
and duration (QFD) of use and the presence of use disorders. These data will be used to define clusters of PSU
patterns, based on hours/day and days/month of use, and whether use is sequential, concurrent, or
simultaneous. In the same participants, cognition will be assessed at baseline and one year later. The domains
of interest include working and episodic memory, impulsivity, risky decision-making, and cognitive flexibility. We
will determine associations between opioid/alcohol use and cognition at both baseline and at the one year follow-
up. We will also compare the adverse consequences of use between PSU clusters, with a focus on QFD of use,
percent meeting DSM-V criteria for use disorder, and cognitive impairments. We will then back-translate the
most prevalent PSU patterns with deleterious consequences into rodents for the assessment of intravenous
opioid self-administration, motivation to seek opioids using demand curve analyses, and relapse to opioid-
seeking. We will also use rodent models to directly test the role of opioid and alcohol use and polysubstance use
on such cognitive impairments, using rodent tasks that have been established to assess the same domains as
in humans. We will also assess whether the two patterns of PSU alter the pharmacokinetics of alcohol and
opioids. This proposed 2-phase study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts in their fields to conduct
novel assessments of the patterns and consequences of real-world opioid-alcohol polysubstance use for the
establishment of translational animal models that can advance the field."
10824303,"Project Title: Rationally Designed, Target-specific Imaging Probes for Nephro-urology Diagnoses
Project Summary
 The project focuses on novel design and testing of kidney-specific probes for radionuclide renal
imaging. Unlike existing standard-of-care tracers used in the clinic that rely on passive uptake and
clearance mechanisms, our recombinant probes are based on targeted design for mapping kidney
functions, including filtration at the glomerulus and protein sorting at the proximal tubule. This approach
enables functional renal imaging with molecular specificity. We adapted a fusion strategy in designing the
probes, in which we joined modular segments of selected plasma proteins to form new hybrid probes.
These modular segments are the functional units that can individually interact with their cognate renal
receptors. Accordingly, it is anticipated that each probe will follow a guided intrarenal passage and
sequentially interactions with intended receptors. This novel approach holds promise, as demonstrated in
proof-of-concept studies and will continue to be pursued, for measuring distinct functions of the kidney. We
will accomplish our research goal via three interconnected and synergistic Specific Aims, which are
designed for measuring critical aspects of the renal function and pathophysiology, including glomerular
filtration and tubular reuptake (Aim 1), glomerular density (Aim 2), and the early pathological changes in
the filtration barrier (Aim 3). The studies will be conducted in acute and chronic settings as appropriate
using relevant kidney disease models such as ischemic/reperfusion injury, nephrotoxicity, hypertension
and autoimmunity, which are representative of common renal diseases in humans. Overall, our new probes
are intended for directly addressing the needs for early and specific markers of renal diseases. The imaging
data from these probes will provide important mechanistic insights for advancing the technologies toward
their ultimate translation to patient care."
10833632,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The two greatest fears expressed by patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are developing colon cancer and losing
their colon. Although colitis-associated cancer is less common, dysplasia is more common and often results in
colectomy. Our proposal leverages the work of the previous funding period and advances in the field to take a
translational approach to unraveling dysplasia in colitis. The focus of our studies has been the link between
innate immune signaling and intestinal bacteria leading to colitis-associated neoplasia. Our results have led us
to focus on the role of dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) in dysplasia. DUOX2 is a NADPH oxidase that catalyzes the
conversion of oxygen into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) upon interaction with the maturation factor DUOXA2. It is
consistently upregulated in biopsies from IBD patients and DUOX2/DUOXA2 expression is further increased in
patients who have had dysplasia. Our group has shown that both inflammatory and microbial signals induce the
expression and activity (H2O2 production) of DUOX2 in colonic epithelial cells. We have proven that chronic
activation of DUOX2 leads to the formation of tumors, which is almost totally abrogated by inactivating DUOX2
in the epithelium. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that IBD-associated dysbiosis activates Duox2 and
local production of H2O2 leading to epithelial barrier dysfunction, recruitment of tumor-promoting myeloid derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), and generation of a tumorigenic microbiome in a feed forward loop. This is pursued
in the following specific aims: 1) Determine the dependence of inflammatory colonic dysplasia on epithelial
Duox2 signaling. Here we will investigate epithelial barrier dysfunction and DNA damage pathways caused by
epithelial Duox2 activation using colonoid models (human and murine). Using humanized germ-free mice, we
will determine if the UC-dysplasia microbiome is sufficient to cause DUOX2-mediated permeability defects and
DNA damage. 2) Dissect the role of tumor-promoting MDSCs on dysplasia development in the setting of
DUOX2-mediated oxidative stress. Our preliminary data demonstrate that TLR4-driven tumors have enhanced
recruitment of tumor supporting MDSCs. Here we will identify DUOX2-dependent epithelial factors
(chemokines/cytokines) and the transcriptional (single cell-RNA seq) and functional (T cell suppressive)
characteristics of MDSCs in our murine models of tumorigenesis and UC patients with dysplasia. 3) Identify
targetable microbial pathways linked to Duox2 activation and dysplasia. Transfer of the microbiome from
tumor-susceptible villin-TLR4 mice is sufficient to transfer CAC susceptibility. New metagenomic and
metabolomic data show clear differences between UC dysplasia and UC without dysplasia. We will use our
mouse models and UC dysplasia samples to perform deep sequencing and metabolomic characterization of the
tumor-promoting microbiome. Metabolites will be tested for their ability to induce or inhibit H2O2/DUOX2 in
colonoids. The work proposed herein will provide the mechanistic justification for subsequent human studies to
target Duox2 and specific microbial pathways to halt progression from UC inflammation to dysplasia."
10832059,"PROJECT SUMMARY
GH and IGF-1 are well known to act on peripheral tissues to importantly influence growth, metabolism and body
composition. Recently, however, our preliminary work and other data in mice have suggested that central effects
of GH on the orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide AgRP (agouti-related protein) may be another important
mechanism by which GH exerts its nutritional and metabolic effects. AgRP neurons express GH receptors and
in mice, GH was shown to activate AgRP neurons to produce orexigenic responses. The current project stems
from our studies in acromegaly, a human model that provides unique insights into the mechanisms of GH/IGF-1
effects. We found novel evidence that plasma levels of AgRP, a marker of hypothalamic AgRP, are higher in
active acromegaly than in matched healthy subjects and are lower after surgery that reduced GH/IGF-1 or the
GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant that lowered IGF-1 levels. These data suggest that GH excess increases
AgRP in humans, but whether GH stimulates AgRP is unknown. Therefore, our 1st objective is to directly test the
hypothesis that GH stimulates AgRP in humans. To further investigate the AgRP-GH axis, the effect of the GLP-
1R agonist liraglutide on plasma AgRP levels will also be tested in this project. Peripherally administered
liraglutide targets hypothalamic GLP-1Rs and inhibits AgRP neurons in mice. Our 2nd Aim is to show that
liraglutide lowers plasma AgRP levels in humans. This effect of liraglutide has not been studied in humans; thus,
this study could uncover a key mechanism by which liraglutide affects body weight and metabolism. This project
also explores the potential link of GH-stimulated changes in AgRP to GH-induced insulin resistance. AgRP
impacts glucose metabolism in mice and plasma AgRP levels in healthy humans reflect differences in insulin
resistance. In mice, in the fed state, AgRP overexpression or its’ central infusion impair glucose metabolism.
Insulin resistance is a prominent feature of GH excess and GH administration is well known to induce insulin
resistance early after its initiation: AgRP rise may contribute to this. By a distinct mechanism of its action,
liraglutide, given along with GH, may lower AgRP and thus attenuate the insulin resistance that occurs with GH
alone. Liraglutide has not been tested for treatment of the clinically important problem of GH-induced insulin
resistance and thus novel, important data in this regard will be generated. We will test these hypotheses in a
randomized, placebo-controlled study in which we will administer supraphysiologic and replacement GH to
healthy and GH deficient humans, respectively, with and without co-administration of liraglutide. This project
utilizes human models to investigate the GH-AgRP axis, potentially a key mechanism of GH action and mediator
of GH-induced insulin resistance, and will provide valuable insights into the roles of AgRP and the GH-AgRP
axis in human disorders of GH, nutrition and growth."
10837078,"ABSTRACT:
Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a debilitating chronic condition characterized by pain,
pressure, and discomfort in the pelvic region coupled with urinary symptoms. The pain involved in IC/BPS can
be debilitating and is incurable. As it stands, many of the available treatments for IC/BPS lack strong evidence
for their use and are costly to patients. Further, patients report significant dissatisfaction with medical care,
describing treatments as “trial-and-error,"" expensive, and having “fragmented” treatment plans to follow.
Treatment advances in IC/BPS have stalled due to a lack of clear understanding of the condition, as symptoms
and presentations vary widely. For these reasons, national organizations have prioritized the need to improve
both treatment options and understanding of IC/BPS. Leading multi-institutional research networks have now
identified that individuals with IC/BPS have distinct subgroups, or “phenotypes,” largely characterized by the
distribution of pain throughout the body. These presentations of IC/BPS have distinct clinical and
neurobiological features. Specifically, while a proportion of individuals with IC/BPS have symptoms primarily in
the pelvic region (“peripheral” phenotype), others experience additional pain outside of the pelvis coupled with
unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction, emotional distress, and energy depletion (“centralized” phenotype).
In terms of neurobiological features, individuals with “centralized” presentations also exhibit exaggerated
inflammatory responses to ex vivo stimulation and heightened responses to evoked pain. Supported by our
preliminary evidence, the overall goal of this project is to assess how IC/BPS phenotype may affect response
to two different therapies often given without regard to patient phenotype, pelvic floor physical therapy (PT) and
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for IC/BPS. We hypothesize that we can predict those who will respond
preferentially to either form of treatment based on reported bodily pain distribution (pelvic pain primarily, pain
outside of the pelvis). We are proposing a randomized mechanistic trial to evaluate which participants may
benefit from each treatment (Aim 1) and evaluate whether neurobiological mechanisms may moderate
outcomes and change with treatment (Aim 2). Per an individual’s reported level of baseline widespread pain,
we will randomize 220 participants to receive either 8-weeks of CBT or 10-weeks of PT. Participants will
receive three assessments throughout, [before, after, and at 6- months]. Assessments include patient-reported
outcomes, biological markers of inflammation, and psychophysical testing [taken at each timepoint]. This
project has great potential to tailor treatment and improve future IC/BPS precision-medicine care efforts."
10847473,"Project Summary
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most promising tool for studying brain
microstructure. However, the application of dMRI to the assessment of fetal brain in-utero is challenged by
unpredictable motion, low signal-to-noise ratio, low spatial resolution, and imaging artifacts. While much effort
has been spent on improving image acquisition and motion compensation techniques, data processing and
analysis methods have remained largely unchanged. Existing biomarker estimation methods in fetal dMRI suffer
from low accuracy and low reproducibility. Moreover, cross-subject and population studies require delineation of
white matter (WM) tracts, which currently can only be performed via highly subjective and time-consuming
manual segmentation. These shortcomings have significantly limited our ability to study the brain at this critical
stage and to detect subtle changes in brain microstructure due to disorders. This proposed project will develop
and validate a new generation of methods for analysis of fetal dMRI data. Unlike existing methods, which are
based on biophysical models of the diffusion signal and mathematical model fitting, the new methods will rely on
data-driven and machine learning techniques. Building on our pioneering works that have shown the potential of
these methods, we will develop deep learning techniques for estimating microstructural biomarkers such as
fractional anisotropy, neurite orientation dispersion, and fiber orientation distribution. The new methods will be
based on two-stage transformer networks, which will be trained using dMRI data from preterm infants and
fetuses. Moreover, we will develop methods that work with undersampled scans and provide a calibrated
measure of estimation uncertainty. We will develop convolutional neural networks to segment WM tracts in the
fetal brain based on the local fiber orientations. To address the noise in the input and target labels, we will build
on our prior works on segmentation with noisy data and labels, shape-aware segmentation, and use of
uncertainty to improve segmentation accuracy. The new technique will generate tracts automatically, with tracts
that are indistinguishable from those created by the best human experts. We will evaluate the new methods
using test-retest and bootstrapping methods and via assessment by experts in fetal brain microstructure and
with histological knowledge of transient fetal fiber pathways. The new methods will enable assessment of fetal
brain microstructure and the impact of neurodevelopmental disorders on tract-specific microstructure with a level
of accuracy, detail, and reproducibility that is currently beyond reach. To definitively demonstrate the value and
significance of the new methods, we will use them to assess the alterations in WM micro-structure due to
congenital heart disease (CHD), which is the most common birth defect. In the process, we will produce the most
comprehensive and detailed picture of the impact of CHD on the fetal brain microstructure ever attempted."
10835036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle topography and perfectly align muscle morphology with the
overall body plan remain poorly understood. During embryonic development, muscle precursors known as
myotubes undergo a dramatic morphogenesis in which the myotube leading edges elongate, navigate to
tendons, and then choose pre-determined sites for muscle attachment. Myotube guidance refers to the
combined cellular processes of leading edge navigation and targeting decisions that connect muscles with the
correct tendons.
 We have used myogenesis in the Drosophila embryo as an entry point to identify the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of myotube guidance. Using forward genetic screens and genomics-based reverse genetics, we
identified multiple navigational signals that direct myotube leading edge migration, and uncovered transcription
factors that direct muscle morphogenesis. Our live imaging approaches revealed that myotubes actively
choose the correct muscle attachment site through a putative contact-dependent mechanism with tendon cells.
We hypothesize that the integrated actions of short-range navigational signals, morphogenetic gene regulatory
networks, and contact-dependent cell recognition programs direct myotube guidance to ensure muscle
topography perfectly complements the body plan.
 To achieve a comprehensive understanding of myotube guidance, we will investigate the interplay between
navigation, cell recognition, and gene regulatory modules. We propose (1) to investigate how multiple
navigational signals co-regulate the cytoskeleton to direct myotube leading edge migration, (2) to use
functional genomics to understand how a morphogenetic gene regulatory network modulates responses to
navigational signals and directs contact-dependent cell recognition, and (3) to uncover the heterophilic protein-
protein interactions between myotubes and tendon cells that establish a myotendinuos code. We expect the
foundational work proposed in this study will be a necessary first step toward understanding how navigational,
cell recognition, and gene regulatory modules cooperate to direct myogenesis in more complex systems and
human disease."
10809729,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Development of separate sexes is a fundamental process throughout vertebrates. In many species, male and
female differentiation is triggered early during embryogenesis by a master sex determination (MSD) gene that
resides on the Y chromosome. Although sex differentiation is a remarkably conserved process among
vertebrates, the MSD gene that initiates the process is incredibly variable. It remains unclear how a diverse
assortment of MSD genes integrates with the canonical vertebrate sex differentiation network. A clear
understanding of the genetic regulation of sex determination and differentiation is essential because disruptions
in this process can lead to several disorders of sexual development. Our long-term goals are to use the diverse
types of sex chromosomes among closely related species of stickleback fish to determine how anti-Müllerian
hormone (Amh) has been repeatedly co-opted into a role as an MSD gene. Work in my lab has established
stickleback fish as a premier vertebrate model system to understand how sex chromosomes and sex
determination evolves. We have identified the independent acquisition of a Y-linked Amh (Amhy) in two species
of stickleback fish that evolved through separate duplications and translocations. Our central hypothesis is that
sex-linked copies of Amh (Amhy) can elicit a similar transcriptional response in the sex differentiation network
across species. This occurs once duplicates have independently gained regulatory elements necessary for
expression during early primordial gonad development. In this proposal we will use an innovative combination of
functional genetics and comparative genomics to explore our hypothesis through three aims: (1) Determine if
Amhy is necessary and sufficient for male development in threespine and brook stickleback fish, (2) Identify how
Amhy is regulated during the time of sex determination, and (3) Characterize how the downstream sex
differentiation regulatory network responds to the acquisition of Amhy as an MSD gene. This project will have a
significant impact on the field as it will reveal the genetic mechanisms responsible for the observed plasticity in
sex determination across vertebrates. This work will also lead to broader insights into the common function of
Amh across vertebrates as a whole and will provide key genomic resources that will further enable stickleback
fish as a leading vertebrate model system to understand how sex chromosomes evolve."

Chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs) are increasingly used to attack civilians worldwide. The sarin attacks
in Tokyo and Syria and VX attack in Malaysia and England prove the real threat of CWNA. CWNA exposure
impacts human health globally, but we lack effective treatment for survivors. Until recently, preventing acute
death due to CWNA exposure was a top priority. However, addressing the long-term effects is also crucial
given that survivors of sarin attacks, though hospitalized and treated with conventional therapy, developed
seizures and cognitive, motor, and psychological impairments. Like organophosphates (OP), CWNAs are
cholinesterase inhibitors and potent seizurogenics. In animal models, acute CWNA or OP exposure induces
status epilepticus (SE) and other cholinergic symptoms. The current medical countermeasures (MCM-
atropine, oxime, and diazepam or midazolam) do not prevent long-term neurotoxicity and comorbidity, which
are primarily due to persistent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Our overarching hypothesis is
that neuroprotectant/s, in combination with MCM, will effectively counteract NA-induced long-term neurotoxicity
and restore brain function. We propose two novel neuroprotectants; saracatinib (SAR/AZD0530, a Src kinase
inhibitor) and 1400W (an inducible NO synthase inhibitor). Both demonstrated significant neuroprotective and
disease-modifying effects in kainate (KA) and DFP (a soman surrogate) rat models of chronic epilepsy. Both
tested in humans for other indications, and no adverse effects were reported. Histology of brain sections from
animal models confirmed that the test drugs significantly reduced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,
the most common features of CWNA exposure that follows SE. We had administered both drugs (separately)
and the MCM after DFP/KA/soman exposure in animals to mimic an ""after field evacuation and in-hospital""
scenario (FOA). As expected, MCM alone did not prevent DFP/KA-induced neurodegeneration, seizures, and
neurobehavioral deficits. When neuroprotectant was administered as a follow-on therapy, we could mitigate
DFP/KA/soman-induced brain pathology, which provide the proof-of-concept for the neuroprotective strategy
for a CWNA exposure scenario. We will optimize both SAR and 1400W in rat DFP and soman models and
validate in G. pig (soman) and rat VX models and determine the efficacy of single or combination of both drugs
in mitigating neuropathology and behavioral deficits [Specific Aims (SA) 1-3]. We will conduct non-GLP
PK/PD-toxicity studies and initiate drug development (SA 4) for intended use in humans (FOA). We will employ
unbiased long-term video-EEG studies to quantify seizures and epileptiform spikes, and conduct MRI/PET
scan, stereology to determine neuronal loss, and multiplex assay for neuroinflammatory cytokines. We will
conduct a battery of behavioral tests at various time-points. This research addresses the CounterACT mission,
i.e., ""to foster and support research and development of new and improved therapeutics to mitigate the health
effects of chemical threats."" The lead compound will move forward for FDA approval."
10884206,"ABSTRACT
Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is the term given to the pathological phenomenon of protein dumping from the
systemic circulation into the intestinal lumen. Various degrees of PLE are observed in a variety of otherwise
unrelated diseases. For instance, PLE is a complication of the life-saving Fontan palliation procedure performed
on children born with only a single ventricle of the heart to create a vascular diversion to the lungs to promote
improved oxygenation of blood. Fontan-associated PLE is linked with high mortality: 30-50% over 5- to 10-years.
Yet, PLE remains understudied. The dominant causal mechanisms underlying PLE appear to relate to (1) loss
of barrier integrity at the intestinal epithelium or (2) functional disturbance of the lymphatic vasculature. Intestinal
epithelial cell erosion would expose proteinaceous tissue fluid to the intestinal lumen. Furthermore, poor
epithelial intercellular junctions might allow for the contents of the lamina propria interstitium to leak into the
intestinal lumen. With respect to lymphatics, failure of lymph to flow away from the intestine uni-directionally
toward the heart and instead to flow backwards from the body trunk toward the intestine with sufficient force to
break across the epithelium may be a major cause of PLE. The literature presents Fontan palliation-associated
PLE as a problem driven by lymphatic backflow, whereas PLE in IBD (such as Crohn's disease) is presented as
being of mixed etiology that involves breach of epithelial integrity with possible additional contributions stemming
from lymphatic dysfunction. However, it is acknowledged in the literature that the full basis of PLE in any of these
conditions is uncertain and that there are several reasons why the current explanations may be questioned. We
will carry out focused research on PLE that includes studies involving human participants as well as studies in
experimental animal models. Our hypotheses are, first, that the lymphatic vasculature is a primary player in PLE
affecting Fontan patients and IBD patients, and second, that the lymphatic vasculature must receive “two hits”
to drive sufficient backflow of lymph to cause outflow from the intestinal barrier. The first of these hits has already
been considered (but not completely tested) in the context of Fontan palliation: increased pressure within the
chain of lymphangions (vessel units between lymphatic valves). We propose this second hit is an inflammatory
signal that negatively affects lymphatic valves. The two-hit model may resolve a confusing observation in Fontan
patients with PLE wherein treatments with steroids like budesonide can be effective. A steroid seems unlikely to
strongly alter pressure in the venous and lymphatic systems, but it is easy to envision how steroids may help by
reducing adverse inflammatory signalling associated with valve failure. If this model is correct, a path to therapies
not previously considered to treat PLE may become evident."

Organelle morphology is specialized for the highly adapted functions found in complex tissues. Mitochondrial
ultrastructure is exquisitely tuned to metabolic and physiological state. Abnormal morphology is a hallmark of
neurological disorders, cardiac conditions and cancer. With the cryo-EM `resolution revolution', we have
developed dramatic new understanding of membrane protein structure and regulation, but our knowledge of
organelle structure lags behind. This is due to the pleomorphic nature of organelles, and the challenge of
assigning specific morphological features to protein states. The overarching goals of my lab are to understand,
at a mechanistic level, how protein conformational change is influenced by subcellular context, how membrane
ultrastructure is regulated by protein factors, and the functional interplay of these elements in physiology and
disease. Over the next five years, my group will develop a technical platform that combines electron cryo-
microscopy (cryo-EM) and biophysical methods to study mitochondrial ultrastructure and its regulation. We will
apply our recent developed in vitro reconstitution systems to visualize reconstituted membrane proteins in
liposomes and bilayers by single-particle cryo-EM. We will mature our newly established electron cryo-
tomography (cryo-ET) pipeline for computational analyses of membrane properties to understand their
dependence on protein-protein interactions. We shall develop new structural and biophysical methods to
characterize organelle lipid heterogeneity. And finally, we will explore assembly or protein complexes in native
contexts. Together these approaches will advance mechanistic understanding of protein conformational state
and help us identify the fundamental determinants of organelle shape. We are broadly interested in questions
of membrane spacing, composition and curvature. We will develop tools precisely tailored for these questions
using mitochondria as a test bed, exploring the structure and function of candidate factors that regulate
mitochondrial membrane morphology, which play causal roles in neurodegenerative conditions. Opa1 is the
inner-membrane fusogen and cristae remodeler mutated in Dominant Optic Atrophy. SLC25A46 is an outer-
membrane member of the solute transporter family that plays important roles in coordinating lipid homeostasis
in Leigh Syndrome. MICOS is the stabilizer and regulator of cristae junctions (the `choke-point' to the
mitochondrial inner-membrane folds) whose loss results in early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy with
liver disease. This project's immediate impacts include sharing new models to understand mitochondrial shape
with cell biologists, equipping pharmacologists with new, highly specific conformational targets for therapeutic
development, and providing physiologists with fundamental rules for understanding tissue specialization. The
long-term goal is to build an extensible approach generalizable to other organelles, and a foundation for
rational control of organelle morphology from first principles."

Brain development occurs at a rapid pace prenatally and throughout childhood, impacted by dynamic genetic
and environmental influences. Studies using advanced neuroimaging have provided significant insights into
brain development but have been limited by small sample size, especially for high-risk populations. Substance-
exposed infants are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes; however, findings are inconsistent, making it
difficult to disentangle prenatal exposure effects from other adverse influences. The objectives of our HEALthy
Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Prenatal Experiences and Longitudinal Development (PRELUDE)
consortium are to characterize typical trajectories of brain development from birth through childhood,
measuring the influence of key biologic and environmental factors and their interactions on child social,
cognitive, and emotional development. We will assess how children prenatally exposed to opioids and other
substances, as well as environmental adversity, differ in those brain trajectories and outcomes. Our consortium
consists of six centers (Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Vanderbilt University) which have collaborated previously and have complementary expertise in neuroimaging,
neurophysiology, longitudinal clinical research, child development, substance exposure and addiction,
ethical/legal issues, and clinical care of high-risk infants/children. The PRELUDE consortium will recruit 680
pregnant women with substance use, 680 at-risk pregnant women without substance use, and 1360
comparison pregnant women representative of the general population to contribute to the overall HBCD study.
We will work closely with the other sites, the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core, and the HBCD Data
Coordinating Center to develop a comprehensive study protocol and ensure compliance of study workflow and
data transfer. Our consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Employ ethical and
evidence-based best practices to enroll and retain a diverse cohort of pregnant women into a longitudinal
study of infant/child brain development, oversampling mothers from high-risk backgrounds and those using
substances during pregnancy; 2) Engage a comprehensive array of maternal- and child-oriented community
stakeholders to identify community concerns and priorities regarding this research, minimize risks, and
promote long-term engagement of the recruited child-mother dyads; 3) Collect rich data to examine how
maternal health context and broader environmental factors may affect the maternal-fetal dyad and
neurodevelopment of children; 4) Capture key developmental windows during which maternal and
environmental factors may interact with brain and behavioral development of children. The insights from
these data will provide greater understanding of factors affecting early childhood brain development,
allowing targeted interventions and improved outcomes for mother-child dyads."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant
exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment,
structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child
development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of
life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To
accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed
to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented
by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the
United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-
NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be
placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco
and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a
racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2)
pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3)
demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal
inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and
protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-
modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide
novel insights into child development using state-of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public
policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation."

Despite hundreds of published articles, meta-analyses, and reviews describing the clinical syndrome of
COVID-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA), there have been zero publications to date exploring the
mechanism by which individuals with severe SARS-2 infection succumb to 2° mold infection. This proposal
seeks to evaluate the novel conceptual advancement that immune responses targeting intracellular
viral pathogens, like SARS-2, promote 2° mold infection via release of bioavailable iron, delayed
neutrophil (PMN) recruitment, and decreased antifungal effector (αFE) expression. In Aims 1-3, we
explore the hypotheses that lytic programmed cell death (PCD) in pulmonary epithelial cells (PEC) and red
blood cell hemolysis increase the availability of nutrients including iron/heme which drive siderophore-
dependent acceleration in mold growth. Concurrently, SARS-2 and the antiviral cytokine milieu mitigate PMN
recruitment and activation resulting in spore germination into large invasive hyphae that overwhelm αFE
mechanisms enabling 2° mold infection in an otherwise immunocompetent host. In Aim1, we will quantify iron,
heme, divalent cations, host metal sequestration proteins (MSP), antiviral cytokines, and PMN-recruiting
chemokines in SARS-2 BALs vs control infection cohorts (IC). We will also use immunofluorescence (IF) and
spatial transcriptomics to characterize lytic PCD, viral ORF3a-mediated cell lysis, and αFE expression in FFPE
lung tissues and utilize isogenic mutant fungi to identify critical host and microbial factors mediating mold
growth in BALs. In Aim2, we will utilize novel Calu-3 knockout (KO) cell lines and 1°normal human bronchiole
epithelial (NHBE) air liquid interface cell cultures to study the impact of the lower airway milieu and direct
SARS-2 infection on PEC: lytic PCD, IFN synthesis, αFE secretion, metal sequestration, and ability to respond
to 2° fungal stimuli. We will also utilize isogenic mutant fungi to identify critical pathways mediating mold growth
and an innovative PMN airway transmigration model to determine the impact of Type I and III IFNs, iron/heme
toxicity, and SARS-2 uptake on PMN recruitment, activation, and fungal killing. In Aim3, we will utilize novel
conditional KO mice, fluorescent viral and fungal reporter strains, IF, flow cytometry, and single cell sequencing
to assess the potential of SARS-2 variants to induce lytic PCD, define the role of lytic PCD and IFN signaling
in PECs, macrophages (Mφ), and PMNs, and evaluate their impact on lung pathology, metal release, PMN-
recruitment, spore viability, fungal growth, and infection outcome. We will also dissect key host MSP and fungal
pathways mediating mold growth, evaluate the role of Mφ and PMN hACE2 on viral and fungal clearance and
determine if small molecule inhibitors of lytic PCD, iron chelators, and siderophore biosynthesis inhibitors
prevent or mitigate the development of 2° mold infection. We believe that the results of the proposed study
will shed new light on the fundamental biology mediating CAPA and may enable the development of improved
therapeutic regimens that mitigate the risk of acquiring and succumbing to this devastating infection."

Sexual minority youth (SMY) in general, and Hispanic sexual minority youth in particular (HSMY), report higher
levels of drug use and depressive symptoms, compared to their heterosexual and sexual minority peers.
Moreover, negative health outcomes (e.g., drug use) are even higher for HSMY who disclose to parents who
are unaccepting of their sexual minority youth. In fact, youth disclosure initiates a transition process where
parents may struggle to adjust to youth being a sexual minority, potentially leading to poor family functioning
(e.g., poor communication and low family support). Further, some parents may not know how to be supportive
of their youth and adolescents may lack the needed skills to manage stress and negative reactions that may
have reverberating psychological effects. Given the impact of these co-occurring factors, it is critical to develop
and evaluate family-based preventive interventions to prevent or reduce the adverse health risks that HSMY
face. Interventions need to account for the unique experiences of HSMY and their families, including the
interplay of racism and homophobia, cultural values, family rejection/support, family functioning, and individual
level variables. Currently, there are no evidence-based, family-based preventive interventions that target drug
use and depressive symptoms among HSMY. Our team has begun work to fill this important scientific gap by
developing, pilot testing, and publishing on a family-based preventive intervention for HSMY, Familias con
Orgullo (Families with Pride). Given the promising findings for Familias con Orgullo on drug use and
depressive symptoms, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized controlled trial with 306
HSMY and their parents, the efficacy of Familias con Orgullo on preventing/reducing adolescent drug use (both
frequency and quantity) and depressive symptoms. The aims of the study are: AIM 1: Examine the efficacy of
Familias con Orgullo, compared to community practice, in decreasing past 90-day drug use (frequency and
quantity) and depressive symptoms among HSMY, over 30-months. AIM 2: Examine whether the relationship
between intervention condition and the outcomes are partially mediated by parent support for the adolescent,
parent acceptance, family functioning, adolescent stress, and sexual minority stress (e.g., discrimination).
Exploratory AIM 3: Explore whether gender and baseline levels of parent support for the adolescent, parent
acceptance, family functioning, adolescent stress, and sexual minority stress moderate intervention effects on
the youth outcomes."

 Inhibition of the DNA replication checkpoint regulator ATR is a new and promising cancer treatment. ATR
inhibitors (ATRi) function as cancer treatments by causing double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at sites of problematic
DNA replication. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that structure-forming repetitive DNA sequences
strongly influence on ATRi-driven breakage. However, our recent preliminary studies indicate that abnormal DNA
structure formation is not the sole determinant of vulnerability at these sites. We have now shown that ATRi-
driven breakage at inverted retroelement repeats is strongly stimulated by treatments that promote their
transcription. Moreover, because the transcription of retroelements is silenced at most genomic locations, their
derepression substantially increases breakage caused by ATRi.
 We hypothesize that cancer-associated alterations and silencing inhibitors that foster the transcription of
inverted retroelements will increase sensitivity to ATRi treatment. Importantly, advanced prostate cancer, most
notably castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), exhibits many features expected to cause increased
transcription of inverted retroelements. These alterations include the hypomethylation of retroelements, the loss
of RB1 and p53-mediated repeat silencing, and the abnormal processing of RNA-DNA hybrids due to RNASEH2
deficiency. Herein, we propose to determine how each of these prostate cancer-associated changes affect the
localization and number of DNA breaks induced by ATRi. Furthermore, we will explore the molecular mechanism
by which inverted retroelement transcription increases ATRi-driven breakage at select sites and determine if
further inhibition of retroelement silencing by clinically approved drugs synergizes with ATRi to suppress the
growth of tumors in mouse models of CRPC. Finally, we will determine if this combination treatment is more
effective in the context of prostate cancer-associated mutation of ATM, BRCA2 and RB1. Collectively, these
studies will characterize new mechanisms by which cancer cells are sensitized to ATRi as well as identify novel
combination treatments for CRPC."
10778624,"Sepsis is a deadly condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection which affects 700,000
patients per year in the US alone. Early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis, and infection underlying sepsis is
critical to inform treatment choices and to prevent serious organ injury and death, but diagnostic options remain
limited. This proposal addresses this unmet medical need with the development of a minimally invasive blood
test based on a multi-omics profiling of circulating cfDNA to simultaneously inform host responses, quantify organ
injury and identify infection underlying sepsis
Our recent pilot work provides significant support for the feasibility of this proposal. First, we have found that
metagenomic sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used to detect a broad range of viral and
bacterial pathogens in blood. To overcome the challenge of environmental contamination which limits the
specificity of metagenomic cfDNA sequencing we have developed Coffee-seq, a metagenomic sequencing
assay that is robust against environmental contamination. The core idea of Coffee-seq is to tag the DNA in the
sample prior to sample preparation with a label that can be recorded by DNA sequencing. Any contaminating
DNA that is introduced in the sample after tagging can then be bioinformatically identified and removed. Our
proof-of-principle work demonstrates that Coffee-seq leads to a reduction of noise due to contamination by up
to three orders of magnitude. Coffee-seq thereby dramatically improves the specificity of metagenomic
sequencing assays. Second, we have developed cfDNA assays to inform injury to host tissues and organs. This
test employs genome-wide profiling of methylation marks of cfDNA that are cell, tissue and organ-type specific
to trace their tissues-of-origin, and to quantify tissue-specific injury. We have demonstrated the utility of this
assay to identify host-tissue injury related to urinary tract infection, COVID-19, and Graft-Versus Host Disease,
a frequent complication of stem cell transplantation.
We have two aims: In Aim 1, we will test the utility of Coffee-seq to identify infection underlying sepsis with high
sensitivity and specificity. In Aim 2, we will investigate the utility of a cfDNA metagenomic sequencing assay to
inform sepsis related organ dysfunction. This is an exploratory study that tests the utility of cfDNA as a versatile
analyte to monitor sepsis. We will test this highly translational concept with a retrospective study of 300 bio-
banked samples (Cornell Biobank of Critical Illness), including 120 samples from septic patients with positive
blood culture, and 180 samples from patients with non-infectious critical illness. Successful implementation of
this study will lead to new avenues to identify infection underlying sepsis, to classify sepsis subtypes, to monitor
sepsis-related organ damage, and to guide treatment decisions."

Individuals who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often at higher risk for developing comorbid
alcohol use disorder (AUD). Studying individual differences in response to stress is important as not everyone
who experiences trauma or witnesses a traumatic event develops PTSD. In preclinical models, exposure to the
scent of a predator is commonly used for the study of PTSD-like phenotypes. During the current funding period
and in this renewal we use exposure to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) a synthetically derived
component of fox feces as the predator odor stressor. We find individual differences in stress reactivity
specifically in the engagement of digging in the bedding and immobility behavior during the TMT exposure. While
most rats engage primarily in immobility behavior (TMT-1 subgroup), we find a subset of rats engage in a high
degree of digging behavior and less immobility (TMT-2 subgroup). This TMT-2 subgroup also shows heightened
corticosterone in response to TMT, persistent escalation in alcohol self-administration, and increased TMT-
contextual conditioning whereas rats in the TMT-1 subgroup do not. Moreover, while several factors contribute
to alcohol drinking, the interoceptive effects associated with drinking are important to study as these are a key
part of the drinking experience and can drive ongoing drinking. Further, dysregulation of interoceptive processing
is a common feature in several mental health disorders, including PTSD. As such, it is important to consider that
escalations in alcohol drinking that emerge following a stressor exposure, may be related to changes in sensitivity
to the interoceptive effects of alcohol. Therefore, it is highly significant that we find potentiated sensitivity to the
interoceptive effects of alcohol (as measured in a Pavlovian drug discrimination procedure) 2 weeks after TMT
exposure, driven by the TMT-2 subgroup. We also find changes in GABAA and NMDA receptor gene expression,
primary components of alcohol interoceptive effects, in the anterior insular cortex (aIC) and the nucleus
accumbens core (AcbC), key circuitry that we have identified as underlying alcohol interoceptive effects. Lastly,
there is a growing body of PTSD literature implicating dysregulated glutamatergic systems in PTSD pathology.
We find that treatment with a metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 3 (mGlu3) negative allosteric modulator
(NAM) prior to TMT exposure attenuates some of the adaptations in GABAA and NMDA receptors. Overall, we
hypothesize that 1) decreased activity of aICAcbC projections influenced by changes in GABAA and NMDA
receptor expression, drive potentiated sensitivity to alcohol 2 weeks after TMT exposure, and 2) that mGlu3
signaling during TMT exposure contributes to these lasting changes. These innovative studies will allow for a
broader understanding of the consequences of stressor exposure on alcohol interoceptive effects, as this can
lead to a better understanding of interoceptive processing in PTSD, which may influence alcohol drinking."

 In 2005, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
established the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) to support multi-institutional
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies in critically ill children. This PL1 proposal from the
University of Utah is submitted on behalf of a newly conﬁgured CPCCRN network increased to 12 Clinical Sites
and 12 ancillary sites with > 61,000 annual ICU admissions. The expanded network has geographic, racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic diversity, and will be a platform to develop additional investigators, especially young clinician
scientists. The network will conduct a highly innovative large-scale multi-center study of personalized, targeted
immune modulation in children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The study
includes two concurrent, immunophenotype-driven placebo controlled RCTs that will address the central hypoth-
esis that individualized, pathophysiology-speciﬁc immunomodulation will improve outcomes from sepsis-induced
MODS in children. This study builds on R01-funded CPCCRN studies that have demonstrated the existence of
speciﬁc immune phenotypes among children with sepsis-induced MODS (R01GM108618 PI: Carcillo) and suc-
cessful reversal of immunosuppression by administration of the immunostimulant granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R01GM094203 PI: Hall). It also complements the ongoing NICHD R01-funded study
investigating the risk factors for immunoparalysis in pediatric MODS (R01HD095976 MPI: Hall, Zuppa).
 This application has three speciﬁc aims: (1) Implement the CPCCRN organization; (2) Mount a comprehen-
sive strategy for development of young clinician scientists and submission of rigorous proposals to fund additional
research in critical care; (3) Conduct the Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS study. The
ﬁrst trial focuses on the use of the drug GM-CSF for the reversal of immunoparalysis. The second trial uses
adaptive randomization and focuses on the drugs anakinra and tocilizumab for the targeted treatment of hyper-
inﬂammation. The primary outcome of both trials will be duration and severity of organ dysfunction using the
cumulative PELOD-2 score, and secondary outcomes will assess health related quality of life and family function-
ing at 3 and 12 months.
 The Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced MODS study represents a paradigm shift in the man-
agement of pediatric sepsis, ﬁnally moving beyond simple supportive care. We are uniquely positioned to suc-
cessfully execute this approach to personalized, real-time, pathophysiology-directed sepsis treatment, leveraging
the strengths of a diverse and highly accomplished group of investigators to deliver high-impact science to the
beneﬁt of our patients and our ﬁeld."
10890027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Poverty has a myriad of pernicious effects on health, including higher incidence and mortality for most
forms of cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second overall leading cause of cancer death, is no exception.
CRC is diagnosed 40% more often in those lower in socioeconomic status (SES). In the United States, race and
SES are inextricably linked, leading to profound health disparities. Indeed, CRC is particularly burdensome for
Black people, most notably African American men. CRC incidence is 20% higher in Black men as compared to
white men with death rates 52% higher. African American men have the lowest survival rates at all CRC stages.
 Screening (e.g., colonoscopy, stool-based tests) can prevent most cases of invasive CRC. However, uptake is
inadequate, especially among low SES African American men. Indeed, 40% of the racial disparity in CRC
incidence and 20% of mortality differences can be attributed to lack of screening. Being Black, male, and low
SES in the U.S. intersect to form a complex set of institutional, provider, and patient-level barriers that lead to
differential screening rates. Most efforts to increase CRC screening in this group utilize in-person or telephone-
based education and navigation. While effective, these approaches are resource intensive, limiting their
adoption by organizations that serve low SES Black men, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).
 To address the need for an effective, affordable, and scalable strategy to increase CRC screening among
medically underserved African American men, this project will develop a mobile colorectal cancer screening
intervention (m-CRCSI) for this group. m-CRCSI will be based on the health belief model (HBM) and delivered
via mobile phone. It will include text messages designed to improve CRC knowledge and health beliefs. Some
text messages will include links to one of three types of videos: educational instruction, scripted vignettes, and
unscripted peer narratives. Program content will reduce health literacy barriers and promote CRC screening
adherence. Finally, it will be culturally targeted by contextualizing HBM constructs with the health beliefs most
relevant to low SES Black men and by integrating gender- and race-congruent imagery, language, and values.
 A prototype m-CRCSi was developed in Phase I. This development was informed by formative research
with community-based care providers and target end-users. The results of Phase I far exceeded the proposed
benchmarks and strongly support the usability, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of the intervention.
 During Phase II we will complete development of the m-CRCSi. Then, in collaboration with Family and
Medical Counseling Service (our partner FQHC), we will examine the effectiveness of the m-CRCSi to increase
CRC screening in African American men. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention
condition or to a matched control condition. Secondary measures will assess health beliefs, medical mistrust,
cancer fatalism, patient-provider interaction, and knowledge."
10886561,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The endothelium is a crucial regulator of vascular homeostasis and endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of
cardiovascular disease. The challenge in searching for new therapies is finding early control points that prevent
the shift to broad pathologic signaling profiles and disrupt the endothelial network. Employing novel imaging and
analysis approaches, we have identified discrete patterns of dynamic Ca2+ signalling along the vascular intima
that underlie vascular function and direct the specificity, sensitivity and intensity of prevailing vascular responses.
These patterns, defined by profiles of dynamic event parameters (frequency, amplitude, duration and spatial
spread), form distinct signatures along the endothelial network. The complex spectrum of endothelial Ca2+ events
(from isolated brief transients to broad multicellular waves) result from positive feedback interaction between
plasma membrane TRP channels (Ca2+ entry) and endoplasmic reticulum IP3Rs (Ca2+ release). Small
conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) play a key role in this signaling by exerting Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization and amplifying Ca2+ influx through TRP channels (particularly fluid shear stress (FSS)-
activated TRPV4 channels). In flow-deprived distal arteries from patients with peripheral artery disease, the
endothelium exhibits a distinctive truncated Ca2+ signature characterized by spatially restricted small amplitude
transients. This anomalous Ca2+ profile appears early in a low-flow carotid ligation mouse model, giving rise to
endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodelling. These low-flow adaptations involve progressive loss of
endothelial KCa2.3 channels and suggest an early loss of cooperative KCa/TRPV4 action. We hypothesize that
disruption of TRPV4-KCa2.3 signaling under conditions of low FSS causes a progressive, highly
restricted endothelial Ca2+ signature that promotes endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling.
Aim 1 will characterize the role of TRPV4-KCa2.3 signaling in physiologic Ca2+ signatures along the arterial
endothelium. We will conduct confocal imaging (with novel high-content analysis) and employ endothelium-
specific knockout mice (ecKCa2.3-/- and ecTRPV4-/-) as well as human peripheral arteries to elucidate cooperative
channel impacts under differential FSS. Aim 2 will determine whether low/oscillatory FSS causes truncation of
the TRPV4-KCa2.3-dependent endothelial Ca2+ signature that leads to endothelial dysfunction and vascular
remodeling. We will employ a partial ligation mouse model to assess the magnitude and time course of TRPV4-
KCa2.3-specific impacts on Ca2+ signaling, vasoreactivity and vascular wall thickening. Aim 3 will determine
whether preservation of endothelial TRPV4-KCa2.3 Ca2+ signaling ameliorates development of functional and
structural vascular changes resulting from chronic low flow. We will also assess whether interventions to preserve
the Ca2+ signature directly abate pathologic impacts of low flow."
10870020,"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate Ca-induced Ca release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The
SR has discrete Ca release sites, each with a cluster of RyRs. During diastole, single -RyRs open infrequently,
but when one does, the Ca it releases may ignite localized inter-RyR CICR (a spark). Abnormally frequent or
large sparks can evoke propagating Ca waves, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death.
 RyRs operate inter-dependently at release sites. Opening of any RyR in a cluster invariably and dynamically
(spatially & temporally) alters local [Ca]’s (cytosolic & intra-SR). These [Ca] changes may activate neighboring
RyRs. The clustered RyR-geometry at release sites and the inherent positive feedback of CICR pose an ever-
present risk of evoking a Ca wave. So, fail-safe release site operation requires keeping local CICR in check. For
decades, various single RyR-level mechanisms (inactivation, adaptation, luminal Ca regulation) were proposed
to explain the paradoxical CICR stability of release sites. These single-RyR processes were ultimately found to
be insufficient. Our pilot studies indicate the reason is the required CICR negative control arises from the
collective operation of RyRs, not each RyR acting independently of one another. Collective-RyR operation at
release sites is still essentially a black box even though we know a lot about its components, from single-RyR
structure-function to sparks.
 Previous simulations importantly revealed details of “elementary” Ca release. But, these applied some strong
simplifications. For example, single-RyR gating is complex and this was just not captured in the past. Common
pool compartment models were used (and still are), where all RyRs always “see” the same [Ca], but this literally
eliminates the very phenomenon (dynamic nano-scale spatiotemporal [Ca] gradients) that drives collective-RyR
operation at release sites. Thus, our foundational principle is, as we have the parts needed, we must meticulously
assemble them without the unrealistic assumptions of the past. To this end, we developed an innovative hybrid
experimental/computational approach. Our pilot studies have already revealed previously unknown collective-RyR
CICR control mechanisms like pernicious attrition (which helps terminates CICR), RyR recruitment bias (that works
to shrink inter-RyRCICR events) and long-closed resistance(whichlimits the local spread of CICR within arelease
site). The hypothesis tested here is: The normal fail-safe stability and arrhythmogenic instability of diastolic SR Ca
release sites are governed by collective-RyR control mechanisms that can be therapeutically manipulated by RyR-
targeted drugs. And, the specific aims are 1) Identify collective-RyR control mechanisms that promote the
diastolic stability normal human ventricular SR Ca release sites and 2) Define collective-RyR control at human
arrhythmogenic diastolic release sites and test RyR-targeted drugs as potential therapeutic collective control
stabilizers. This study will provide a strong mechanistic foundation for understanding collective -RyR operation at
SR Ca release sites and so promises to transform our knowledge of arrhythmogenic SR Ca release sites."
10889198,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of normal endothelial cell (EC) function plays a critical role in vascular homeostasis and the
prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endothelial dysfunction in CVD is characterized by loss of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-derived nitric oxide (NO). The Tie receptors and their ligands, the
angiopoietins (Ang), are important regulators of vascular homeostasis and the transition from EC quiescence
to ""activation"" and vascular remodeling. Whereas Ang-1/Tie2 signaling promotes EC survival and quiescence,
in part through activation of Akt and eNOS, the homologous Tie1 receptor has been shown to promote EC
activation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. However, Tie1 is also required for Tie2-mediated angiogenesis,
and Tie1's overall functional effects appear to be context-dependent and linked, in part, to the presence of
inflammation. Unlike Tie2, Tie1 has no known activating ligands, therefore its signaling pathways and
mechanisms of action have been difficult to study and remain poorly understood. We identified a novel and
previously uncharacterized molecular scaffolding protein, Caskin2, as a Tie1-interacting protein. Although few
studies have specifically addressed Caskin2's function, it has been identified as a strong marker of ECs, and
numerous molecular studies have linked Caskin2 to phenotypes associated with defects in vascular
homeostasis. Importantly, our studies indicate that Caskin2 is a critical molecular link between Tie receptor
signaling, eNOS biology, and vascular homeostasis. Our preliminary studies in this proposal demonstrate that
Caskin2 is highly expressed in ECs in vitro and in vivo and that Caskin2 promotes EC quiescence and survival
in vitro. Caskin2 binding to Tie1 is disrupted by phosphorylation of T794 on Tie1, an event that is mediated by
PAK in a Rac-dependent manner and that is required for angiogenesis. Moreover, Caskin2 is required for Ang-
1/Tie2-mediated signaling through Akt, suggesting that Caskin2 integrates signals from both Tie1 and Tie2 to
regulate vascular homeostasis. Furthermore, Caskin2 binds eNOS and its activator calmodulin (CaM) and
increases eNOS expression and activity and is upregulated by fluid shear stress and by KLF2. Finally, we
show that Caskin2–/– mice have increased vascular permeability, atherosclerosis, pathological angiogenesis,
and are hypertensive, all disorders of vascular homeostasis characterized by abnormal eNOS signaling. Based
on these findings, we hypothesize that Caskin2 is a critical integrator of Tie receptor signaling that
regulates vascular homeostasis in part through eNOS activation. To test this hypothesis, the Specific
Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which Caskin2 regulates Tie
receptor-mediated endothelial function and eNOS activity; 2) Determine the mechanisms by which Caskin2
responds to and senses changes in fluid shear stress to regulate EC phenotypes in vitro; and 3) Determine the
effects of Caskin2 deficiency on vascular homeostasis in vivo."
10897210,"Biomolecular condensates concentrate select groups of macromolecules into discrete foci in eukaryotic cells
in the absence of a surrounding membrane. Condensates are found throughout eukaryotic cells, and function
in processes ranging from signal transduction to RNA metabolism to gene expression. Aberrant condensates
have been implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer and skin diseases. Our understanding of eukaryotic cell
organization was transformed by the discovery that many condensates appear to form through liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS) of multivalent macromolecules. My lab played an important part in this discovery by
establishing key principles, including the essential role of multivalent interactions in promoting biological
LLPS, the regulation of LLPS by covalent modifications, and the ability of LLPS to increase enzymatic
activity. In recent years, we showed that and how LLPS can produce membrane-associated clusters that
increase the specific activity of signaling molecules. We also showed that intrinsically disordered regions of
proteins (IDRs) can undergo LLPS to produce liquid droplets that harden to solids over time, likely due to
formation of amyloid filaments, and that misregulated hardening may contribute to neurodegeneration.
Further, we proposed the first model to explain condensate composition based on a scaffold/client framework.
Most recently, we showed that chromatin has an intrinsic propensity to undergo LLPS, providing a new view
of eukaryotic genome organization. Here, we propose a broad program to address leading questions in the
biomolecular condensate field. We will use microfluidics to assess LLPS of thousands of IDRs in a single
experiment, leading to a predictive model for the sequence determinants of LLPS and amyloid formation by
IDRs. This work will deepen our biophysical understanding of these processes, predict which IDRs are likely
to contribute to specific biological processes (e.g. transcription) through self-assembly, and reveal how IDR
mutations lead to disease through amyloid formation. We will also examine how individual components of
yeast P bodies impact the LLPS threshold and composition of the compartments and how RNA helicase and
RNA decapping activities are modulated within them. This work will lead to a new model of condensate
composition based on the patterns of interaction between components, and will explain how composition and
encapsulation can control enzymatic activities in native condensates. Finally, we will learn how
internucleosome spacing and diverse histone post-translational modifications control chromatin LLPS to
generate biochemically and functionally distinct genomic regions, examine whether NUT carcinoma is caused
by defective LLPS, and develop a new approach to drug design based on targeting small molecules to
condensates. Together, the work will reveal new principles of biological phase separation, explain how phase
separation can be used to control RNA metabolism and genome organization and function, and provide insights
into the mechanisms and potential treatments of neurodegeneration and cancer."
10894770,"Abstract
Military veterans in the U.S. represent one of the populations most disproportionately impacted by the current
opioid crisis. With historically high rates of injury and opioid analgesic use to treat chronic pain, veterans were
widely prescribed opioids (often in conjunction with benzodiazepines) during the early years of the epidemic,
and have been at elevated risk of opioid-related overdose and HIV/HCV infection since. Further, current data
on opioid-related harms affecting veterans are likely to understate the severity of the situation, as most studies
of veterans focus on the less than 50% of veterans who use VA healthcare facilities. Veterans who use opioids
and are not connected to the VA healthcare system have high rates of homelessness and experience higher
prevalence of comorbid substance use disorder and mental health diagnoses than their “service-connected”
counterparts. Due to these vulnerabilities and the observed barriers to testing and treatment among veterans—
especially substance- and mental health-related stigma, drug naiveté, and limited support networks—veterans
who use opioids represent a critical target for interventions designed to mitigate overdose and HIV/HCV risk
behaviors. For socially isolated veterans and veterans with limited access to healthcare, programs that work
outside of formal healthcare institutions and agencies are desperately needed. This application proposes to
advance scientific understanding of the most potent and efficient way to prevent opioid-related harms among
veterans by achieving the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-delivered, community-based
education, navigation and support (CENS) intervention to reduce opioid-related risk behaviors; 2) Examine
factors that mediate (e.g., knowledge, self-efficacy, self-stigma) and moderate (e.g., mental health, pain/OUD
severity, age) intervention effectiveness; and 3) Explore intervention participants’ and peer outreach staff
perspectives on implementation as well as barriers to and facilitators of intervention effectiveness. The
proposed intervention will be delivered by three veteran peer outreach workers—one dedicated to each of the
three main intervention components (Education, Navigation, and Support). The study will recruit 300 veterans
with opioid use disorder to participate in a randomized controlled trial. The CENS intervention will engage 150
participants in ongoing educational sessions, healthcare and treatment navigation, and social support
(involving both one-on-one and group social integration protocols) designed to improve self-efficacy, reduce
self-stigma, increase service and healthcare utilization, and bolster knowledge. This study stands to contribute
a timely, culturally-tailored innovation to overdose and HIV/HCV prevention-as-usual that, informed by the
theory of triadic influence, directly confronts the social, intrapersonal, and structural-level barriers to opioid-
related risk reduction among veterans. Study findings will be of great interest to community-based and civic
healthcare organizations that provide overdose and HIV/HCV risk reduction outreach, as well as to agencies
committed to improving healthcare engagement among veterans."

Exposures to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), especially during early life, are strongly
linked to adverse health outcomes including neurobehavioral, reproductive, and other endocrine dysfunctions.
EDC exposures to a fetus (F1) also exposes the germline and causes heritable epigenetic changes that are
passed to future generations. There are a number of limitations to prior work that I will overcome in the current
RIVER application. Most EDC research is limited to a single tissue type or a single mechanism with a limited
number of targets. This is particularly complicated in the brain because of its heterogeneity. The field is also
limited by a surprisingly small number of studies that compare sex differences, yet EDCs have profoundly
different effects on the developing male and female brain, body, and germline, which are subject to sex-specific
epigenetic programming and therefore sex-specific phenotypes. Finally, how epigenetic programming
propagates from gamete to somatic cells and causes tissue-specific diseases such as neurobehavioral disorders
is a fundamental question, one that (to my knowledge) has never been addressed. This RIVER application has
three overarching areas of inquiry. 1) What are the epigenetic mechanisms by which environmental EDCs
organize brain development at the cellular level, and lead to functional neurobiological deficits in exposed
individuals? 2) Which epigenetic mechanism(s) is responsible for programming of the germline to enable
transmission across generations? 3) How does epigenetic programming in the germline manifest as cell-specific
phenotypes in somatic cells (e.g. brain)? To address these questions we will use our established rat EDC
exposure model with human-relevant chemicals, dosages, and route, in which direct (F1), intergenerational (F2),
and multigenerational (F3) work will be performed in both the brain and the gametes. I am uniquely qualified to
lead this research program as an environmental neuroendocrinologist doing groundbreaking multigenerational
epigenetic work. We will do single-cell multiomic profiling of both the brain and gametes at the RNA, DNA, and
small-noncoding RNA (sncRNA) level, enabling us to pinpoint the cell types influenced by EDCs, and how
phenotypes are propagated from gametes to individuals and across developmental stages. Established
bioinformatic pipelines will inform on these mechanisms individually, as well as their relationships. Crucially, the
lines of work in brain and gametes will be connected by relating epigenomic profiles in brain and germ cells to
one another, thereby determining how epigenomic marks in gametes are reflected in the brain. These data will
establish definitive epigenetic profiles that will allow us to identify the origin of EDC induced epigenetic
modifications and provide potential targets for therapeutics in humans, with which the mechanisms studied in
rats are highly conserved. The flexibility and security of the RIVER program is necessary to fully realize the
promise of this likely paradigm-shifting research."

 Synaptic plasticity is well accepted as the basis of behavioral adjustability in the face of a constantly
changing environment. Our lived experience is transmitted to our brain as electrical impulses along axons.
Oligodendrocytes (OLs) increase the rate at which these electrical impulses are transmitted by insulating
axons with myelin sheaths. Surprisingly, motor learning, sensory stimulation, and social enrichment induce the
differentiation of precursor cells into myelinating OLs resulting in quantifiable structural changes in white
matter. These findings point to myelin plasticity as a concurrent, and equally important contributor to the
adaptability of neural circuits. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying myelin plasticity are
not well understood.
 Single OLs can give rise to sheaths of different lengths and thicknesses to accommodate the needs of
diverse axons. These observations suggest a local and independent regulation of myelination at the level of
individual sheaths. How do sheaths assess the needs of specific axons? Action potentials cause axons to, not
only release vesicles at their terminal ends, but also along their shafts. Our lab and others have shown that
axons signal to myelin sheaths via these alternative release sites and that myelin sheaths express the
canonical post-synaptic factors required to interpret these signals. These data suggest that the use of a shared
transmission machinery enables synaptic and myelin plasticities to occur in parallel as a response to the same
stimulus.
 While some components of axo-myelin communication have been elucidated, the intracellular
mechanisms bridging signal receipt to myelin production remain unknown. In dendrites, the localization of
mRNA transcripts and ribosomes to individual spines support their rapid, tailored adaptive responses.
Similarly, diverse groups of mRNAs, along with ribosomes localize to myelin sheaths raising the possibility that
local RNA translation underlies the ability of individual OL sheaths to fine-tune their responses to signals from
various axons. Due to the dynamic nature of RNA translation, it would be best understood if studied in vivo.
However, limitations in technological approaches stood in the way for decades. Using diverse transgene
expression systems, protein photoconversion technology, and my expertise with 2-photon laser severing, I will
determine if local translation of myelin-resident transcripts occurs in zebrafish. Additionally, I will investigate
whether the myelin localization of an enriched group of transcripts we identified contributes to myelin plasticity.
To accomplish this, I will create a loss-of-function mutation of Khdrbs1, an RNA binding protein predicted to
bind to members of this enriched group. Finally, I will test if manipulating neuronal activity alters the translation
of targeted myelin resident mRNAs. This work will add to our understanding of how axo-myelin exchanges
impact the efficiency of neuronal circuits by providing new insights into the kinetics of local translation in vivo."
10891748,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This study focus on the optimal functional and structural imaging characterization of the cognitive aging and
preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been repeatedly demonstrated that performance across the age
span on large batteries of diverse cognitive tests can be parsimoniously represented by a set of four reference
abilities: episodic memory, perceptual speed, fluid ability, and vocabulary. In contrast, neuroimaging
researchers typically evaluate age differences in neural activation associated with the performance of a single
specific task that may or may not be fully representative of these reference abilities. Successful identification of
these ""reference ability neural networks"" may lead to a paradigm shift in research on the neural bases of age
differences in cognition by focusing on the broad and replicable aspects common to several tasks rather than
the possibly idiosyncratic features of individual tasks. We have identified the latent brain networks associated
with each of the four reference abilities across adulthood. While undergoing functional imaging, we tested large
group of healthy adults aged 20 to 80 with a series of 12 cognitive tasks that represent the four reference
abilities (3 per construct). Using unique expertise in spatial covariance and other analyses of the fMRI imaging
data, we have derived 4 latent spatial, brain-wide fMRI networks that are associated with the latent cognitive
structure of the reference abilities across adulthood. We are presently following up this group at 5 years and
beginning to delineate how expression of these networks changes with aging and with the onset of mild
cognitive impairment and AD. We use multimodal imaging to evaluate potential mediators of age and
dementia-related differences in the utilization of the networks. These include change in brain volume, cortical
thickness, white matter hyperintensity burden; integrity of white matter tracts; resting CBF; and resting BOLD
networks. Importantly, we use PET to assess amyloid and tau burden. We now propose to extend the follow up
of this important cohort to 10 years. The proposed study develops a completely new imaging approach to the
study of cognitive aging and preclinical AD and is also unique in its age span. It has the potential to provide key
insights into the nature and causes of the neural changes that underlie cognitive aging and to more accurately
describe the preclinical phase of AD."
10830454,"For the millions of individuals living with eating disorders (EDs), food-avoidance and -seeking have become debilitating and potentially life-threatening behaviors. If we are to improve treatments and identify novel therapeutics for EDs, it is absolutely critical that we understand brain circuits that calibrate feeding and interpret food-related contextual cues. The hippocampus (HPC) is critically involved in the contextual regulation of motivated behaviors, including feeding, but how contextual signals of the HPC are integrated and relayed to subcortical systems to scale motivated behaviors isn't well known. Leveraging deep molecular and circuit analyses, including single-cell sequencing, optogenetics, and monosynaptic neural tracing, we have uncovered a dorsally restricted subpopulation of LS neurons, characterized by its unique expression pattern of the neuropeptide, prodynorphin (Pdyn). Critically, and in male and female mice, these LS(Pdyn) neurons receive robust monosynaptic input from the dorsal HPC (e.g., CA3/2) and project strongly to feeding-related regions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Our preliminary data suggest that LS(Pdyn) neurons exhibit an inhibitory role on feeding. These findings concord with a food-seeking model in which inhibitory LS(Pdyn) neurons reduce food approach and eating by inhibiting food-seeking GABAergic LH(Vgat) neurons. As such, the proposed work will test the central hypothesis that a top-down excitatory dorsal HPC->dorsal LS(Pdyn)->LH(Vgat) circuit mediates context-dependent-regulation of food reward-seeking behavior. Accordingly, and in Aim 1 (spanning the first year of training under the K99 phase), we will deploy longitudinal 1-p calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to test the hypothesis that LS(Pdyn) neural activity negatively correlates with food approach and consumption, and that this activity can be deciphered to discriminate food-associated contexts (that promote feeding) from those that do not. In Aim 2 (in the final phase of the K99 period), we will characterize functional synaptic connectivity between excitatory hippocampal inputs to LS(Pdyn) inhibitory neurons, and we will test for the dependence of context-dependent feeding on hippocampal inputs to the dorsolateral septum [the region in which LS(Pdyn) neurons are expressed] using circuit-specific optogenetics. In the final Aim 3, and in the establishment of my own independent research program (in years 3-5 of the R00 stage), I will implement the techniques established in Aims 1 and 2 to test whether LS(Pdyn) inhibitory neurons synapse onto inhibitory LH(Vgat) neurons and whether this circuit is critical for the context-dependent expression of food reward-seeking (circuit-specific optogenetics). Moreover, Aim 3 will test whether LH(Vgat) neurons are inhibited in vivo following LS(Pdyn) activation (combining cell-type-specific optogenetics of the LS and longitudinal calcium imaging in the LH), directly linking LS(Pdyn) neural activity to the LH for regulation of context-triggered feeding. In total, these studies will identify how dorsal LS(Pdyn) activity patterns encode and deploy environmental signals for the contextual calibration of motivated feeding behaviors."
10833150,"Pterygium is a raised wedge-shaped fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva that migrates into the transparent
cornea. Pterygium causes significant discomfort and can lead to a decline in vision through induction of
irregular astigmatism and obstruction of visual axis. The exact molecular mechanism leading to pterygium
formation and progression is unknown. Consequently, there are no available medical therapies available for
pterygium prevention or treatment. Inflammation biomarkers are upregulated in pterygium, and ultraviolet (UV)
exposure is the most significant risk factor for pterygium formation. However, the mechanism by which UV
exposure leads to inflammation, and whether an inflammatory response plays a causative role in pterygium
progression is unknown. Our preliminary data based on analysis of human pterygium samples and normal
conjunctiva demonstrate evidence of activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling in human pterygia that is
coupled with de-repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). ERVs are viral retroelements that have
integrated into the human genome, and their transcriptional de-repression has been associated with increased
cellular inflammation through the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and DNA (dsDNA), leading to
the activation of the dsRNA and dsDNA sensors, RIG-I/MDA5/MAVS and the cGAS-STING innate immune
pathways, respectively. Aberrant and dysregulated activation of cell-intrinsic, innate immune pathways has
been implicated in cellular migration and proliferation through activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. In
this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that chronic UVB exposure induces transcriptional de-
repression of ERVs in conjunctival cells leading to increased cellular proliferation and migration through
activation of the cGAS–STING pathway and downstream non-canonical NF-κB signaling. This hypothesis will
be tested using two independent aims. Under Aim 1, we will test the epistatic dependency of the migratory
phenotype of pterygium-derived cells on non-canonical NF-κB signaling, which has been implicated in
mediating a migratory and invasive phenotype in cancer models. We will establish pterygium-derived cells
obtained from surgical specimens at our clinical practice. Under Aim 2, we will determine whether chronic UVB
exposure leads to upregulation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling, and test whether activation of non-canonical
NF-κB signaling is mediated by de-repression of ERVs and downstream cGAS-STING activation. By utilizing
genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of key components of the cGAS-STING and non-canonical NF-κB
signaling pathways, we seek to establish a mechanistic link between UVB exposure and a migratory
phenotype. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
pterygium formation and progression, and identify molecular targets that are amenable to pharmacologic
intervention. The Principal Investigator is an Assistant Professor at Yale University and runs an independent
laboratory. Our team has the clinical expertise and the resources to complete the proposed experiments."
10811773,"The physician-scientist workforce persistently fails to reflect the racial and ethnic composition of both the United
States' (U.S.) general population and medical schools. There is growing attention in medical education to the
importance of professional identity formation, defined as the development of values, beliefs, aspirations, and
sense of affiliation aligned with the norms of the profession. There is evidence that experiences during medical
school play a critical role in shaping physician-scientist professional identity formation, and that these
experiences differ between underrepresented in medicine (URiM) and non-URiM students. Yet little is known
about training practices and organizational characteristics of medical schools with the greatest success in
equitable physician-scientist professional identity formation among URiM medical students, including Blacks,
Hispanic/Latinx Americans, and Native Americans.
We propose a multi-stage mixed methods study to identify the training practices and organizational
characteristics of MD programs with greatest success in equitable physician-scientist professional identity
formation among URiM single-degree medical students, relative to non-URIM students. This objective will be
achieved through the following specific aims: 1) use data from the Association of American Medical Colleges
[AAMC] Graduation Questionnaire [GQ] to identify MD programs which consistently demonstrate greatest and
least success in equitable physician-scientist professional identity formation among URiM medical students
relative to non-URiM students; 2) develop hypotheses about best practices and organizational characteristics for
promoting equitable physician-scientist professional identity formation by conducting in-depth qualitative
interviews at MD programs demonstrating the greatest and least success in equitable physician-scientist
professional identity formation, and; 3) evaluate associations between practices and organizational
characteristics identified in Aim 2 and consistent equity in physician-scientist professional identity formation
through a national survey to identify best practices and characteristics that are broadly applicable to U.S. MD
programs.
This study is significant because it will provide information that can inform efforts to enhance the racial and ethnic
diversity of the physician-scientist workforce. Our primary outcome of institution-level equity in physician-scientist
development between URiM and non-URiM students is innovative and practical. Whereas rates of physician-
scientist development may differ between MD programs, due to characteristics such as research intensity of the
school, disparities in rates of physician-scientist development between non-URiM and URiM students within MD
programs signal potential issues regarding egalitarian distribution of resources and discriminatory practices.
Dissemination will take the form of scholarly publications and real-world communications (toolkit, website,
podcasts, etc.) in partnership with high-profile national organizations, e.g., AAMC, for maximal impact."
10888294,"We have one overarching goal: Train postdoctoral fellows who will be qualified and well-positioned to
lead in the development and application of next generation technologies to understand the
heterogenous and changing cellular and molecular landscape of cancers. Specifically, we propose to
continue a 2-3 year postdoctoral fellowship that will attract the best and brightest individuals with a strong
commitment to transdisciplinary research from a wide variety of backgrounds including engineering, biological,
chemical and computational sciences to help build the next generation of scientific leaders in multiplexed
cancer analysis. Cellular cancer diagnostics are essential in establishing the correct diagnosis, guiding the
appropriate treatment, assessing patient eligibility into clinical trials, determining therapeutic efficacy, re-staging
disease and understanding cancer heterogeneity at a systems level. Bringing together the tools of imaging,
artificial intelligence (AI) based image analysis, cellular analyses, cancer genomics, computer science, and
immunology will be necessary to solve problems in oncology and find innovative solutions that can expand the
number of cancer patients who will benefit from conventional, targeted and immunotherapies. We provide high
quality trainees with a period of funding so they can be exposed to: a) carefully mentored research experiences
during periods of increasing autonomy to conduct and effectively communicate transdisciplinary research; b)
optimal didactic experiences; c) the most innovative and cutting-edge tools and thinking with which to attack
these problems and d) broad exposure to the most pressing cancer problems today through interactions in a
rich cancer center environment. We have an outstanding track record of success: our fellows have produced
388 papers in peer reviewed journals. Of the 49 postdoctoral fellows who have completed training, 47 are in
research and 26 (52%) are already professors. The faculty of 34 extraordinary mentors has been carefully
selected on the basis of their demonstrated commitment to the independence of their trainees, exciting and
important biologic problems on which to work, and stable funding. The faculty are all highly accomplished and
collectively receive over 200 extramural research grants. More recently, the training program has been
considerably strengthened by a) expanded thematic programs (e.g. systems pharmacology, drug delivery,
immunotherapies, single cell analyses), b) new lecture series, c) an expanded bioengineering facility. With our
current faculty, enhanced facilities, scope of supported research and past accomplishments, we offer an
outstanding research environment for the next generation of clinicians and scientists to be trained in molecular
imaging and systems analysis."
10891391,"Project Summary
The broad goal of this project is to determine whether restricting meal timing to the biological day shows
beneficial effects on metabolic markers of health, which holds great translational value for vulnerable populations
such as night shift workers. Shift work increases the risk for diabetes, which cannot be fully explained by
differences in life style and socioeconomic status. We have demonstrated that misalignment between the central
circadian clock and the behavioral sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycle, typical in night shift workers, leads to
adverse metabolic changes, which may help explain the increased diabetes risk in night workers. Animal data
show similar adverse metabolic effects of circadian misalignment and further show that normalizing the circadian
food timing prevents these adverse effects. In humans, our preliminary data from a stringently-controlled
circadian experiment suggest that restricting meal timing to the biological day can mitigate the glucoregulatory
consequences of circadian misalignment. However, while our unpublished preliminary data show a proof-of-
principle for restricting food intake to the biological day, this has limited translational value, because meal times
were required to be given during the sleep episodes, which is clearly not advisable to chronic shift workers.
Therefore, a key gap that will be addressed in the current application is testing whether restriction of meal timing
to the biological day - without disrupting sleep - can mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of circadian
misalignment, as compared to when the same individuals have their meals scheduled during their night work
shift (Specific Aim 1). To achieve this goal, we will simulate realistic night shifts in laboratory with meals
scheduled during the biological night (control protocol) or with meals restricted to the biological day (intervention
protocol) using a highly-controlled, within-subject, randomized, crossover design. In addition, common genetic
variants in the melatonin receptor gene, MTNR1B, confers diabetes risk, playing a key role in the circadian
organization of melatonin and glucoregulation. Thus, we will also examine whether the common MTNR1B
genetic variants modulate the effects of meal timing on glucoregulation (Specific Aim 2). Last, intestinal
microbiota plays a key role in metabolic health, and its disruption has been observed under circadian
misalignment. Therefore, we plan to test whether restricting meal timing to the biological day can mitigate its
disruption (Specific Aim 3), which may alleviate the deleterious metabolic consequences of circadian
misalignment. This study will help uncover potential mechanisms underlying the adverse metabolic effects of
circadian misalignment and will aid in the development of novel interventions based on meal timing for night shift
work and other circadian rhythm disturbances."
10754296,"The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is higher in Veterans compared to the general
populace and the occurrence is increased further in Veterans with spinal cord injury. Thus, OSA
is a major health concern in the Veteran population. Adjustments in the neural modulation of the
arousal threshold (AT), chemoreflex sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia (CS) and upper
airway patency are three critical factors that contribute to exacerbation of sleep apnea. The
exact neuromodulators that control these variables are enigmatic, but one possibility is
serotonin (5HT) and its target receptors. Thus, plasticity of 5HT neurons may account for
modifications in the AT, CS, upper airway patency and ultimately breathing stability in intact and
spinal cord injured (SCI) animals. We are exploring the role of 5HT in modulating those factors
that exacerbate sleep apnea in intact and SCI mice.
If not treated promptly, OSA may result in autonomic, cardiovascular, neurocognitive and
metabolic abnormalities. Treatment of OSA in many cases does not lead to significant
improvements in outcome measures. This inadequacy may be a consequence of reduced
treatment compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or because factors
other than those directly linked to sleep apnea contribute to the presence of coincident co-
morbidities. Consequently, innovative therapies that increase CPAP compliance and/or directly
impact those co-morbidities typically associated with OSA independent of CPAP treatment
could improve outcomes linked to sleep apnea. My laboratory has established that mild
intermittent hypoxia (MIH) initiates sustained increases in chest wall and upper airway muscle
activity in humans. This sustained increase is a form of respiratory plasticity known as long-term
facilitation (LTF). Repeated daily exposure to MIH that leads to the initiation of LTF of upper
airway muscle activity could lead to increased stability of the upper airway. In line with my
laboratory's mandate to develop innovative therapies to treat sleep apnea, this increased
stability could ultimately reduce the CPAP required to treat OSA. This reduction, coupled with
our published findings which showed that exposure to MIH increases the arousal threshold,
could lead to improved compliance with CPAP. Improved compliance could ultimately serve to
mitigate those co-morbidities linked to sleep apnea. Moreover, in addition to improving CPAP
compliance, numerous studies indicate that MIH has many direct beneficial cardiovascular,
neurocognitive and metabolic effects. Thus, we are presently exploring if MIH can be used to
both directly and indirectly (via improved CPAP compliance) target and mitigate those co-
morbidities linked to sleep apnea."
10893954,"Project Summary/Abstract
Child maltreatment (CM) is a pervasive public health problem and there is a critical need for brief, effective,
scalable prevention interventions. Problematic parent-child relationships lie at the heart of CM. Parents who
maltreat their children are more likely to have punitive parenting styles characterized by high rates of negative
interaction and ineffective discipline strategies with over-reliance on punishment. Harsh, reactive parenting can
contribute to the development of child behavioral problems which, in turn, can increase parental stress and
lead to escalation of negative parenting behaviors, including abusive and neglectful parenting. Thus, parenting
interventions that strengthen parent-child relationships, teach positive discipline techniques, decrease harsh
parenting, and decrease child behavioral problems hold promise as CM prevention strategies. Challenges in
engaging parents, particularly low-income and minority parents, and a lack of knowledge regarding effective
implementation strategies, however, have greatly limited the reach and impact of parenting interventions. To
address these challenges, our interdisciplinary team from the University of North Carolina and Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia collaborated in implementing and evaluating, Child Adult Relationship Enhancement in
Primary Care (PriCARE)/Criando Niños con Cariño. PriCARE/Cariño is distinct from other programs because it
was (1) developed and iteratively adapted with input from racially and ethnically diverse families, including low-
income families and (2) designed specifically for implementation in primary care with inclusion of strategies to
align with usual-care work flow to increase uptake and retention. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
PriCARE has demonstrated success in engaging parents, promoting positive parenting, reducing parent stress,
and improving child behaviors. The objective of this project “Child-Adult Relationship Enhancement in Primary
Care: Effectiveness Trial of a Primary Care Based Parenting Intervention to Prevent Child Maltreatment” is to
conduct a multi-site RCT of PriCARE/Cariño plus Usual Care vs. Usual Care among 1932 parents and their 2-
6-year-old children with Medicaid/CHIP/no insurance from 6 clinics. We will examine the effectiveness of
PriCARE/Cariño on reducing suspected CM, in addition to reducing proximal CM related outcomes (child
behavior problems, parent stress, harsh/neglectful parenting). By testing proximal outcomes in addition to the
more distal outcome of CM, this study will help to elucidate the mechanisms of change and advance the
science of CM prevention. Finally, in this study we will also identify PriCARE/Cariño implementation
determinants and examine their relationship to implementation outcomes. If successful, results will be used to
seek funding from state agencies and payers to sustain PriCARE/Cariño in primary care, while continuing to
refine and study implementation and dissemination strategies, with the ultimate goal of achieving levels of
exposure sufficient for breaking the intergenerational transmission of CM. Inclusion of consent for longitudinal
data collection will facilitate future longitudinal studies of the impact of PriCARE/Cariño on additional outcomes."

The Career Enhancement Core will focus on recruiting, training, and mentoring the careers of trainees,
including pre-doctoral fellows, post-doctoral fellows, and new and early-stage investigators, as independent
investigators focused on tobacco regulatory science (TRS) and the reduction of tobacco-related health
disparities. Consistent with the UNC TCORS theme, we will focus on skill acquisition key to building the
science for effective regulation of, and communication about, tobacco products disproportionately used by
priority populations, especially flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes. The Core will facilitate
comprehensive mentored research and training experiences annually for 4-8 pre-doctoral fellows, 4 post-
doctoral fellows (one for each research project), and 2 new and early-stage investigators. Experiences will
include participating in research projects, grant writing, monthly trainings, meetings, seminars and

10827522,"Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative disease in older adults with the incidence rising rapidly
after age 50 and leveling off after age 70. OA is also one of the common causes of chronic pain and the
leading cause of physical disability in older adults. Currently, there is an unmet need for therapeutic strategies
to improve the outcome for patients with OA. Our latest work identifies a list of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human
cartilage and demonstrates a strong association with a robust anabolic effect. This effect is joint-specific and
follows a distal-proximal axis gradient (high in ankle and low in hip). Studies show that a joint's identity is
maintained by synovial cells and that there is a distinct miRNA profile in different joints. Together, this suggests
that the miRNAs we identified in cartilage may originate from synovium and be involved in maintaining joint
homeostasis. In Aim 1, I will determine the synovial cell types that express these regenerative miRNAs within
human joints and the effects of age on the expression of these miRNAs. In Aim 2, I will determine the signaling
pathways responsible for the miRNA-mediated anabolic effects in cartilage and the effects of age on these
pathways. I will conduct gene set enrichment analysis to determine miRNA-mediated pathways and then use
proteomics to validate these pathways. Through this project, I will determine the miRNA-mediated mechanisms
by which synovial cells promote endogenous anabolic effects in the human joint. The key career enhancement
of this award will be the training in computational bioinformatics to analyze the complex datasets generated by
the project, and further training in aging biology to understand how aging impacts the regeneration process. To
facilitate progress toward independence, the training plan will include the coursework/workshops in
computational bioinformatics and aging biology, extensive internal and external scientific meetings, and career
professional development activities and mentorship. The research and career development plan detailed in this
proposal will be conducted with a team of outstanding mentors. Dr. Yi-Ju Li, a professor of Biostatistics &
Bioinformatics and an expert in statistics and bioinformatics, will serve as the primary mentor and focus on the
training in bioinformatics, statistics, and professional skill development. Drs. Cathleen Colón -Emeric, Virginia
Kraus (Duke), and Patrik Önnerfjord (Lund University, Sweden) will serve as co-mentors; they will facilitate
training in translational aging research, OA research, and proteomics, respectively. The environment at the
Duke University and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, where the main research activities are located, are
ideal for the research and training activities outlined in this proposal. This award will enable me to elucidate the
novel contributions of miRNAs to joint tissue homeostasis. Advancements in this area of research have the
potential to develop as new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with OA."
10876296,"Project summary
Post-acute care (PAC) is common, and costly, and may not lead to optimal health outcomes for older adults.
However, it is unknown how to improve outcomes and/or lower costs, or value, of PAC. More than 40% of
Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries receive PAC after hospitalization, predominantly in skilled nursing
facilities (SNFs) and by home health (HH) agencies, at a cost of more than $60 billion annually. Unfortunately,
around 1 in 4 is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge to PAC, and nearly half of beneficiaries
in SNF fail to return to the community within 100 days of hospital discharge. The rapid expansion of Medicare
Advantage (MA) provides an opportunity to evaluate a different approach to PAC utilization. More than one-
third of all Medicare beneficiaries are now enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which receive capitated
payments and take financial risk for the care needs of beneficiaries. MA plan directors confirm in interviews
that PAC is a major focus of efforts to reduce care utilization and costs through four mechanisms: limiting use
of PAC overall; steering beneficiaries to less expensive forms (HH) instead of more expensive forms (SNF);
restricting choice of providers; and limiting PAC length of stay. Early reports suggest MA plans may strongly
influence PAC utilization. Whether reductions in PAC utilization in MA improve PAC value is unknown. The
limited existing literature has two main gaps: first, it does not adequately account for the substantial underlying
differences in the MA and FFS populations. Second, it has focused on short-term outcomes, while PAC likely
has a substantial impact on longer-term functional status and independence. Our overall goal is to inform
patients, providers, and policymakers about ways to improve the value of PAC for all Medicare beneficiaries.
To achieve this goal, we propose innovative analytic strategies that address limitations in the prior literature
and allow accurate assessment of the use and outcomes of PAC in similar MA and FFS beneficiaries. Our
aims are to: 1) Compare use of SNF and HH in similar MA and FFS beneficiaries after hospital discharge, and
the impact of different mechanisms for limiting PAC utilization; 2) Compare PAC outcomes (community days,
long-term institutionalization, rehospitalization, mortality) at 100 days and 1 year after hospital discharge in MA
and FFS; and 3) Evaluate the effects of MA versus FFS enrollment on specific subpopulations of patients
known to be at high risk for poor PAC outcomes. These results will provide novel insights into the effect of MA
plans on PAC use and outcomes, identifying potential benefits or unintended consequences that can shape
policy."
10886105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to improve activities of therapeutic antibodies against cancer
metastasis through developing novel bispecific antibodies (BsAbs). The central hypothesis of this project is that
BsAbs designed with one specificity for a receptor or marker overexpressed on the cancer cell surface and the
other specificity for a soluble growth factor or cytokine abundant in the tumor microenvironment induce co-
phagocytosis of the growth factor or cytokine in the tumor microenvironment along with the co-targeted cancer
cells via antibody-mediated cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and thereby produce stronger antitumor activities
than simple combination of 2 parental antibodies. The applicant has developed a pair of BsAbs, one mouse
and one human, using a new BsAb format targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), an
oncogenic driver that is emerging as a promising target for genomically informed therapy across a variety of
cancer types beyond breast and gastric cancer, and targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA),
another key driver that promotes tumor angiogenesis and suppresses tumor immune responses in the tumor
microenvironment. Preliminary studies with the BsAbs showed remarkable anti-metastasis activity and
prolonged survival in mouse tumor models. In the work proposed, three specific aims will be rigorously
pursued: Aim 1 is to test the working hypothesis that the BsAbs exert stronger antitumor activities than simple
combination of the 2 parental antibodies through inducing VEGFA co-phagocytosis via ADCP. Aim 2 is to
determine the extent to which adaptive immune response is involved in the mechanisms of action of the BsAbs
against metastasis of syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 is to assess the translational potential of the
BsAbs against colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in humanized mice. The proposed work will
be carried out through 1) investigating the role of engagement of FcγR in BsAb-mediated VEGFA co-
phagocytosis and in BsAb-mediated antitumor activity, 2) analyzing the immune landscape in the tumor
microenvironment and detecting presence of antigen-specific T cells upon treatment with BsAb vs with simple
combination of 2 parental antibodies with and without FcγR blockade, and 3) determining the therapeutic
activity of the BsAbs against HER2-overexpressing colorectal cancer PDXs in humanized mice. The work is
expected to demonstrate that VEGFA co-phagocytosis by the BsAbs is a key mechanism by which the BsAbs
exert stronger antitumor activity than simple combination of the 2 parental antibodies in the mouse models, and
that T cell-mediated activities play an additional important role in synergizing the BsAb's antitumor activity. The
impact of this work is expected to be high because if the study is successful, the findings will support future
clinical testing of BsAbs to treat metastasis and recurrence of HER2-overexpressing colorectal cancer and
development of additional BsAbs to target other growth factor receptors or markers overexpressed on the
cancer cell surface and other tumor-promoting growth factors and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment."
10792639,"Project Summary: Characterizing the Function of the Periplasmic Protease Tsp in Chlamydial
Secondary Differentiation
 Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a range of serious diseases in
humans. In developed countries, Chlamydia trachomatis is the primary cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections (STI). Indeed, recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control highlight the increasing incidence
of STIs, with chlamydia infections consistently outpacing all other types. In developing countries, C.
trachomatis is not only a significant cause of STI, but it is also responsible for the primary cause of infectious
preventable blindness, trachoma. The major concern of chlamydial infections is that they are often
asymptomatic and undiagnosed, which can lead to chronic sequelae. These include pelvic inflammatory
disease, tubal factor infertility, and reactive arthritis for C. trachomatis. Consequently, chlamydial diseases
remain a significant burden on health care systems around the world.
 In adapting to obligate intracellular growth, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and
eliminated genes from various pathways as it relies on the host cell for its metabolic needs. This pathogen
has also adapted to alternate between different functional and morphological forms during its normal growth,
also referred to as its developmental cycle. These observations, combined with its obligate intracellular
dependence, makes Chlamydia a difficult organism with which to work. However, recent development of
genetic tools to study chlamydiae mechanistically have significantly enhanced our understanding of this
pathogen. This proposal applies a combination of these new genetic techniques and classical biochemical
studies to evaluate the role of a conserved periplasmic protease system in chlamydial growth and
pathogenesis. The hypothesis of the proposed work is that Chlamydia uses this periplasmic protease to effect
secondary differentiation from the replicative to the infectious form of the organism by degrading cell division-
related proteins. This prevents further division of the replicative form as the bacteria differentiate. Major goals
of this proposal are (i) to characterize the function of the periplasmic protease Tsp both in vitro and in vivo
and (ii) to identify and validate substrates of Tsp. Results will advance our understanding of this important
pathogen and lead to the design of novel therapeutic agents that are specific for Chlamydia. This in turn will
allow for minimal effects on normal flora for patients receiving treatment for this highly prevalent disease."
10867342,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malaria is a leading cause of human death and illness, causing over 200 million cases of clinical
malaria and 400,000 deaths each year. Traditional measures to control and cure malaria are
threatened by emergence of artemisinin resistance (ART-R). Research into ART-R has focused
mostly on mechanisms allowing parasite to tolerate the oxidative stress and protein damage
resulting from ART’s mechanism of action. However, recent discoveries indicate that resistance-
associated mutations in the K13 slows cytostome function to diminish the available hemoglobin in
the food vacuole. Our preliminary results revealed that the parasite’s sensitivity and tolerance to
ART significantly overlaps with innate stress response pathways that enable P. falciparum survival
of malaria fever. Our experimental approach is to elucidate drug-gene associations and decipher
mechanisms of action and resistance to ART and other antimalarial drugs, using forward genetic
screens of P. falciparum mutants created by random piggyBac mutagenesis. This approach has
determined that genetic mutations in the major parasite processes critical for P. falciparum malarial
fever survival response significantly correlate with altered sensitivity to ART (DHA, AS), indicating
the parasite hijacked the heat-shock stress response pathways to cope with ART toxicity. We will
use small libraries of piggyBac clones and GO-focused libraries for iterative screens of different
phenotypes to functionally annotate interacting partners, pathways, and regulatory processes
linked to ART mechanism of action and resistance. We will use genome-level screens to identify
factors linked to ART mechanism of action. We will extend our analysis to P. knowlesi to
characterize the conserved high-value antimalarial drug targets by adapting and applying
chemogenomic profiling analysis to this vivax-like malaria parasite."
10865045,"The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase is the world’s largest source of information on the
functions of genes, and is a foundation for computational analysis in biomedical research. Reac-
tome integrates information about the interconnected biological pathways that describe human
biology at a molecular level. The proposed work will extend a collaboration between the GO and
Reactome projects to better integrate content currently siloed in the two resources and several
related reference resources to provide a more fully interoperable open access resource for the
biomedical research community.
GO provides widely-used tools for associating an individual gene product with a cellular compo-
nent of which it is a part, a molecular function it mediates, and a biological process in which it
participates. Annotations of biological reactions in the Reactome Knowledgebase integrate
many such atomic GO assertions concerning gene products as they interact in biological pro-
cesses, information of great potential value to researchers who use GO annotations, but hard to
use because the two are formulated differently. The recently developed GO Causal Activity
Model (GO-CAM) formalism, which extends atomic GO annotation to capture and integrate en-
tire biological processes, can form the basis of integration between GO and Reactome's path-
way models, increasing their utility.
We propose to develop an integrated pathway/ontology resource by developing tools to effi-
ciently extract GO-CAM model content and further integrate GO-CAM / Reactome models with
key reference resources such as Rhea (a database of expert-curated biochemical reactions)
and the Protein Ontology (PRO), an ontological representation of protein-related entities.
Specifically, we will 1) generate GO-CAM models for every Reactome pathway that represents
a normal human biological process; 2) coordinate curation and QA between Reactome and GO;
3) support data exchange among resources and cross-validate the mappings; and 4) extend this
work to support efficient, partly automated creation of pathway resources for model organisms.
The end result will be an open-source, integrated set of tools and data that accurately represent
human and model organism biological processes, supporting diverse data mining, analysis, and
modeling activities. These tools and data will be incorporated into GO, Reactome, PRO, and
participating model organism resources, supporting long-term alignment of key community re-
sources after the completion of this project."
10900715,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune profiling studies continue to increase in complexity, with multi-omic designs that encompass additional
dimensions such as time, tissue, and spatial profiling becoming more commonplace. Unsupervised
dimensionality reduction has been a widely used and valuable approach for extracting and understanding the
major sources of variation in previous studies, but popular methods such as Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) cannot support these increases in data complexity, nor can
existing multi-omic embedding methods, which are designed for static datasets. It is critical that algorithms be
developed that incorporate the complex data structures inherent in state-of-the-art immune profiling multi-omics
studies that include additional dimensions (e.g., time or space) in order to capture multi-resolution components
of vaccination and infection.
The goal of this project is to develop algorithms based on tensor frameworks - which are extensions of matrices
beyond two dimensions. Tensors naturally represent complex data without flattening on any variable, and tensor
decompositions can identify multi-index patterns of variation, analogous to PCA or NMF in higher dimensions.
Tensor decomposition methodology is an active area of research in the applied mathematics community, but is
under-developed for application to immune profiling data, and current methods face critical challenges that
prevent them from being directly applied in immunology studies. This project brings together computational
immunology and applied mathematics researchers to strengthen and develop novel approaches of tensor
decomposition in order to make them beneficial to the immunology community. Aim 1 will reframe a tensor
decomposition problem into a regularized NMF problem, thereby allowing tools developed for matrix analysis to
be used on tensor data, and furthermore will extend the new algorithm to handle multi-omics data that has a
temporal or spatial component. Aim 2 will directly improve tensor decomposition approaches by developing
novel metrics for tensor decomposition quality, and by extending a multi-omic embedding method into the tensor
space using a novel tensor-algebra. The resulting algorithm will be able to generate components associated
with data that can include both multi-omic and multi-dimensional (e.g. time, space, tissue, etc.) designs. These
components can be analyzed for association with clinical features and outcomes, allowing for discovery of novel
biological mechanisms. The proposed project will result in a suite of complementary algorithms that will aid the
immunology community in understanding complex pathogenic and treatment/vaccination processes using the
increasingly complex study designs that are becoming common to immune profiling studies."
10892939,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and a leading
cause of disability in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). My long-term career goal is to address the
burden posed by these disorders by becoming a leading expert in the implementation and dissemination of
evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for these disorders for use in LMICs. This goal is motivated by observations
from the literature and my own work. Despite the development of EBTs, an overwhelming majority of those in
need (i.e., 85%) in LMICs do not receive treatment and, when they do, it is not empirically based. Despite the
clear need for EBTs in LMICs, there are three primary barriers associated with the implementation of EBTs in
these areas. These barriers include: (1) EBTs tend to be single disorder focused only treating one disorder at a
time, (2) they are long in duration (e.g., 12-16 treatment sessions to treat one disorder), and (3) they tend to be
complex and require a high level of skill to administer. Given the low availability of highly trained providers in
LMICs, using an approach that is brief, culturally congruent, and less complex than typical EBTs is ideal for
reducing these barriers. Proposed Study. The current study aims to evaluate a brief transdiagnostic treatment
for anxiety disorders and PTSD (False Safety Behavior Elimination Treatment; F-SET; Schmidt et al., 2012) for
use in South African primary care clinics. The aims follow a well-established implementation and dissemination
model (PRISM; Feldstein & Glasgow, 2008) for all study aims. First, we will conduct in-depth qualitative
interviews with patients (n=24) and providers and staff (n=10) to assess key barriers and facilitators to the
implementation and sustainability of the F-SET intervention in South African primary care clinics (Specific Aim
1). Second, the F-SET intervention and implementation strategy will be adapted based on the findings from the
qualitative study (Specific Aim 2). Third, we will conduct a randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
to assess the effectiveness of the adapted F-SET and explore facilitators and barriers to implementation
(Specific Aim 3). We will use a mixed methods approach (qualitative and quantitative) to evaluate the F-SET
intervention administered by primary care nurses compared to an enhanced standard care control group in a
sample of individuals with anxiety disorders and PTSD (N=60). We will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability
of implementation as measured by: (1) patient participation and retention and (2) provider’s perceptions of
barriers and facilitators of F-SET. Provider fidelity and quality of treatment delivery will be used as moderators.
These data will be used to submit an R01 for a fully powered trial with clinic randomization in Year 4. Training
Aims: This K01 proposal is will provide me with training needed to achieve my long-term career goal through
training in: (1) the conducting culturally informed clinical trials in global mental health, (2) mixed methods
research for implementation trials, and (3) implementation and dissemination science. The K01 training includes
expert mentorship, extensive field-based experience in South Africa, coursework at Harvard, and publications."
10846623,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce viremia to undetectable levels in people living with HIV (PLWH) .
However, replication-competent virus persists in peripheral blood and tissues that is capable of
reestablishing the infection upon antiretroviral therapy interruption (ATI). One of our long-term goals is to
aid the development of effective HIV cure strategies by gaining a better understanding of the host
physiological and metabolic processes by which cellular reservoirs are established and maintained, and
those of viral reactivation. Regardless of how HIV infection is acquired, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a
major site of HIV replication. Although the majority of immune cells in the body, including CD4+ T cells,
reside in the GI tract, little is known about the HIV reservoir that is established in this tissue. Analyses of
ART-treated patients have demonstrated higher HIV-DNA levels in GI tract cells compared to blood cells,
suggestive of a larger HIV reservoir. Examination of HIV transcripts in cells from the blood and rectum of
ART-treated PLWH also indicates that the GI tract may be enriched in latently-infected cells and suggests
that HIV latency is maintained by different mechanisms in the GI tract and/or that a deeper s tate of latency
may be maintained. Based on these observations, our overarching hypothesis is that HIV establishes a
latent infection in the GI tract that contributes to virus rebound during ATI. T o our knowledge there is
virtually no information addressing the role of the microbiome in establishing or maintaining the latent
reservoir in the GI tract. Currently, a large amount of indirect evidence suggests that the GI microbiome is
involved in HIV persistence. The GI microbiome in PLWH promotes inflammation and immune activation in
the GI tract, which may influence HIV reservoir size. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that microbiota and
microbial metabolites can influence HIV transcription. Therefore, we further hypothesize that the intestinal
microbiome contributes to the establishment and persistence of the HIV reservoir and thereby impacts the
contribution of the GI tract to virus rebound. A role for the microbiome in HIV remission would be
fundamentally important to HIV cure development. Previously, we and others demonstrated that HIV
establishes a latent infection in ART-suppressed humanized mice that upon discontinuation of ART results
in robust virus rebound. Importantly, we recently demonstrated reproducible induction of HIV in resting
CD4+ T cells in multiple tissues of ART-suppressed humanized mice using two different latency reversal
approaches. Our objective is to analyze the HIV reservoir in the GI tract using BLT humanized mice, a well-
characterized model of HIV latency, persistence and reactivation. We will 1) analyze HIV reservoir formation
in the GI tract, 2) evaluate the contribution of the GI tract to viral rebound, and 3) assess HIV induction in
the Gl tract by latency reversing agents. We will also use an innovative germ-free BLT mouse model to
determine how the presence of the GI microbiome contributes to HIV persistence and rebound."
10896180,"Project Summary / Abstract
 We look between targets located in the 3D visual environment by making disjunctive saccades that bring
the target image onto both foveae. Each gaze shift is followed by a fixation period for visual analysis during which
the new vergence level must be maintained. Most studies have focused on the circuitry controlling conjugate
saccades, whereas the neural control of disjunctive saccades and vergence eye movements has received less
study. Several models suggest that abducens motoneurons send a monocular command carrying information to
each eye to control disjunctive saccades. Other models have proposed the existence of saccade-vergence burst
neurons (SVBNs) that project to medial rectus motoneurons and are active only during disjunctive saccades. We
have identified this novel cell type, which only discharge during disjunctive saccades, in the central
mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF) lateral to the oculomotor nucleus (OMN). Electrical microstimulation
in this region of the cMRF elicits disjunctive saccades, whereas inactivation impairs vergence gaze holding.
Recent anatomical findings have demonstrated that premotor neurons related to the near response are located
in the cMRF, and that they project to the supraoculomotor area (SOA) and to the OMN. We hypothesize that the
cMRF, and the SVBNs in particular, play a critical role in the generation of disjunctive saccades. We further
hypothesize that projections between the cMRF and SOA form part of a previously undescribed neural circuit
that produces vergence integration, allowing vergence angle to be maintained during fixation. Other anatomical
and electrophysiological findings demonstrate that the cerebellum, specifically, the caudal fastigial nucleus and
the posterior interposed nucleus, play a role in controlling vergence eye movements in both normal and
strabismic individuals. We therefore hypothesize that the cerebellar input to the cMRF/SOA complex helps
encode or modulate disjunctive saccades. Guided by these overarching hypotheses, we propose Specific Aims
to characterize this neural circuitry. 1. To determine the role of SVBNs and the cMRF in the production of
disjunctive saccades; 2. To test the hypothesis that the cMRF/SOA complex is the vergence integrator
responsible for maintaining the level of convergence; 3. To determine how the cerebellar projections to
the cMRF/SOA circuitry are involved in the generation of disjunctive saccades and vergence eye
movements. To test our specific hypotheses, we will use established neurophysiological techniques
(electrophysiological recordings, antidromic activation, electrical microstimulation and reversible
pharmacological modulation). The overall goal of our project is to substantially increase our understanding of the
neural circuitry controlling 3D eye movements in primates, and to broadly impact the oculomotor field, leading to
new neurophysiological and modeling approaches. These findings will also provide a critical basis for
understanding the absence of precise binocular coordination in eye movement dysfunctions such as strabismus."

translation. In this application we request support for 4 KL2 scholars and have an institutional commitment
for an additional 4 scholars. All grant-funded and institutionally funded scholars will be selected through a
University-wide RFA, have access to the same career development opportunities, and same expectations for
progress toward development of scientific independence. The selected scholars will be enrolled in an intensive
3-year program designed to prepare the next generation of leaders in CTS. Our Aims are to:
1. Recruit and engage talented scholars from diverse backgrounds in collaborative clinical and
translational sciences (CTS) career development.
2. Implement an intensive mentoring/coaching strategy for current and recent scholars to ""turn the

3. Leverage the strengths of our CTSl's rural environment, partnerships and technologies to develop a
CTS research practicum in rural health.
4. Refine processes for collection, analysis and utilization of evaluative data guided by the logic model
to foster continuous quality improvement of the career development program.
We recognize multiple factors contribute to the scholars' transition to independence, including their initiative,
persistence, resilience, supportive mentorship, interactions with collaborators, protected research time, and the
institutional research infrastructure and culture. Timing for milestones on the path toward independence also
varies depending on each individual's prior training. Our programmatic offerings are coordinated with the
Translational Endeavors Core, the Community Engaged Research Core (CERC) and the TL 1 program, and
include advanced degrees, core seminars, experiential opportunities, individual courses, learning modules, and
flexibility for individualized learning. Intended outcomes are competent translational researchers with skills to
accelerate discovery by bridging gaps and innovation along the translational research continuum."
10892792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Primordial germ cells seed the somatic gonad early in vertebrate development, and develop together to yield a
functional testis replete with spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). This population of SSCs maintains itself while
generating astonishing numbers of differentiated sperm across the lifetime of the animal. We lack an
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in SSCs that maintain an active population of stem
cells. Studies of SSCs in vertebrates have been limited to population or single-cell snapshot studies, which fail
to capture the contributions of individual SSCs to this process.
Here, I propose to apply recently developed CRISPR lineage tracing, CRISPR mutagenesis, and single-cell
RNA sequencing methods to uncover the mechanisms that maintain the vertebrate testis. First, we will
investigate the dynamics of individual germline stem cells in testis homeostasis. We will use CRISPR lineage
tracing in zebrafish to determine the contributions of individual SSCs to self-renewal and differentiation, and
serial sampling from individual animals to track long-term dynamics. Second, we will characterize new
regulators of SSC homeostasis. Using single-cell atlases of SSC gene expression, we will use our rapid
CRISPR methods to mutagenize candidate regulator genes and phenotype using single-cell phenotyping and
high-resolution imaging. Third, we will examine the evolutionary mechanisms that have generated testis
phenotypic diversity across the vertebrate subphylum. We will generate single-cell, spatially resolved atlases of
the juvenile, adult and aged testis from species across a phylogenetic tree of teleosts, and use comparative
gene expression analysis to determine cellular and molecular differences in SSCs and niche cells.
These projects will define the molecular and cellular mechanisms that maintain stem cell populations within the
testis, with implications for human infertility. They will also uncover general principles of stem cell homeostasis
in tissues and organs."
10918188,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a non-invasive imaging technique with exquisite soft-tissue detail for the
assessment of heart structure and function and provides an excellent screening tool but cannot always obviate
more invasive procedures, such as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Interventional CMR (iCMR) is a minimally
invasive technique without radiation, which has been hampered by the lack of non-ferrous devices that can be
easily visualized, enabling the navigation of tasks, such as EMB, safely. Currently, one in nine deaths in the
US is attributed to heart failure (HF), with health care costs exceeding $30 billion in 2013. Of the ~5.1 million
Americans with HF, the definitive treatment is heart transplantation (HTx), where rejection is assessed with
endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) – a procedure performed under X-ray guidance to obtain random samples of the
right ventricular septum. However, many patients, especially children with cardiomyopathy and after HTx and
HF caused by non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM), do not have global changes to the myocardium, but
rather, patchy disease, which is often restricted to limited portions of the left ventricle. Thus, EMB may yield a
definitive diagnosis in <20% of the cases. As complications of EMB include ventricular puncture, pericardial
tamponade, stroke, and death, the risk-benefit ratio of EMB limits its use. However, accurate diagnosis of
cardiomyopathies or early recognition of heart rejection can lead to definitive treatment or measures to avoid
heart rejection, respectively, with enormous individual patient impact. Therefore, we propose to develop an
MRI-compatible suite of interventional devices to allow direct targeting of diseased myocardium (based on
CMR) for EMB and treatment of cardiomyopathies, for both right- and left-sided catheterization. To this end,
we will develop an active pigtail catheter with a guidewire for iCMR cardiac catheterization to be used in
combination with an active MR-steerable sheath/bioptome device or transmyocardial injection catheter. These
devices will enable direct targeting of the disease to increase diagnostic yield and decrease complications.
Currently, there are no commercially available active MR-visible EMB, pigtail, or injection catheters. Significant
advances to our realization of a clinically relevant MR-EMB device include the creation of a sharp-jaw EMB
mechanism that is safe from heating, but provides a specific MR signature when the device is open vs. closed,
and injection devices that can determine myocardial apposition so that therapeutics reach the intended target
of the myocardium. Furthermore, as pediatric HTx patients receive up to six EMBs in the first year, the iCMR
suite of devices will significantly reduce ionizing radiation in a particularly vulnerable population. Our research
proposal will develop these devices in a canine model of spontaneous NICM that is similar in size to children's
hearts to ensure these are compatible with pediatric interventions. Our extensive expertise in MRI
interventional devices and CMR will be used to achieve this objective. Thus, our goal will be to develop these
MR-guided devices to expand the reach of iCMR to children and adults."
10885149,"Project Summary
With every heartbeat, the junctional complexes that couple cardiomyocytes must transmit the mechanical
forces of contraction while maintaining adhesive homeostasis. Cardiomyocytes are linked end-to-end by the
intercalated disc (ICD), a specialized junction that coordinates cell signaling, electrical and mechanical
operations. The ICD comprises adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes that connect the actin and
intermediate filament cytoskeletons, respectively, of adjoining cells. ICD function requires multiple adhesion
and cytoskeletal proteins and mutations in these proteins are linked to cardiomyopathies. However, relatively
little is known about how adhesion complexes are regulated to establish and maintain heart tissue integrity.
The core of the adherens junction is the cadherin-catenin complex, which is connected to the actin
cytoskeleton through a-catenin. a-Catenin is a multifunctional, mechanoresponsive actin-binding protein that
localizes to the cardiomyocyte ICD. However, a-catenin functions in cell-cell adhesion in cardiomyocytes are
poorly understood. Our objective in this application is to determine how mechanical and molecular inputs are
transduced through the two a-catenins expressed in the human heart – aE(Epithelial)-catenin and aT(Testes)-
catenin – to regulate cardiomyocyte adhesion. Our rationale is that defining the individual and collective roles
of a-catenin at cardiomyocyte AJs will provide fundamental insight into how cardiomyocyte AJs balance
mechanical and signaling functions. We hypothesize that aE-catenin and aT-catenin form unique cadherin-
catenin complexes in response to cellular cues to function as mechanical checkpoints for ICD assembly and
cardiomyocyte organization. In this proposal, we seek to: 1) define the allosteric mechanisms that regulate a-
catenin ligand binding at the cardiomyocyte AJ; 2) determine how ligand recruitment to a-catenin promotes AJ
assembly and cytoskeletal attachment; and 3) identify how external mechanical cues regulate AJ organization.
Knowledge to be gained through our studies include a detailed, mechanistic understanding of how a-catenin
molecular properties are tuned for adhesion in cardiomyocytes; how unique molecular complexes are built
along the cardiomyocyte AJ to establish and maintain adhesion; and how external mechanical cues feed into
the cardiomyocyte AJ to drive organization. This comprehensive, multiscale analysis will develop new tools
and acquire new knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion in cardiomyocytes.
Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cell adhesion in cardiomyocytes is necessary for determining
how mutations in ICD proteins lead to heart disease and inform the development of new strategies for the
treatment of cardiomyopathies."
10838515,"Summary
This research will examine the synaptic and circuit-level properties of neurons of the mouse cochlear nucleus
in vitro, based on recent work that defined cell types through transcriptomic profiles. Major cell types will be
recorded from using patch clamp techniques monitoring the properties of their axonal projections, synaptic
input from auditory nerve, and intrinsic properties and then correlate these with the cells individual
transcriptomic profile using Patch-seq. This will provide new functional insight into the diversity within major
classes of cells in cochlear nucleus. Next, we will use mouse cre lines to drive expression of optogenetic tools
in order to resolve functional differences in the connectivity and inhibitory synapses of different classes of
interneuron. Last, we will optogenetically activate specific populations of principal cell while recording from
single principal cells in order to examine homotypic synaptic connections among principal cells. These results
will provide unprecedented insight into the capacity of neurons in the cochlear nucleus to perform
computations on incoming sensory signals. Moreover the results will provide a foundation for future studies
examining how these computations are distorted with hearing impairment."
10864832,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Project 2
The airway epithelium, like the renal tubular epithelium, expresses proteins that regulate luminal pH. For
example, glutaminase regulates ammonia production; it is inhibited by Th1 cytokines, acidifying the airway.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatory protein regulates outward HCO3- transit, and its absence results in
luminal acidification. Decreased airway lining fluid pH can promote airway inflammation as well as viral and
bacterial replication. We hypothesize that the distal airway epithelial surface is acidic, both because of high CO2
levels and low- pH lamellar bodies; that pH increases as airway lining fluid is swept proximally; and that impaired
airway luminal buffering can contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma. In particular, there is evidence that
acute asthma exacerbations are associated with a fall in airway luminal pH; an effect reversed by glucocorticoids.
Further, some asthma patients have a low luminal pH at baseline. Here, we will study the cellular determinants
of airway pH regulation. We will make use of the effect of airway pH to alter airway NO metabolism and
bioactivities (Project 1) to map the location and effects of low pH in the asthmatic airway in vivo. We will study
the recently discovered effects of androgens (Project 3) to promote the expression of beneficial pH regulatory
enzymes in asthma. Finally, we will study the potential benefit of inhaled buffer in asthma patients with
exacerbations. Specifically, we will carry out three aims.
In Aim 1, we will characterize the cellular determinants of airway pH. In Aim 2, we will map the epithelial pH of
the normal and asthmatic airway. In Aim 3, we will measure the effect of inhaled buffer on inflammation and
response to β2 agonists in asthma. At the end of the project, we anticipate having mapped both the cellular
regulation of airway epithelial pH and the anatomic variations in airway pH in health and in asthma; and we will
have developed a new, personalized approach to target pH abnormalities in patients with asthma exacerbations."
10864833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asthma is a sexually dimorphic disease, with women exhibiting higher asthma prevalence and more severe
manifestations than men. Projects 3 builds upon the rationale that androgens such as testosterone and
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) have been linked to better outcomes in asthma. However, mechanisms of
androgen-mediated regulation of airway biology are only incompletely understood. In addition, it is unclear if
androgen therapy is beneficial in severe asthma and if specific patient populations exist that could be targeted
via a precision medicine approach. Project 3 aims to fill this knowledge gap and identify novel, therapeutically
targetable mechanisms of androgen-mediated improvement in lung function. Ultimately, this will lead to novel,
targeted and corticosteroid-sparing therapies for patients with severe asthma of either sex. We have generated
intriguing new data suggesting a causal relationship between androgens and relief of human asthmatic airflow
obstruction. In particular, we found that in women with mild asthma and low DHEA-sulfate plasma levels, DHEA
treatment was associated with a significant improvement in FEV1. Second, we discovered in a cohort of severe
asthma patients that a variant in position 1245 of the gene HSD3B1 (encoding an enzyme that increases tissue
androgen levels) is associated with a lower FEV1 if DHEA-S plasma levels are low. Third, we found that increased
androgen receptor mRNA abundance in airway epithelial cells (AECs) is associated with improved lung function
and fewer asthma symptoms. These data led us to hypothesize that androgens exert beneficial effects on S-
nitrosylation, pH regulation and inflammatory signaling that lead to improved lung function in patients with severe
asthma, and that genetic variations in androgen signaling are clinically relevant modifiers of the therapeutic
response in these patients. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether androgens
favorably impact S-nitrosylation and pH regulation in brushed AECs from patients with severe asthma; 2) To
study if androgens regulate pro-inflammatory mediator gene and protein expression in AECs from patients with
severe asthma; and 3) To investigate if DHEA improves FEV1 and decreases FeNO in asthma patients with low
DHEA-S levels and a favorable HSD3B1 genotype. The proposed studies are significant, since they will provide
a better understanding of the yet unknown mechanisms and targets of androgen signaling in severe asthma.
Conceptual innovation is provided at several levels: First, we will identify novel mechanisms of androgen
signaling in AECs in severe asthma and establish a critical crosstalk with nitrosylation/de-nitrosylation, pH
regulation and inflammation. Second, we will identify sex and androgens as modifiers of AEC-ASMC crosstalk.
Third, we will perform the first mechanistic studies of the role of HSD3B1 in severe asthma. Upon conclusion of
our studies, we will have identified novel and therapeutically targetable mechanisms of androgen signaling in
AECs and ASMCs in severe asthma, and we will have identified a novel population of male and female patients
that will benefit from a personalized and targeted hormone-based treatment approach."

The Infectious Disease Assay Development (IDAD) laboratory for studying the Chemical Biology of Infectious
Disease provides expertise on assay development and screening of small molecule libraries. The compounds
identified from the screen serve as chemical tools or probes for dissecting mechanism of action and

perform chemical screening, it is critical to design, develop and optimize assays that truly reflect specific
target function in infectious disease biology. The University of Kansas has an established and successful HTS
facility with excellent intellectual and physical resources. The Infectious Disease Assay Development core
established in Phase I of CBID funding takes advantage of these assets and expands the current capabilities
by providing additional expertise and dedicated research space to develop assays against novel disease
relevant targets. The overall goal of this core is to provide a full array of expertise, facilities, services, and
training in the area of HTS assay design, development, validation, small and large-scale screening for

miniaturized and validated assays suitable for automated large-scale screening that can be performed
internally or externally. The expertise and resources are also expected to enable investigators to develop
competitive proposals in response to funding opportunity announcements for discovery of chemical probes or
therapeutic agents from Department of Defense, or NIH. Additionally, hits generated through successful

The last decade ushered in amazing advances in neuroimaging due to transformative developments in
magnetic resonance and optical imaging techniques as well as in computational and modeling tools. A common
thread in these advances is their multi-disciplinary nature, requiring collaborations among medical
researchers, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and data scientists, among many others. In order to
continue the pace of technical advances in neuroimaging and to exploit their unique capabilities for brain

setting 1) with an abundance of state-of-the-art tools, 2) with a programmatic interest in developing novel
neuroimaging technologies and biomedical applications, and 3) where trainees can carry out groundbreaking
research under multi-disciplinary mentorship. The University of Minnesota (UMN) has an excellent tradition
of training neuroimaging postdocs in its Medical School and its College of Science & Engineering. It is also the
home of major, world-renowned efforts in neuroimaging technology development and novel biomedical
applications of neuroimaging. The proposed Minnesota Neuroimaging Postdoctoral Training Grant aims to
give 14 postdoctoral fellows – at least 4 of whom will be from communities under-represented in STEM fields –
multi-disciplinary skills in neuroimaging technology development and advanced biomedical applications,
guidance in career development, and social and networking support through intense two-year neuroimaging
fellowships at UMN. Each fellow's primary research will be conducted on a multi-disciplinary project that
combines their background with another field with the express goal of developing new neuroimaging
technologies. Each fellow will be co-mentored by two faculty selected from the 40+ participating faculty in this
grant: one that will directly supervise the research project, and one that represents a core area related to the

10907844,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The National Academy of Sciences describes the barriers that scientists experience on the path from mentored
to independent research as the single most critical threat to the future of biomedical sciences in the United
States (US). Women and individuals from marginalized groups face steeper obstacles, particularly in
technology-intensive fields such as omic sciences. Despite NIH’s separate grant reviews and paylines, the
mean age at which investigators receive their first R01 has continued to climb to an all-time high of 46 years,
extending a 35-year negative trend. In parallel, the likelihood of PhD graduates becoming professors has
dropped significantly in the last decades, putting the future of biomedical research in the US at risk.
To address these challenges, we propose the 'Career MODE' program: Careers through Mentoring and
training in Omics and Data for Early-stage investigators to empower diverse cohorts of young researchers
across the US—i.e., postdocs in the final years of mentored training and faculty members within two years of
their first appointment—to establish independent, successful careers in omics and data sciences. Omics—
ranging from genomics to the microbiome—have revolutionized biomedical sciences. As they have become
part of any biomedical field, the scarcity of a workforce within each discipline with appropriate omic training has
emerged as a critical challenge. We seek to develop an 11-month program to provide intensive training in
omics and data science and specialized mentoring from a nationwide, diverse network of 70+ mentors. Career
MODE will also feature training in professional skills, including leadership and team management, grant
writing, mentoring, goal setting and strategy development, communication and teaching, scientific rigor,
transparency, reproducibility, responsible conduct of research, and health equity. By leveraging its nationwide
group of mentors and trainees, Career MODE will also offer a structured approach to enhance collaborations
and networking, help create teams for breakthrough research projects and K99/R00 and R01-type grant
proposals, further career development, and help secure tenure-track positions and faculty promotions.
Career MODE will feature hybrid (virtual and in-person) coursework and learning activities (boot camps,
roundtables, panels, symposia, observerships), a robust evaluation of each objective, and will generate and
disseminate extensive educational material on omics and data science. The program will do outreach to the
most promising, motivated, and diverse junior investigators—a group traditionally with limited resources— to
create empowered cohorts of scientists to pursue independence through advanced knowledge and tools in
omics and data sciences applicable to all biomedical research fields. Thus, our program aligns with NIGMS
goals and provides a high return for investment. We will also develop strategies to advance equity and access
in omics research and promote Career MODE to academic institutions, sponsors, and stakeholders to reach
financial sustainability and self-support beyond the five years of R25 funding."

I have been dissecting the mechanisms of immune regulation for ~27 years, and have been discovering and
dissecting immune inhibitory mechanisms in cancer for over 10 years. Cancer immunology and immunotherapy
now occupy ~80% of my research and translational focus. This has not only led to numerous cancer-focused
high impact papers (11; Nature [1], Cell [1], Nature Immunology [4], Immunity [3], Science Immunology [1];
Cancer Research [1]), with 5 since 2016, but has also facilitated the development of immunotherapeutics
targeting LAG3, EBI3 and NRP1 in multiple cancer clinical trials, some in Phase III.
Inhibitory mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) represent major barriers to effective anti-tumor
immunity. Although striking efficacy has been reported with inhibitory receptor (IR) blockade, it’s clear that
additional inhibitory mechanisms will need to be targeted to substantially improve therapeutic outcome in most
tumor types and for most patients. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent inhibitors of anti-tumor immunity. Although
Treg ablation results in rapid tumor shrinkage in multiple cancer models, this is not a viable therapeutic approach
due to the subsequent severe autoimmune consequences. Thus, novel approaches are needed to limit Treg
activity selectively in tumors, combined with a detailed understanding of their mechanism of action.
We have previously focused on two main lines of inquiry, with emphasis on mechanisms that are selectively
upregulated and impactful within the TME: [a] How do Tregs work in the TME? This led to the discovery of the
inhibitory cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35). [b] What potentiates Treg stability, survival and function? This led to the
discovery of the NRP1:SEMA4A axis that controls Treg stability and function, and protects them from the negative
impact of IFNg. Despite these seminal advances and their translation into the clinic, there is a substantive sense
that many aspects of Treg function, stability, control and fate in the TME remain unknown.
In the next seven years, my program will focus on two major questions: (1) Are there other cytokines or
suppressive mechanisms used by Tregs in the TME? Discovery, mechanistic dissection and translation of
novel Treg-derived cytokines within the TME, with emphasis on novel EBI3-containing heterodimers. (2) Are
there other mechanisms that impact Treg stability, function & survival in the TME? Identification and
dissection of novel mechanisms that control Treg stability and function in the TME, and/or impact their capacity
to modulate cell types in the TME.
This program will have a significant impact on our understanding of how Tregs manipulate and control the TME,
will provide novel targets and modalities for therapeutic intervention in cancer, and will hopefully inspire others
to develop novel approaches to target Tregs in cancer and other diseases."

Black women have the highest rates of obesity in the United States and are at heightened risk for type 2
diabetes mellitus. While achieving clinically significant weight loss of 8-10% may reduce risk, Black women
have disparate behavioral weight loss treatment outcomes. Untreated binge eating may be a contributing
factor. Indeed, nearly 30% of Black women with obesity report binge eating behaviors; those who binge eat are
likely to regain weight at a faster rate, drop out of behavioral weight loss interventions (SBWL), and have
poorer health outcomes. Black women, however, are far less likely to engage in mental health treatment for
binge eating. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-
based settingsplaces where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-
related concerns. Given the barriers Black women face in accessing in-person treatment for binge eating,
digital treatment platforms may provide the opportunity to construct a culturally-relevant and accessible
treatment option. Current intervention research to treat binge eating among Black women is scarce. To fill this
gap, I desire to become a leading health disparities independent investigator with a research program focused
on the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to prevent and treat binge eating and
obesity, but require additional training. The NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award will provide protected time to seek this training and further my skills and ability to implement the
proposed research. My short-term training goals are to develop advanced expertise in: (1) the design and
implementation of clinical trials for obesity; (2) using digital health tools in clinical trials for binge eating and
obesity; (3) implementation science theory and methods; and (4) development and submission of independent,
investigator-initiated research grants. I have developed a strong training plan and mentoring team, led by
Carmen Samuel-Hodge, PhD (co-primary mentor), Cynthia M. Bulik, PhD (co-primary mentor), Dori Steinberg,
PhD (co-mentor), and a team of expert consultants. RESEARCH STRATEGY: The objective of this study is to
modify a validated intervention to develop a digital health tool to treat binge eating and prevent weight gain in
Black women, and examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this tool in a pragmatic clinical trial. I will
engage Black women who binge eat (BMI > 30 kg/m2) to identify barriers and facilitators to detecting and
treating binge eating, adapt a validated eating behavior and nutrition intervention guided by stakeholder input,
and use Semblie, a UNC-hosted, no-cost online platform that provides tools to build, deliver, and track digital
health interventions to construct the tool. This training and research plan will form the basis for a future
multicenter clinical trial testing the efficacy of the digital health tool for improving binge eating and weight
outcomes among adults who binge eat, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K23
award."
10901847,"Experiments proposed here offer key training and significant elements in a path toward Dr. Paola Rosas’
career goals with focus on the understanding of the relations among gender, obesity and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF>50%). HFpEF is more frequently seen in postmenopausal women
(2:1) vs men and in obese patients. Moreover, obesity and extreme obesity are higher in women than men.
However, the cause of these differences are unclear. Proposed studies build on preliminary evidence of
localization of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) in adipose tissue and its involvement in female fat accumulation
that accentuates with aging. Aged female global PAK1 knock-out (PAK1-/-) mice exhibit significantly increased
visceral adiposity, similar to post-menopausal women. Furthermore, with aging, unlike male PAK1-/- mice,
female PAK1-/- mice show diastolic dysfunction. PAK1 is a pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinase
demonstrated to be cardio-protective against different stressors. There is evidence, in other organs, that PAK1
is involved in estrogen signaling pathways; however, these processes have not yet been studied in the heart or
in the adipose tissue. These discoveries led to the hypothesis that PAK1 is regulated by estrogens, and that
dysregulation of PAK1 due to lack of estrogens, contributes to obesity and HFpEF. With these findings in
mind, I propose the following aims. Aim #1: Investigate the mechanisms by which estrogens regulate PAK1 in
the heart and the adipose tissue. I will study how PAK1 is activated by estrogens in the heart and the adipose
tissue and how this activation involves estrogen receptor α (ERα) and/or G protein-coupled estrogen receptor
(GPER). Aim #2: Investigate the mechanisms by which PAK1 regulates cardiac function in female mice. I will
study how the absence of PAK1 in a PAK1-cardiac specific knock-out mouse model, affects intracellular Ca2+
kinetics and the response of myofilaments to Ca2+, thereby affecting cardiac relaxation. Aim #3: Investigate the
mechanisms by which PAK1 regulates adipose tissue homeostasis in female mice and the effect of its
dysregulation on cardiac function. I will examine how lack of PAK1 in adipose tissue promotes increased
visceral adiposity leading to obesity which subsequently affects diastolic function in the female heart.
Impact: Addressing these aims will significantly advance our understanding of the role of PAK1 on the
regulation of cardiac and adipose tissue function in females, by exploring the relation between estrogens and
PAK1 signaling in the heart and the adipose tissue. Furthermore, these contributions will explain, at least in
part, the higher incidence of HFpEF and obesity in post-menopausal women. Results are expected to bring
novel alternatives and open new horizons in the treatment of HFpEF and obesity in women. This research will
also form the basis for Dr. Rosas’ first R01 application to conduct further studies on the role of PAK1 as an
anti-obesity kinase and as a metabolic regulator in women."
10885024,"ABSTRACT
Although outcomes after myocardial infarctions (MIs) have improved, cardiomyocytes (CMs) are lost even with
successful reperfusion. This loss contributes to adverse remodeling, ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart failure,
arrhythmia, and death. Current therapies can only slow or reverse isolated aspects of ischemic heart disease,
and there are no reliable therapies available to replace the cardiac muscle loss to MI. Identifying therapeutic
targets and drugs to protect the myocardium after injury will be groundbreaking, address unmet clinical needs,
and represent new strategies to treat cardiovascular diseases. Our goals are to identify and validate druggable
targets that induce controlled CM cycling and improve heart function after injury. However, two challenges exist:
(1) the identification of candidate pathways to stimulate CM cycling with the intent to improve cardiac function
after injury, and (2) the accurate quantification of CM cycling events in adult myocardium. Therefore, we
conducted investigations to address the two challenges. First, we identified an inhibitor of dual-specificity tyrosine
phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (DYRK1a), Harmine, increased CM cycling, and improved ventricular
function after MI. Next, we generated CM-specific DYRK1a knockout mice and observed CM hyperplasia at
baseline and improved LV function after MI, suggesting DYRK1a contributes to CM function. Second, we
designed and validated a unique transgenic mouse (denoted αDKRC) that drives Cre in adult cycling
CMs. αDKRC complements existing technologies such as Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM);
however, the ability to restrict Cre expression to adult cycling CMs is an advance in the field. We
used αDKRC::DTA mice to express Diphtheria toxin in adult cycling CMs and observed that the loss of
endogenously cycling CMs worsened myocardial function after MI. Since cycling CMs are scarce, the findings
suggest that cycling CMs may contribute to myocardial function beyond the concept of a CM as only a contractile
cell, perhaps by expressing paracrine factors. This potential mechanism suggests that modest increases in
cycling CMs may have a more significant impact on cardiac function after MI because cycling CMs serve
functions beyond the concept of contractility. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that the inhibition of
DYRK1a improves myocardial function after MI, in part, through enhanced CM cycling and the cycling CMs exert
their effects via paracrine factors. We will test our hypothesis in the following Aims: (1) The CM-specific ablation
of DYRK1a during development protects LV function after MI through enhanced cell cycling, (2) The post-
developmental ablation of DYRK1a in adult CMs will improve LV function after MI, and (3) Cycling CMs contribute
to LV function after MI by expressing paracrine factors. The proposed investigations will define the potential of
DYRK1a inhibition as a treatment of MI, identify the mechanisms through which DYRK1a exerts its effects in
CMs, and characterize novel paracrine factors expressed by cycling CMs that potentially serve as new future
therapeutic targets."
10666469,"The overall goal of this renewal proposal is to dissect genetic transcription mechanisms in the human
dopamine transporter gene (hDAT). The dopamine transporter (DAT) regulates the spatio-temporal domains of
dopamine neurotransmission by reuptake and release of dopamine and thus contributes to locomotion,
motivation, cognition and attention, working memory, behavioral organization and hormone release. It is well
recognized that expression of the DAT gene in the brain is highly circumscribed, varies among individual
subjects and can be regulated by endogenous and exogenous factors such as substance uses and stress.
Altered DAT expression may contribute to hDAT-associated pathophysiological states such as substance use
disorders (SUDs). However, information about how hDAT expression is regulated and how DNA sequence
variation influences the regulated expression remains largely sporadic. The hypothesis to be tested in this
proposal is that novel transcription factors (TFs) play a major role in regulating the hDAT promoter via disorder-
associated cis-acting sites. Our preliminary studies show that TFs may regulate the hDAT promoter in an
interactive manner. Therefore, three specific aims of this project are to: 1) demonstrate a RNA-protein complex
involved in the promoter regulation; 2) confirm a TF-mediated antagonism between 5’ and 3’ cis-acting sites;
and 3) identify TFs that bind to two functional VNTRs for promoter regulation. The results will add fundamental
knowledge on lead sites through which hDAT is regulated by signaling pathways and confers risks for related
brain disorders."

Over the last decade fentanyls, methamphetamine and benzodiazepines have proliferated in US illicit drug
markets. These synthetic drugs, increasingly in combinations, are implicated in the ongoing rise in overdose
fatalities. Although drug overdoses commonly involve more than one substance, polydrug use has long been
understudied. Now, the replacement of heroin with novel synthetics such as fentanyls, the resurgence of
methamphetamine, and the proliferation of counterfeit pills, have created a situation of new complexity and
unknown risks with an urgent need for knowledge.
People who use drugs are creating new patterns and modes of polydrug use, for which their motives and
influences are yet to be understood. Some polydrug use may be unintentional due to contamination or
counterfeit products. For example, the contamination or co-use of methamphetamine with fentanyls may
explain the recent rise in stimulant-related mortality. Examination of the use of the once rare but resurgently
popular methamphetamine and heroin cocktail, aka `goofball', now remodeled with fentanyl, may give clues to
the salience and rationale of polysynthetics in drug use repertoires as well as their adverse outcomes.
Aim 1 (Ethnography): To elucidate the effects of synthetic drug supply changes (primarily fentanyls and
methamphetamine) on people who use drugs in combination and to understand their preferences for and
responses and adaptations to these changes.
Aim 2 (Epidemiology): To examine the shift towards polysynthetic drug use through studies of local and
national drug supply and health outcome databases and to determine a) the roles of unintentional co-use from
cross-contamination and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, intentional co-use and drug price/purity/potency in
patterns of synthetic polydrug use and b) the morbidity and mortality outcomes of these use patterns.
Aim 3 (Modeling): To forecast overdose mortality based on evolving risk and protective factors from synthetic
drug combinations. We will use mechanistic (agent-based modeling) and statistical predictive modeling tools,
accounting for the effects of different modes of administration (smoking vs injecting), adaptation (eg tester
shots) and interventions (eg naloxone).
 The Synthetics in Combination (SYNC) study will integrate micro-to-macro-level anthropological, economic,
epidemiological and modeling approaches to gain insight into polydrug use on the ground, to measure and
predict both adverse effects and model methods of mitigating harm. Achieving its objectives will advance
understanding of drug epidemics and morbidities, help tailor public health interventions and provide community
level tools for better monitoring and allocation of scarce resources."
10916248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Successful regenerative medicine approaches require harnessing the appropriate cell signals at the
right time to direct host tissue functions. These signals are often informed by the natural regenerative
processes controlled during development and homeostasis by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and
their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), which allow a cell-based yet cell-free approach for
downstream regenerative technologies. This multidisciplinary, MPI proposal brings together a team of
two senior investigators leading regenerative medicine-focused group with complementary strengths,
co-investigators with critical roles, and industrial partner RoosterBio, Inc. Together, we will create and
test an innovative enabling technology to stably incorporate EVs to a biomaterial intended for tissue
engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Specifically, we will use a novel azide-based click
chemistry technique to controllably immobilize EVs to silk fibroin as a demonstrative application, but
immobilization can also be done on other biomaterials, substrates, or surfaces, or even tissues. We
chose silk as our biomaterial in this application given its FDA-approved status and wide use.
 We hypothesize that “azide-clickable"" MSC-derived EVs (which we will refer to simply as “Az-EVs”)
will have more stable immobilization to silk fibroin biomaterials than unmodified EVs, and this will result
in higher regenerative potency. To test this hypothesis and provide proof-of-concept applications, we
will pursue four specific aims:
Aim 1 - Demonstrate and validate Az-EV immobilization to silk fibroin-based materials;
Aim 2 - Demonstrate the MSC-mimicking effects of Az-EVs immobilized to silk in vitro;
Aim 3 - Demonstrate the regenerative effects of Az-EVs in a mouse chronic wound healing model;
Aim 4 - Demonstrate the regenerative effects of Az-EVs in a rat tissue engineered vascular graft model.
 Partner RoosterBio, Inc. will “industrialize” (scale-up) the production of MSC-derived Az-EVs for
commercialization to make available to other researchers and clinicians.
 This research will provide insight to the efficacy of this novel selective EV immobilization
technology to efficiently direct EV delivery within a biological system of interest. Our proof-of-concept
studies will demonstrate how utilization of this regenerative technology can aid in treating chronic
wounds and enabling TEVGs with improved patency rates."

10798227,"Many types of solid tumors are innervated by distinct branches of the nervous system that, like
the immune system, sense and respond to internal and environmental stimuli. However, nerves
have long been viewed as passive bystanders in cancer. It is poorly understood how the nervous
system regulates the tumor-associated immune responses, and what factors in the tissue-specific
microenvironment shape tumor innervation. Therefore, the overarching goal of our research is to
develop an in-depth and broad understanding of neuro-immune interaction in cancer with a focus
on the bi-directional crosstalk between the sensory neurons and the tumor microenvironment
(TME), and to explore whether we can target such interactions for more effective cancer treatment.
Of particular interest, lung-innervating nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that control
cough and pain, the most common clinical symptoms in lung cancer patients. While nociceptors
were shown to regulate lung immune cells in allergy and bacterial infections, little is known about
their roles in oncogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that nociceptive sensory neurons play a
key role in promoting lung cancer development via cross-talking to the immune cells, particularly
the tumor-associated IL-17+T cells and neutrophils. As such, targeting the nociceptive neural
pathways can improve the cancer response to immunotherapy by reprogramming the tumor
immune microenvironment. Experimentally, we will combine genetically engineered mouse
models that faithfully reproduce the human lung adenocarcinoma with cutting-edge approaches
in cellular immunology, cancer genetics, and functional manipulations of neuronal circuits.
Specifically, we propose to test our central hypothesis by (1) establishing the role of tumor
innervation by sensory neurons in lung cancer, (2) elucidating the mechanisms by which tumor
innervation shapes the cancer-associated immune responses, (3) determining the pre-clinical
efficacy of targeting the nociceptive neural pathway in combination with checkpoint-based
immunotherapy.
Our study will provide fundamental insights to the emerging yet poorly understood functions and
regulatory mechanisms of the sensory nervous system in the TME, especially their role in cancer-
associated immune responses. Furthermore, the conceptual and technological advances
generated here will build the foundation for future investigations into neuro-immune interactions
in additional cancer types, shedding light on sensory neural pathways and neuro-immune
crosstalk that can serve as novel therapeutic targets for cancer prevention and treatment."

We propose investigating the neural mechanisms of placebo (open and hidden) in stroke subjects. This proposal
is built on our recently completed clinical trial NIH R21 (R21HD079048-01A1), which showed that the placebo
effect contributing to motor recovery was large and superior to fluoxetine alone. Furthermore, we found a different
neural signature of placebo and M1 rTMS in this trial supported by other prior trials we conducted. Additionally,
our laboratory was involved in other large trials with significant large placebo effects on motor learning. This
proposal will conduct an experimental trial in which 56 subjects with chronic stroke will be randomized into four
groups (2:2:2:1): open placebo alone (16 subjects), sham rTMS alone (hidden placebo) (16 subjects), no
treatment (16 subjects) and M1 rTMS alone (8 subjects). Subjects will be assessed before and after the
intervention using neurophysiological markers of connectivity to test specific mechanistic questions based on
our preliminary data. We will use quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of prefrontal and
sensorimotor areas and single and, secondarily, paired-pulse TMS to assess corticospinal and intracortical
excitability. Our hypothesis is that placebo (open and hidden) will have a specific EEG/neural signature
characterized by an enhancement in left frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) EEG and an increased beta band
premotor-motor EEG connectivity. Based on this, we will test two aims: Aim 1: Evaluate whether a hidden
placebo (placebo as given in a clinical trial indexed by sham rTMS) has a specific placebo EEG signature
compared to no treatment, and Aim 2: Evaluate whether also the open placebo (OP) has a specific EEG
signature compared to no treatment (similar to the hidden placebo). Moreover, secondarily, we will also evaluate
if active rTMS has a similar signature to sham rTMS and OP compared to no treatment. The significance of this
proposal is understanding the placebo effect in stroke patients. This will help improve the design of future stroke
trials. For instance, it could be used to design trials with unmatched placebos such as in a behavioral or surgical
trial where the active intervention is given against open placebo (unmatched placebo). If the neural signature of
placebo is known, this could be confirmed in the unmatched placebo arm to validate the results. Furthermore,
understanding mechanisms of placebo may also provide insights to develop interventions that would harness
these effects to induce motor recovery by targeting reward-motivation systems to enhance motor recovery in
stroke. This proposal is novel as we are developing and testing a new conceptual neural model of the role of
expectation and motivation in stroke recovery, and we are quantifying the placebo effects in motor recovery in
stroke in a well-controlled trial. Open placebo for motor recovery may open a new avenue for future treatments
in rehabilitation. Our team is a multidisciplinary group with solid research experience and environment, with
clinical expertise in different fields, such as neurology, electrophysiology, physical therapy, and psychiatry."
10770560,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the agent of Legionnaires disease pneumonia, which is increasing in incidence.
Previously, we showed that a chitinase (ChiA) secreted by the type II secretion system (T2SS) is needed for
optimal survival of Lp in lungs. Since chiA mutants were not impaired for intracellular infection of macrophages
or epithelia, we posited that ChiA mediates an overlooked extracellular event(s). Since chitin is not made by
mammals, we further surmised that ChiA is bi-functional and acts on a chitin-like factor in infected lungs. Thus,
we recently determined ChiA's structure, and functional analyses revealed a C-terminal domain (CTD) with the
chitinase active site. Yet, as we had hypothesized, the CTD also had a unique Zn-dependent, peptidase active
site that mediates the cleavage of mucins, including MUC5AC, a mucus gel-forming glycoprotein expressed in
lungs. Most significantly, we found that i) chiA mutant supernatants are deficient for cleavage of mucins and ii)
the chiA mutant is impaired for the ability to penetrate an in vitro mucin layer. Thus, we hypothesize that ChiA
promotes Lp dissemination through mucin layers in lungs as a step toward accessing its coveted intracellular
niches. Though mucinases have been studied in various bacteria, our work was the first documentation of a Lp
mucinase and one of the few defined for a lung pathogen or an intracellular parasite of macrophages and
epithelia. Extending our inquiry, we wondered if ChiA might also degrade mucin-like glycoproteins and found
that purified ChiA-CTD cleaves human C1-INH. Since C1-INH is a component of the complement system, we
hypothesize that ChiA may have yet another role in infection, i.e., promoting Lp's long-known but still poorly
understood resistance to complement-mediated killing. To our knowledge, ChiA currently stands alone as an
exoenzyme that degrades i) chitin, ii) gel-forming mucins of the lung, and iii) C1-INH of the human complement
system, besides aiding Lp in the lungs. Thus, this proposal will discern if ChiA-mediated degradation of mucin
promotes Lp access into human cells, if ChiA-mediated cleavage of C1-INH confers Lp resistance to killing by
human complement, and if the mucinase-peptidase domain vs the chitinase domain of ChiA fosters Lp growth
in lungs. Despite the link between ChiA and mucin, the chiA mutant did retain some mucin-degradation
activity, suggesting that Lp secretes additional proteins that act on gel-forming mucins. Thus, this proposal will
also seek to identify which of the other T2SS-dependent peptidases that we previously identified degrades
mucin and perhaps also complement components. Besides generating much-needed data on Lp mucinase-
peptidases and complement-resistance, this work will both improve our broad understanding of mucinases
during lung infection and intracellular parasitism and potentially reveal new targets for disease intervention."
10832068,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Multiplesclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediatedneurological disorder that affects one million people in
the United States. Up to 50% of patients with MS experience depression, yet the mechanisms of depression in
MS remain under-investigated. MS is characterized by white matter lesions, suggesting that brain network
disruption may underly depression symptoms. Studies of medically healthy participants with depression have
described associations between white matter variability and depressive symptoms, but frequently exclude
participants with medical comorbidities and thus cannot be extrapolated to people with intracranial diseases.
Previous research using lesion network mapping, a technique for mapping heterogeneous gray matter lesions
to neuropsychiatric symptoms, has demonstrated that strokes in gray matter associated with depression disrupt
a reproducible depression network. However, such techniques have never been applied to white matter disease
or MS. Studying white matter lesions associated with depression in MS may provide a way to understand both
the pathophysiology of depression in MS and general network mechanisms of depression more broadly. The
purpose of this current study is to investigate how brain network disruption underlies depression by learning from
the example of multiple sclerosis. In Aim 1, I will delineate how depression in adults with MS is associated with
white matter lesion location and burden in a retrospective sample of 1,554 MS patients with research-grade 3T
MRIs acquired as part of clinical care. Depression and MS diagnoses will be obtained from the electronic medical
record. While this sample provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, the electronic medical record does
not contain granular depression measures. In Aim 2, I will obtain structured clinical and cognitive assessments
for MS patients and prospectively evaluate white matter integrity as a predictor of dimensional depressive
symptoms. However, it is possible that symptoms of depression may reflect heterogenous brain network
disruption patterns. Therefore, in Aim 3, I will use advanced semi-supervised machine learning methods to parse
heterogeneity in MS white matter lesion burden in the retrospective sample and test whether this model predicts
phenotypic heterogeneity in our deeply-phenotyped prospective sample. The support of the K23 award will
provide the applicant with the training necessary to achieve these aims. The training objectives will be
accomplished with the support of an outstanding mentorship team, Drs. Satterthwaite, Shinohara, Bassett, Bar-
Or, Fox, McCoy, and the world class resources of the University of Pennsylvania. Together, the proposed
scientific aims and training objectives will form the foundation for an independent research program that will use
techniques from computational psychiatry to understand depression in patients with medical comorbidities."

in suicide attempts and deaths over time. The CL program is now being scaled through the Southwest Hub for
Youth Suicide Prevention (U19MH113136). As this program has scaled, our pilot work has revealed barriers to
implementation, including 1) challenges to risk identification, and 2) difficulties matching individuals’ level of
risk to evidence-based interventions as a means to improve scarce resource efficiencies. To help overcome
these barriers to implementation, NIMH funded our team to develop and pilot test NATIVE-RISE
(U19MH113136-02S3). NATIVE-RISE is a systems-level strategy that leverages predictive analytics to
enhance risk identification and integrates and improves the efficiency of local NA case managers who deliver
brief contact interventions. The proposed project will leverage our team’s historic MOU with Indian Health
Service (IHS) and decades-long trust-relationships with tribal partners to test NATIVE-RISE and its integration
in partnership with three NA-serving health care settings through a Hybrid Type III stepped-wedge cluster
randomized implementation trial. Specifically, this project aims to 1) optimize the implementation of NATIVE-
RISE across three NA-serving health care settings, 2) determine the effectiveness of NATIVE-RISE at
improving the reach of evidence-based suicide prevention services, and 3) describe the costs associated with
implementing NATIVE-RISE to inform scale-up and sustainability. Our application address key priority
populations for NIMH (NOT-MH-21-090) and is in line with NIMH’s strategic plan Objective 4.3. If results are
achieved, NATIVE-RISE will become an effective and scalable approach that improves services to prevent
suicide among NA populations and advances our understanding of how to implement predictive analytics and
more personalized care for suicide prevention."
10898035,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CANDIDATE: One of my long-standing interests is to understand the mediators of a successful antitumoral T
cell response. In this application, I am proposing a series of studies where I combine my graduate study
background in T cell biology with the expertise of the laboratory of my mentor Dr. Scott Lowe in in vivo cancer
modeling and tumor suppression. My research in the Lowe lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) has focused on how senescence, a common consequence of conventional anticancer therapies,
affects the function of T cells. Here I am delineating a plan for transitioning to independence that will allow me
to: (i) complete a set of experiments that are leading to discoveries I will be able to continue exploring as an
independent investigator; (ii) Acquire a set of expertise and further develop a research line that will separate me
from my present and past mentors and (iii) develop a series of professional skills needed for leading a lab.
RESEARCH: Cellular senescence in cancer cells is a stress-induced program that results in stable cell cycle
arrest and in secretion of a plethora of cytokines that can affect the behavior of other cells, including immune
cells. Senescence has been shown to have an immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive role in different
contexts. Cellular senescence is a common outcome of antitumoral therapies, yet the precise mechanisms by
which senescence alters adaptive anti-tumor immune responses remain largely unexplored. This project aims at
studying the functional consequences of senescence on T cells, utilizing novel model of cancer I have developed.
In Aim 1, I will explore how different drivers of senescence can lead to a T cell-infiltrated or a T cell-excluded
tumor microenvironment. In Aim 2 I will explore how an immunostimulatory form of senescence affects the
functionality of T cells that are specific for senescent and non-senescent cancer cells. These studies will inform
on how senescence can affect an antitumoral T cell response and on how to rationally design better anticancer
senescence-inducing approaches.
ENVIRONMENT: MSKCC provides an ideal environment for me to accomplish my training and research goals,
and successfully transition to an independent faculty position at an academic institution. My mentor Dr. Lowe is
a world leader in cancer biology, with a particular expertise on tumor suppressor programs, mouse models, and
functional genetics. In addition, I have assembled an advisory committee of three established scientists with
relevant and complementary expertise and strong commitment to mentoring (Drs. Pe’er, Rudensky, and Rosen),
who will support my transition to independence by providing valuable research and career guidance. Together
with the collaborative environment and broad spectrum of resources at MSKCC, this support network creates
optimal conditions for the successful completion of the proposed research and career development plans."
10862585,"REGION-SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY OF THE LEWY BODY DEMENTIA’S BRAIN
PROJECT SUMMARY
Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregation of the α-
synuclein (α-syn) into intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN). This form of
dementia belongs to a class of neurodegenerative diseases termed “synucleinopathies.” LBD is the most
common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. In LBD, dementia usually proceeds to the onset
of parkinsonian motor symptoms with neurobehavioral symptoms that may be accompanied by both cognitive
and motoric dysfunction. While various misfolded oligomers, primarily constituted of α-syn, are associated with
the development of dementia along with neuronal loss, there is still insufficient understanding of the pathogenesis
process. Especially, particular brain areas such as the limbic system and neocortex are more vulnerable than
other regions. Researchers have considered that the answer to this question will provide a key clue to
understanding the pathogenesis mechanism. Inter-cellular crosstalk of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes results
in complex physiologies and cellular behaviors, potentially leading to neuronal loss. Moreover, there is brain
region-specific heterogeneity in cellular populations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes that can contribute to
the region-specific vulnerability of the LBD brain. Therefore, information on cell-type-specific and single-cell-
specific proteome and transcriptome over multiple brain regions is indispensable for understanding this complex
mechanism. To study this complex mechanism, the selection of the right aminal model that best recapitulates
the human LBD pathogenesis process is crucial. The mouse model that recapitulates the Braak hypothesis would
serve as the best animal model and we recently have generated this mouse model (gut-brain α-syn model)
successfully by injecting α-syn to the gut. To study the regional vulnerability of LBD using the mouse model, we
propose 1) to study region- and cell-type-specific proteome of the brain of the gut-brain α-syn model using
BONCAT and xMD, 2) to study region- and single-cell-specific transcriptome of the brain of the gut-brain α-syn
model using HiF-snRNAseq, 3) to perform integrative bioinformatic analysis and validate the affected pathways
found in the mouse models using the human brain. Cell-type-specific proteome analysis and single-cell
transcriptome analyses over multiple brain regions of the gut-brain α-syn model proposed in this application will
enable us to identify region- and cell-type-specific signaling pathways that are involved in region-specific
vulnerabilities to pathological α-syn. This novel information will contribute to a better understanding of LBD
pathogenesis. Furthermore, these approaches can be expanded to studying pathogenesis mechanisms of other
neurodegenerative diseases."

Cancer  development  accompanies  with  the  dynamic  evolution  of  immunity,  a  well-­known  process  termed  as 
immunoediting.  However,  the  underlying  mechanisms  of  the  transition  between  each  phase,  from  immune 
surveillance to final escape, still remain a lot to discover. This proposal aims to study immunoediting during liver 
cancer development and progression, with a focus on senescence and metastasis. Senescence is a cell cycle 
arrest program that limits the expansion of damaged cells and can trigger anti-­tumor immunity that leads to their 
elimination  in  vivo,  serving as a  potent  barrier  to  tumorigenesis.  However,  during  tumor  initiation,  the effective 
clearance of senescent cells is compromised, warranting a deeper mechanistic understanding of this process. 
My doctoral research aims to identify critical molecular and cellular players driving anti-­tumor immune responses 
during senescence surveillance triggered by wildtype p53, which is known to modulates cancer immunity. The 
long-­term objective of my thesis project is to define the mechanisms of how senescent cells are susceptible to 
immune  surveillance  and  how  these  mechanisms  are  evaded  or  bypassed  during  cancer  development  and 
progression. As described in Specific Aims 1.1-­1.3, my thesis work has demonstrated that the p53 restoration 
triggers regression of liver cancers in an immunocompetent host. Using different immunodeficient mouse strains 
and pharmacological approaches perturbing specific immune compartments, our preliminary data suggests that 
adaptive  immunity  plays  a  key  role  in  senescence  surveillance.  RNA-­seq  and  mass  spectrometry  were 
conducted  on  both  proliferating  and  senescent  tumor  cells  and  revealed  several  senescence-­enriched  cell 
surface factors related to epithelial-­immune cell interactions. In Specific Aims 1.4 and 1.5, we aim to functionally 
interrogate  the  role  of  these  senescence-­induced  factors  as  novel  senescence  surveillance  effectors,  with  a 
focus on the regulatory network of antigen presentation pathway and, by exploiting multiplexed in vivo genetic 
screens established in the Lowe laboratory. My postdoctoral research will continue to study immunoediting with 
a slight change of the focus from the epithelial-­tumor angle to a more immunology-­rich perspective, applied to 
the problem of metastatic immune escape. The proposal aims to investigate the molecular changes of NK cells, 
shown to have control of early metastasis, after having physical interaction with metastatic cells. During different 
stages of  metastatic  colonization,  tumor-­engaging  NK  cells are  labeled  via  “SynNotch”  technology and  will  be 
subjected to single-­cell RNA-­seq to unveil the NK cell heterogeneity (Specific Aim 2.1) and ATAC-­seq to reveal 
potential  epigenetic  mechanisms  of  immune  exhaustion  with  functional  perturbation  of  the  altered  programs

11100664,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While immunotherapy is transforming cancer treatment, the majority of patients do not achieve durable
responses. We have been studying response and resistance to different immune checkpoint inhibitors and are
now poised to propose mechanistic studies aimed at providing an understanding of the immune states and
pathways that mediate or inhibit response to immune checkpoint blockade. Using high-dimensional unbiased
single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq), we can identify both canonical and non-canonical immune effectors that can
mediate anti-tumor responses. We believe that non-canonical effectors such as cytotoxic CD4 T cells, which we
have recently described, are not effectively triggered by our current treatments. Using the same single-cell
approaches, we can identify both known and novel cell types in cancer patients that can mediate immune
suppression. In our first objective, we will determine whether combination immunotherapies that include drug(s)
targeting specific immunosuppressive cells can enhance the function of these cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. By
leveraging neoadjuvant clinical trials where patients receive immunotherapy prior to surgery, we will use single
cell genomics and proteomics to define whether these combinations can 1) target the desired
immunosuppressive mechanisms, and 2) enhance canonical and/or non-canonical effectors within the resected
tumors. We will also use this approach to determine whether we can map these specific cell states into the
circulating compartment. The second objective is based on a longstanding interest in our group to define the
dynamics of antigen-specific responses. Using single-cell T cell receptor sequencing, we can identify expanded
T cell clones as well as follow their localization. In addition to understanding how immunotherapy combinations
induce and modulate specific T cell clonotypes within the tumor, we can determine how immunotherapies can
induce functional plasticity to desired or undesired states. The third objective builds on our 20 year experience
using mouse models to dissect mechanisms underlying response or resistance to immunotherapy. We will
determine the functional significance of non-canonical immune effectors using depletion and knock-out
strategies. We will also determine how combination immunotherapies can elicit both effective or ineffective anti-
tumor immune responses, thereby guiding the design of future clinical trials. In conclusion, our proposal is based
on hypothesis-driven bench-to-bedside and bedside-to-bench mechanistic studies with the goal of advancing
cancer immunotherapy. With our deep expertise in this field, experience leading multi-disciplinary teams focused
on translational research, and a rich network of basic science and clinical collaborators; we are uniquely
positioned to succeed in the research plan outlined in this proposal."

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are emerging
comorbidities of neuroHIV. The application is built on the most important findings from the
previous funding cycle and will evaluate the mechanistic events underlying the impact of HIV on
CSVD in relationship to TIA outcome and recovery (Aim 1) and HIV reactivation in the CNS and
its egress into the periphery (Aim 2). The significance of the proposed work drives primarily from
the facts that CSVD is the major cause of cognitive impairment, contributes to 25% of incidents
of brain ischemia, and more than doubles the risk of their recurrence. In addition, the risk of
developing transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or other forms of brain ischemia is estimated to be
at least 1.5-2-fold higher in HIV-positive individuals compared to the control population. The
central hypothesis of the present proposal is that HIV-induced cerebral vascular pathology
drives neuroimmune activation, predisposing HIV-infected brains to the development of
CSVD and more severe TIA outcomes. Mechanistically, we will focus on the impact of HIV and
CSVD on reprogramming of mitochondria and the role of dysfunctional mitochondria in these
events. Our important preliminary data indicates that HIV can be reactivated from latently infected
HIV brains, and we show for the first time that this process also occurs as the result of brain
ischemia. We will further explore these processes, and will evaluate if reactivated HIV in the CNS
can egress into the periphery. The proposed research is highly innovative by its focus on novel
mechanisms underlying vascular comorbidities, such as CSVD and TIAs, in the HIV-infected
brain.
When completed, our application will provide critical insight into the role of HIV in CSVD and TIA
development. In addition, our research will provide important information about the reactivation
HIV from the brain and seeding into the periphery as the result of brain ischemia. The proposed
studies are innovative and are likely to identify novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention."
10873087,"Project Summary – Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core (OREC)
The OREC of the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC) plays a key role in
achieving the goals of the IADRC through its community outreach and recruitment activities. It
also serves as an educational resource on AD and related dementias for healthcare
professionals, patients, caregivers, and family members living in Indiana, neighboring regions,
and beyond. As increasing numbers of older adults experience late life cognitive impairment and
associated challenges, outreach in our local and statewide community is crucial to inform them
and their families about the importance of early diagnosis, available treatment and management
options, and the critically important role of participating in research at the IADRC. The OREC
has developed numerous important relationships with health professionals and aging-related
organizations throughout the state, which increase the visibility and reach of our programs. The
IADRC and the OREC have had great success in increasing research participation in the
African American community and other underrepresented participant groups who are or may be
at higher risk for AD and related dementias. The IADRC understands the importance of building
rapport and trusting relationships with community members, health care and social service
providers. The OREC will build on its successfully developed foundation of community-based
collaboration over the past 30 years. The OREC has three overall goals: Outreach--to promote
the understanding of brain health and neurodegenerating diseases in Indiana, neighboring
regions and beyond; Recruitment--to facilitate recruitment of research participants to the IADRC
and related research studies; and Retention—to retain research participants in the IADRC and
related research studies. Our outreach programs greatly impact the increasing awareness of
dementing disorders, which in turn, increase the likelihood of participation in the IADRC,
providing support to the National Alzheimer’s Plan Act (NAPA) goal of preventing and effectively
treating AD by 2025."

The NIC of the IADRC will serve as a regional and national resource for the aging and neurodegeneration
research community by providing access to, and collaborative support for, the application of advanced
neuroimaging in clinical and translational research. The NIC has been productive in developing and
implementing cutting-edge protocols and techniques in neuroimaging and imaging genetics analysis,
collaborating with NIA-funded initiatives (e.g., ADNI, DIAN, ADGC, etc.), and in providing training in
neuroimaging and imaging genetics to scientists of all levels and disciplines. In this application, the NIC will
pursue the following specific aims: (1) Support funded research in the IADRC, IU Center for Aging Research,
and related programs that currently employ or could benefit from advanced neuroimaging; (2) Provide
standardized, state-of-the-art neuroimaging acquisition and analysis protocols; (3) Expand transdisciplinary
regional neuroscience research using advanced neuroimaging tools to study disease mechanisms and
treatments for neurodegeneration; (4) Support and collaborate with major national and international AD-related
research consortia using neuroimaging and genetics methods; (5) Provide transdisciplinary educational
opportunities in neuroimaging and genetics of AD and other degenerative disorders for basic and clinical
scientists at all levels from undergraduates to post-doctoral fellows and faculty, as well as dissemination of
neuroimaging results to the community. The NIC, working closely with the Clinical Core, will perform state-of-
the-art multimodal MRI (Siemens Prisma 3T: high resolution structural, 3D pCASL perfusion, multiband resting-
state and task-based fMRI, and hybrid diffusion and DTI optimized for structural and functional connectome
analysis) on all eligible IADRC participants, as well as amyloid and/or tau PET on >200 IADRC participants.
Participants in preclinical or early symptomatic phases (e.g., subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive
impairment), late-onset AD, and individuals from families with mutations causal for dementias will be
prioritized. Imaging-pathologic correlation when available will improve the understanding of early structural,
functional, and molecular changes observed in vivo and may help identify novel therapeutic targets. Cross-
modality image analyses and results of imaging genetics studies with ADNI, DIAN, and others will contribute to
advances in early detection, mechanistic understanding, and optimize imaging as a dynamic biomarker to
study therapeutic effects. Acquiring standardized state-of-the-art MRI and PET data for use by many
investigators will increase research productivity and facilitate quantitative analyses. Integration with other cores
will allow the IADRC to expand on these analyses by relating imaging biomarkers to neuropsychological
measures, neuropathologic samples, genetic and other –omics markers. The NIC will continue to foster and
support advanced imaging research through local, regional, and national/international collaborations. The NIC
will advance AD imaging research to meet the goal of NAPA for preventing and effectively treating AD by 2025."

10832087,"Project Summary
Lymphedema is a condition in which the clearance of lymph is compromised, resulting in edema and swelling of
limbs, with potentially devastating impact on quality of life and medical costs. The most common cause of
lymphedema in the US is from cancer-related surgery. Lymphedema is progressive and has no cure. It is not
known why some patients develop lymphedema while others do not. Studies of cadavers have shown that the
lymphatic anatomy can vary across individuals, and it is believed that these variations may increase the risk for
certain individuals to develop lymphedema. If this is true, steps may be taken to prevent lymphedema from
developing, for example with a bypass at the time of surgery. However, there is no practical way to obtain a
complete lymphatic anatomical map within an extremity in vivo. Current imaging techniques are limited by
penetration depth, low resolution, invasiveness, and partial coverage. The challenge is to map lymphatic
channels, with diameters of 0.4-0.8 mm, and to trace them from all regions of an extremity back to draining lymph
nodes. This proposal focuses on the development of a novel high resolution magnetic resonance (MR)
lymphography technique (hrMRL) for lymphatic mapping of the upper extremities in living people. hrMRL will be
a combination of a fast spin echo sequence with tailored variable flip angles, background subtraction, and
acceleration via undersampling with compressed sensing and deep learning. The first aim will be to construct
and optimize each of these components in an iterative fashion using phantoms, followed by testing on 10 healthy
subjects, with the goal of obtaining maps of the lymphatic channels of an entire extremity within a target time of
20 minutes, suitable for clinical adoption. In the second aim, hrMRL will first be used to obtain full lymphatic
anatomic maps of the upper extremity of 35 healthy volunteers who previously underwent indocyanine green
(ICG) lymphography, which will serve as a gold-standard reference. hrMRL will then be validated aginst ICG by
comparing both maps and determining their degree of agreement. hrMRL is also expected to resolve additional
lymphatic channels undetected by ICG, allowing us the opportunity to create more comprehensive maps and to
characterize new pathways, in particular the deep lymphatic channels. If successful, hrMRL would be
immediately impactful in the clinical setting, where it could guide measures to avoid onset of lymphedema,
shifting the lymphedema management algorithm from one of supportive and corrective therapies to one of
prevention, with the goal of reducing the incidence of this debilitating and costly disease."

Breast cancer is a devastating disease that affects large numbers of women annually; it is estimated that 1 in 8
women in the United States will be diagnosed with this disease during their lifetime. The five-year survival rate
for women diagnosed with localized or regional breast cancer is greater than 90 percent. However, the presence
of brain metastases reduces five-year survival rates to less than 10 percent. Chemotherapy treatment of brain
metastases is challenging and has yielded inferior results compared to tumors in the periphery, likely reflecting
the inability of chemotherapy to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or blood tumor barrier (BTB) at
efficacious rates. Recent studies demonstrate circadian regulation of BBB permeability; however no study has
examined whether temporal alterations in chemotherapy administration can improve the efficacy of treatment of
brain metastases. This project aims to take advantage of circadian control of BBB permeability by optimally
timing chemotherapy administration to increase anti-tumor efficacy and reduce adverse side effects of brain
metastases. Specifically, I hypothesize that circadian control of efflux transporter expression at the BBB underlies
the fluctuations in BBB/BTB permeability to chemotherapeutic agents. Permeability of two of the most commonly
prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer, doxorubicin (A) and paclitaxel (P), will be assessed via
phosphor autoradiography imaging by using 14C labeled chemotherapeutic drugs. Additionally, pharmacological
inhibition and genetic approaches (CRISPR) will be utilized to determine both the type and location (BBB or BTB)
of efflux transporters that underlie altered permeability. Mice harboring brain metastases of breast cancer will
receive intravenous injections of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide cocktail or paclitaxel every 2 weeks during either
the peak or trough of BBB permeability. Anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed via bioluminescence and
immunohistochemistry. Adverse behavioral effects of chemotherapy will be assessed via multiple behavioral
tasks and sleep assessment. I predict that optimal timing of chemotherapy administration will increase anti-tumor
efficacy and minimizes adverse side effects. Indeed, preliminary data demonstrate that altering only the timing
of injection increased the amount of chemotherapy within brain metastases of breast cancer by approximately
50%. Thus, chrono-chemotherapy represents a viable and novel treatment strategy. Together, these studies will
provide essential information with a high potential for clinical relevance to better treat patients with breast cancer.
This career development training award will enable me to become an independent investigator by allowing
training in emerging techniques (i.e., CRISPR and blood-brain barrier/blood-tumor barrier biology), professional
development, grant writing, guest lab training, mentor training, and highly focused research support. To help
accomplish my goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team that has extensive expertise in the
fields of circadian biology, cancer, and neuroscience."
10877819,"Abstract
 Dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In the
liver, this is manifested as the inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output, while de novo lipogenesis
remains elevated even in the fasted state but is still capable of displaying an insulin-stimulated increase. The
inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output while activating de novo lipogenesis has been referred to
as selective insulin resistance. The acute regulation of both gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis primarily
results from rapid changes in allosteric regulation, however, in chronic states such as insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes there are marked changes in gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. We have obtained
preliminary data indicating that the prototypical lipogenic genes (i.e. FASN, SCD1) are primarily regulated by
transcription initiation whereas gluconeogenic genes (i.e.: PCK1, G6Pc) are primarily regulated at the level of
transcriptional elongation. During diet induced hepatic insulin resistance, the elongation factor Spt5 is
functionally dysregulated thereby increasing gluconeogenic gene expression in the fed state. In addition, using
single cell RNAseq we have identified the differential engagement of different hepatocyte subsets during the
fasting/feeding cycle that are also altered during the development of hepatocyte insulin resistance. Based upon
these data, we propose two specific aims to examine several novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that
are important regulatory components of normal physiologic hepatocyte lipogenic and gluconeogenic gene
expression that are subsequently dysregulated during diet-induced insulin resistance. Specifically, we use 1)
ChIP-Seq to determine the changes in various initiation and elongation factors in their DNA occupancy
binding, 2) ATAC-Seq to determine chromatin organization, and 3) ChRO-Seq to directly measure the
rates of transcription across gene bodies. These analyses of total hepatocyte function will be
complemented with single cell molecular analyses that include 1) single cell RNA-Seq to directly determine
differential function of hepatocyte subsets, 2) single cell ATAC-Seq for individual hepatocyte
chromatin organization changes, and 3) single molecule FISH to assess individual cellular
transcriptional activity and identification of their anatomical zonation. These approaches will allow us to
determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the activation of transcriptional initiation and elongation
between lipogenic and gluconeogenic gene expression, and will expand our understanding of the individual
hepatocyte cellular responses that account for these changes in under normal fasting/feeding states and in
diet-induced liver insulin resistance."

10817956,"Abstract
Homeostasis and differentiation of adult mammalian spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) depend on tightly
regulated signal transduction through canonical pathways (e.g., RAS/ERK MAPK and PI3K/AKT). Disruption of
these pathways by pathogenic de novo mutations leads to changes in cell fitness and paternal age-related
accumulation of mutant SSC clones that generate craniofacial disorders in children. Recent studies in other
cell types show that dynamic patterns of signaling (on the scale of minutes to hours) are central to phenotypic
behavior of cells. Yet, the data for signaling requirements in SSCs until now have been derived from binary,
static measures, representing a major barrier to reconciling paradoxical observations regarding the roles of
specific pathways in SSCs. Furthermore, it has been difficult or impossible to link upstream signals (i.e., growth
factors) with specific downstream effectors due to parallel pathway activation, both in the context of normal
SSCs and those with pathogenic mutations. The general goal of this proposal is to develop novel methodology
to reveal how information is encoded by dynamic signaling patterns in SSCs, using kinase translocation
reporter technology (KTR), which enables quantitative, real-time measurement of pathway activity. As proof-
of-principle, we will apply this strategy to probe ERK MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling driven by canonical
receptor tyrosine kinases that are closely linked to self-renewal of SSCs, both in wild type cells and those with
mutations in genes that drive paternal age-associated craniofacial disorders. However, we anticipate our
results will be useful across a variety of pathways for revealing how extrinsic signals from the extracellular
environment are transmitted internally, dynamically encoded, and modified by network cross talk."

theories have been put forth, the molecular underpinnings of hippocampal neurodegeneration remain unclear.
This lack of understanding has stymied AD drug development from translating animal research into human
treatment. I believe that a translational cellular atlas that bridges the gap between mouse and human AD
research is needed to determine which specific hippocampal cell types are affected by AD. My previous research
creating the mouse Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA) lays a strong foundation for this effort
(Bienkowski et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2018). The HGEA defines 20 distinct genetic subdivisions of the
hippocampus and subiculum based on mapped gene expression patterns, delineates each region’s input/output
pathways, and demonstrates how each region contributes to brain-wide networks. Overall, I found that
hippocampal gene expression patterns were highly related to specific anatomical connectivity patterns. Among
many new insights, I discovered that subiculum gene expression patterns revealed hidden lamina of pyramidal
neurons and demonstrated how this laminar architecture underlies a columnar organization similar to the
cerebral cortex. Altogether, the HGEA demonstrates the multiscale organization of the hippocampus from
individual genetic cell types to neuronal networks regulating animal behavior. I established a number of
resources and tools on the Mouse Connectome Project website so that other hippocampal scientists around the
world could use the HGEA to guide their own research experiments. The funding of this K01 Mentored Research
Scientist Career Development Award application will provide me with training and expertise I need in order to
develop a human version of the HGEA as a translational resource to understand AD neurodegeneration. Building
on the mouse HGEA, the proposed research uses a cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics approach in thick
optically-cleared tissue sections (STARmap) to reveal multiplexed gene expression patterns, build a human
HGEA that can be registered to MRI data, and investigate changes to HGEA-defined neuronal cell types caused
by hippocampal neurodegeneration within an AD mouse model (5XFAD mice) and humans with AD. To guide
this project and my career development, I have assembled a world-class team of supportive mentors (Drs. Arthur
Toga and Berislav Zlokovic) and collaborators (Dr. Carol Miller) to provide me with new training to investigate
Alzheimer’s disease in both transgenic mouse models and human post-mortem tissue. Ultimately, the funding of
this K01 proposal will complete my career development toward leading a translational neuroscience laboratory
studying the relationship of gene expression, connectivity, and behavior in neurological disease."

Over the past decade, malaria elimination has re-emerged atop the global health agenda, with most countries
setting goals to be malaria-free within two decades. However, major obstacles remain, including “getting to
zero” in regions that have achieved pre-elimination status but remain surrounded by areas of ongoing
transmission. As these regions near elimination, they are often “vulnerable” to re-introduction of malaria from
nearby areas and “receptive” as they have the right ecology to support transmission. The Zanzibar Archipelago
is one of these regions. Despite robust vector control and access to efficacious antimalarial treatment, its
proximity to mainland Tanzania has made elimination difficult. Specifically, eliminating malaria on the
archipelago requires a better understanding of why and where importation is occurring and understanding the
factors that promote local transmission. This proposal will overlay genomic studies onto ongoing Zanzibar
Malaria Elimination Program (ZAMEP) passive surveillance and reactive case detection (RCD) activities to
identify foci of imported cases on the islands (Aim 1A), model the relationship between human travel, parasite
genetics and importation (Aim 1B), determine the extent of secondary transmission from index cases (Aim 2A),
and show the limits of RCD in detecting index cases and capturing parasite outbreaks (Aim 2B). Samples will
be collected from every reported case on the archipelago and 10 sites on mainland Tanzania. Additionally,
enhanced RCD - screening households surrounding a reported index case, both 1 and 4 weeks later - will be
carried out in order to capture secondary asymptomatic cases, including those infected but with prepatent
infection, as well as those yet to be inoculated by infected mosquitoes at the time of first RCD. We will deploy
novel efficient high throughput sequencing methods that enable genotyping of thousands of samples on a
genome-wide basis. This strategy is much cheaper than whole genome sequencing but still provides the
resolution needed to use identity-by-descent analyses to infer relationships between highly related parasites.
These methods will allow us to define individual and community risk factors for importation, as well as
intervenable risk factors that impact the extent of local transmission arising from importation. Combined with
geospatial data on human mobility patterns, we will achieve a deeper understanding of the drivers of
importation and secondary transmission that will allow ZAMEP to tailor interventions at a local level. This study
leverages an existing productive collaboration between leading academic institutions (UNC, Brown, Imperial,
MUHAS) and ZAMEP to tackle questions cited amongst the highest research priorities for the WHO and other
bodies that guide malaria research. As all malaria endemic countries will face the last mile of malaria
elimination, whether now or in the future, we expect completion of the aims in this proposal to have a direct
impact on global malaria policies."

Substance use (SU) is most commonly initiated during adolescence. Earlier age of onset is associated with
more significant and persistent adverse outcomes, such as impaired psychosocial and educational functioning,
myriad health consequences, and long-term struggles with SU and addiction — underscoring the critical need
to identify and intervene on SU as early as possible. Thus, the public health need to increase availability and
quality of evidence-based interventions for adolescents (ADOL) who are using substances cannot be
overstated, especially in Rhode Island where ADOL are not receiving substance use disorder treatment that
they need at higher than national averages. This proposal not only aims to increase access to interventions for
ADOL using substances but also improve brief interventions for ADOL by co-addressing pain in an innovative
pre-surgical context. Acutely painful procedures, such as wisdom tooth extraction, are an opportune time to
identify SU behaviors and engage ADOL in brief intervention due to shared risk factors between SU and pain
and the potential for exposure to prescription opioids. Aim 1 is to adapt and integrate pre-existing evidence-
based brief interventions for adolescent SU (MET-CBT) and acute pain coping (CBT) into a pre-surgical brief
intervention (PS-BI) for ADOL and their parents. PS-BI will be developed by the PI and her interdisciplinary
mentorship team in conjunction with feedback from key informants (e.g. ADOL, parents, and dental providers).
Aim 2 will evaluate PS-BI in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) versus a control condition of current best
practice among ADOL (age 15-18 years) who use cannabis (and other substances) undergoing wisdom tooth
extraction. Key outcomes for the pilot RCT (Aim 2) are feasibility and acceptability. Ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) methods will be used to elucidate associations between pain, craving, and SU (Aim 3) and
explore if those associations are attenuated by PS-BI (Exploratory aim). This will be the first test of within-
person associations of hypothesized precursors (e.g., pain intensity), substance craving, and use in the
perioperative context among ADOL who use substances. A highly structured training plan will ensure execution
of the proposed research aims. Specifically, the PI will receive advanced training in (1) intervention
development and clinical trial methods, (2) integrated SU interventions for ADOL, (3) EMA, (4) advanced
statistical approaches, including longitudinal data analysis, and (5) mentoring and leadership skills to combine
with her expertise in pediatric psychology, interdisciplinary collaboration in medical settings, and pediatric pain.
Training will be guided by a stellar mentorship team with highly relevant expertise and long-standing track
records of successful mentorship. The proposed research and training plan is further supported by the rich
training environment at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University. Through this K23, the
PI will obtain specialized training to launch her independent research focused on developing, evaluating, and
implementing innovative interventions for adolescent SU and pain in integrated care settings."

The overall goal of the Kansas Center for Metabolism and Obesity REsearch (KC-MORE) COBRE program is 
to establish a multidisciplinary research center focused on expanding our knowledge for the treatment and 
prevention of obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and obesity-associated disease states. The formation of the Center 
will create the infrastructure to bring existing research strengths together to grow a self-sustaining research 
community. In phase one, the KC-MORE will consist of a group of four Research Project Leaders (RPLs), three 
scientific cores, a public seminar series and annual symposium, a Mentorship and Career Development 
Program, a Pilot Awards Program, and a Diversity and Inclusion Program. A seven-member Steering Committee 
made up of the two multi-PIs and the Core and Program Directors will govern and manage the Center with advice 
and input from an External Advisory Committee (EAC) that will consist of five experts in the field. The KC-MORE 
will partner with the University and academic departments to develop obesity and metabolism research at the 
University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). The Administrative core will be responsible for the overall 
management of the administrative, fiscal, educational, and scientific aspects of the KC-MORE. This Core will 
play an important leadership role by setting the overall scientific direction of the Center’s activities, coordinating 
and integrating the Center’s functions, and promoting internal and external collaborative interactions. The 
Administrative core will strengthen interactions between the KC-MORE COBRE and the institution by interfacing 
its activities with other programs, centers, and institutes at KUMC, and by integrating the research cores with 
existing institutional shared resource centers and cores. The Administrative core will be responsible for 
coordinating the leadership activities, arranging for the EAC meetings and program evaluations, providing 
administrative and accounting support to the RPLs and cores, and developing and administering the seminar 
series and educational programs. In addition, the core will also house three critical additional activities. These 
are the formal mentoring program, an annual pilot awards program, and a diversity and inclusion program. The 
overall aims of the Administrative core include the following: creating the infrastructure necessary for center 
oversight, providing financial and administrative management to the Center, leading the mentoring and career 
development program, and conducting an annual pilot awards program."
10898909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research shows that environmental exposures during sensitive life periods affect key physiological processes
that orchestrate the development of multiple organ systems, including brain development and growth/obesity.
The perinatal period is particularly important, as cells and tissues differentiate most rapidly then. Inhibitory
control and negative affect (i.e. depression, anxiety) have been linked to obesity, although most research is
cross-sectional or in adults. Brain development and later life obesity may have roots in perinatal life- consistent
with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease concept (DOHaD). There is substantial overlap among
perinatal environmental risk factors for depression/anxiety, learning disabilities and obesity. Despite shared
vulnerabilities, no studies have addressed if perinatal environmental exposures create a temporally dependent
network linking obesity with negative affect and inhibitory control, nor have they addressed the sequential
nature of their relationships during child life stages that predate adolescent obesity. Bringing all these concepts
and observations together, we propose that prevalent, perinatal neurotoxic exposures to air pollution and
psychological stress program adolescent obesity by first causing obesity associated neurophenotypes that
arise in children prior to adolescence, the age at which obesity incidence peaks. Because neurophenotypes
are continuous and overlapping, we use transdiagnostic approaches to better capture the relationships among
environment, behavior and obesity. Our proposed framework means that longitudinal pathways from
environment to later onset disease should consider other phenotypic traits as intermediates in a larger causal
pathway that arises during age dependent developmental stages. We believe this is a paradigm shifting
concept in neurodevelopment and obesity research that can unify several widely observed relationships. In
addition, the path from environment to behavior to obesity may depend as much on exposure timing as on
differences in exposure levels. We combine prospective longitudinal exposure measures of perinatal stress
and air pollution with novel statistical approaches to allow us to objectively define susceptibility windows. We
conduct this work in PROGRESS, a prospective child health cohort that has collected longitudinal exposure,
covariate and phenotype data from pregnancy to age 12 years already. In this proposal, we will assess the role
of perinatal environment, negative affect and inhibitory control on obesity phenotypes from 13-16 years, an age
during which child obesity rates rise dramatically, ensuring adequate power and justifying data collection in an
additional grant cycle. Only a cohort like PROGRESS with longitudinal, prospective measures starting in
perinatal life across multiple health domains and across time could address these questions on adolescent
health in a single 5 year grant. In sum, we will explain connections among metabolic, neurobehavioral and
mental health phenotypes that share vulnerability to similar perinatal environmental factors but are usually
studied separately or cross-sectionally."
10854803,"1 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, presents with
2 anovulation and hyperandrogenism in adolescence. In addition to reproductive abnormalities, PCOS is
 3 frequently associated with obesity and metabolic complications including diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver
 4 disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Additionally, women with PCOS are more
 5 likely to suffer from mental health disorders and significant dermatologic manifestations. PCOS is a chronic
 6 heterogeneous familial disorder and thus symptoms, signs and co-morbidities at time of diagnosis vary. Despite
 7 the high prevalence and gravity of comorbidities associated with PCOS, widely effective therapeutic options are
8 lacking. Recommended therapies for PCOS treatment in women not seeking pregnancy include estrogen
 9 containing contraceptives (EC), lifestyle modification, and metformin. Recently there has been a call for more
10 individualized and personalized therapeutic approaches, however there is little biologic basis to recommend one
11 therapy over another. Further, despite the availability of these treatment options for over 40 years, research on
12 their efficacy in youth with PCOS is limited to small studies. Additionally, due to puberty specific hormone
13 changes, adolescents have lower insulin sensitivity than adults. Indeed, a number of studies have established
14 that youth with diabetes or obesity respond less to metformin than adults. Thus, data from medication trials in
15 adult women cannot be applied in youth with PCOS.
16 No mechanism is currently available in the United States to query the early natural history and response to
17 existing medications in a diverse population of youth with PCOS. Using
18 institutions, e found that reproductive abnormalities are more severe in girls without obesity, and metabolic
19 co-morbidities are more common in girls with obesity. Additionally, we and others have found that PCOS
20 presentation, especially as relates to comorbidities, may reflect underling racial and ethnic differences. The
21 overall goal of the project is to describe the presenting reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, natural history,
22 and response to therapy in a large sample of geographically, ethnically and racially diverse youth with PCOS. We
23 hypothesize that presentations of PCOS in adolescence will vary by family history, obesity, and race and ethnicity
24 status, and that unique factors at diagnosis can be used to identify those that respond to EC, metformin or
25 lifestyle therapies. SA1) Describe the presentation and co-morbidities at the time of diagnosis of PCOS in youth
26 in the United States SA2) Determine the response to common medications (lifestyle, EC, metformin). This
27 cohort represents a very diverse population of youth with PCOS, and the database is the first of its kind for youth
28 with PCOS. This work will establish how early phenotypes can inform more individualized approaches toward
29 initial therapy. These efforts are a critical first step towards developing data-informed personalized treatment

7. PROJECT SUMMARY
Cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based structures that protrude from the apical cell surface to
perform important biological functions, ranging from signal transduction to fluid movement. The sperm flagellum
is a modified motile cilium that is essential for locomotion and fertilization of the egg. As such, abnormal sperm
flagella are one of the leading causes of male infertility. Although not completely equivalent, analogous
mechanisms are thought to operate during flagellogenesis and ciliogenesis. Defective ciliogenesis is associated
with human disorders, known as ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, and many of the male patients
also show fertility issues. Despite worldwide research efforts to elucidate the role of ciliary proteins in these
diseases, their physiological roles in male fertility remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that
mice lacking the key ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1) exhibit ciliopathy phenotypes. Molecularly, Cby1 interacts
with membrane-binding BAR domain proteins, called Cby1-interacting BAR domain-containing 1 and 2 (ciBAR1
and 2, formerly known as FAM92A and B), to facilitate ciliogenesis. More recently, we found that a Cby family
member, Cby1-Like (Cby1L, also known as Cby3), is expressed abundantly and exclusively in the testis.
Interestingly, Cby1L localizes to the annulus, a septin-based ring structure at the midpiece/principal piece
(MP/PP) junction in the sperm tail, in the testis. To gain insight into the in vivo function of Cby1L during
spermatogenesis, we created Cby1L-/- mice and found that male mice are completely infertile with the majority
of sperm showing kinked tails around the MP/PP junction. Curiously, in the sperm from Cby1L-/- mice, the annulus
is present but fails to stop at the MP/PP junction and progresses into the PP. Although the annulus is tightly
bound to membranes during its migration, in Cby1L-/- testis, the annulus is partially detached from the flagellar
membrane, suggesting that Cby1L is involved in anchoring the annulus to the membrane. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we found that Cby1L physically interacts with ciBAR1 as well as the annulus septin SEPT4.
Furthermore, we found that ciBAR1 localizes to the annulus, and ciBAR1-/- male mice are infertile, producing
sperm with kinked tails. Collectively, our preliminary data suggest an exciting working model in which Cby1L in
a complex with ciBAR1 stably anchors the annulus to flagellar membranes during its caudal migration and
precisely positions it at the MP/PP junction likely via membrane shaping and constriction. The overall goal of this
application is to understand the molecular roles of Cby1L and its binding proteins in spermatogenesis and male
fertility. To achieve this goal, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Investigate the role of Cby1L in
flagellogenesis using a Cby1L-/- mouse model; 2) Investigate the involvement of ciBAR1 in flagellogenesis and
male fertility; and 3) Identify novel Cby1L-binding proteins and characterize their functions during flagellogenesis.
We anticipate that our proposed research will unravel a novel mechanism underlying the proper
compartmentalization of the sperm tail by ciliary proteins."

In recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) under the age of 50 years has increased significantly
and population-based screening is currently not offered to persons under 50 years. Consequently, persons
with early-onset (<50 years) CRC (EOCRC) more frequently present with symptomatic disease at advanced
stages (III/IV) resulting in greater loss of life in young cases. In 2020, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommended the age for CRC screening by colonoscopy or fecal tests be reduced to 45 years. However, the
uptake of screening by these methods in all screen-eligible populations is low, including in those <50 years
who are genetically at high risk, so adherence in the asymptomatic population <50 years is also likely to be
low. Also, over half of EOCRC occur in persons under <45 years of age, where no such screening would be
offered. A minimally invasive, blood-based screening test for EOCRC would provide a cost-effective and
patient-friendly option for triaging and identifying those warranting a follow-up colonoscopy, while increasing
screening adherence in the younger population. Cancer-specific methylated DNA biomarkers are highly suited
for population-based cancer screening via the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood plasma
because they are more prevalent across patients with a given cancer type than tumor mutations and are more
stable (nuclease-resistant) in plasma. The methylated SEPTIN9 plasma ctDNA test, “mSEPT9” (Epi proColon
V2.0, Epigenomics), is FDA-approved for CRC screening in persons aged ≥50 years who decline colonoscopy
and fecal tests. This test urgently needs to be assessed in persons <50 years to determine its suitability for the
detection of EOCRC. Even so, a multi-marker test is likely to have superior sensitivity to a single-marker test.
Thus, the objectives of our study are to identify and confirm a panel of methylated ctDNA markers for the
plasma-based detection of EOCRC, and to compare the diagnostic performance of this panel to the mSEPT9
test in persons <50 years of age. In Aim 1, we will identify the most prevalent differentially-methylated (tumor
vs. normal) DNA markers in CRC cases <50 years by performing deep Methyl-Seq across 4.2 million CpG
sites in paired primary tumor vs. normal colon tissues from EOCRC cases, and leukocytes from healthy
controls (to filter out non-specific markers). The identified markers will be validated in independent sample
series. For the top-ranked markers, we will then develop methylation-specific real-time PCR assays with high
analytical sensitivity and test these in pooled plasma from metastatic CRC cases (to select markers producing
the strongest signals) and healthy controls (to eliminate any producing low-level non-specific signals) to finalize
the marker panel. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the diagnostic performance characteristics of the mSEPT9 test vs.
the multi-marker panel test in plasma from colonoscopy-verified CRC cases and controls <50 years. This study
will yield a multi-marker methylated ctDNA panel with improved diagnostic performance over the single-marker
mSEPT9 test for cost-effective, blood-based, CRC screening in asymptomatic persons <50 years of age."

Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a pathogenesis that affects 6 to 7 million
people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. There is no effective treatment for chronic Chagas disease and
resistant strains to the current frontline treatment have already emerged. There is a growing need for new
pharmacological alternatives to treat this disease.
 This proposal exploits a target-based approach to search for lead compounds against Chagas
disease. Trypanosoma cruzi dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (TcDHODH) is a flavin mononucleotide
containing enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of L-dihydroorotate to orotate, the fourth step and only
redox reaction in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. TcDHODH was also described as a
soluble fumarate reductase playing a role in connecting succinate/fumarate metabolism to de novo pyrimidine
biosynthesis. DHODH has already been extensively exploited as a drug target for proliferative and parasitic
diseases. Genetic studies have shown that DHODH is essential for T. cruzi survival providing evidence that
this enzyme is an attractive target for the development of antichagasic drugs.
 The goal of this project is to chemically validate TcDHODH as a new drug target for Chagas disease
and to provide leads for drug development. Our approach combines multiple techniques including
computational chemistry, enzymology, structural biology, parasitology, and medicinal chemistry to develop
selective and covalent inhibitors of TcDHODH. Initially, we will seek to gain a greater understanding of the
DHODH hot spots by using solvent mapping to characterize the binding pockets with the flexible active-site
loop open and closed. This information will help strengthen the computational modeling, and subsequent
compound design.
 Covalent inhibition of enzymes based on the identification of a set of cysteine targeting covalent
warheads including acrylamides, vinyl sulfones and nitriles, has been shown to be a successful approach in
drug discovery pipelines. In our proposal, an initial set of putative inhibitors that incorporate an acrylamide
warhead have already been rationally designed to target the TcDHODH active-site cysteine. Predicted
inhibitors will be evaluated for inhibitory potency and mechanism of inhibition against TcDHODH, cytotoxicity
and its anti-parasitic effects in cell culture. X-ray crystallography, fragment screening and medicinal chemistry
will be combined to provide the chemical basis for the synthesis of a new generation of potent, selective, and
drug-like inhibitors. The top 3 inhibitors that meet lead criteria (including PK and tolerability) will have their
efficacy evaluated by DNDi via an in-kind contribution to the project.
 This proposal represents an unprecedent initiative to significantly contribute to building capacity in the
field of drug discovery in Brazil, a field of research still very incipient in developing countries."

Pathogenic tau in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias inhibits the plasticity of neuronal connections
underlying progressive memory loss. What remains undetermined, however, are the complex and multifactorial
molecular events that disrupt synaptic plasticity in neurons with pathogenic tau. This is major gap in our
knowledge of the molecular and physiological processes underlying memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias. There is a critical need to uncover how plasticity is dysregulated by pathogenic tau to lay the
groundwork for new strategies to target plasticity for therapeutic intervention in these diseases. Long-term
potentiation (LTP) is a type of plasticity that involves the persistent strengthening of specific connections between
neurons in response to increased activity. There is a strong link between memory impairments and obstructed
LTP at synapses in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, suggesting that the
inability of synapses to express LTP is a key factor leading to memory decline. Our preliminary studies suggest
that pathogenic tau blocks the activity-dependent de novo protein synthesis in dendrites that is required for LTP
expression. Moreover, we found that pathogenic tau downregulates a translation initiation factor that controls
activity-dependent mRNA translation during plasticity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that pathogenic
tau blocks the initiation of local protein translation in dendrites and thereby disrupts the dynamics of postsynaptic
proteins that establish LTP and the encoding of new memories. To delineate the mechanism by which pathogenic
tau inhibits LTP expression, we propose to use both human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cultured
neurons with familial tau mutations, V337M and R406W, that cause dementia and the PS19 tauopathy mouse
model. We will establish the effect of pathogenic tau on the active translation of mRNAs into newly synthesized
proteins during LTP expression. We will use a combination of methods to monitor the effect of tau on the rate of
protein synthesis and on the subset of mRNAs that are actively translated during LTP. We will next determine
the impact of pathogenic tau on a critical step in the initiation of protein translation and the extent to which
restoring activity-dependent translation initiation can ameliorate LTP and memory impairments in PS19 mice
assessed by electrophysiological recordings and behavioral tests of learning and memory. Finally, we will use
an unbiased and innovative APEX proteomics approach to establish the impact of pathogenic tau on the dynamic
changes in the postsynaptic protein composition during LTP expression that involve both de novo protein
synthesis and the reorganization of protein composition to enhance synaptic strength. From these studies, we
expect to elucidate the effect of pathogenic tau on dendritic protein synthesis and the regulation of postsynaptic
protein dynamics that underlie the complex and multifactorial causes of memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias."
10898588,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 High blood pressure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and greatly contributes to a
multitude of cardiovascular disease. Although the renal sympathetic nerves have been the focus of many basic
and clinical studies, the role of the renal afferent (sensory) nerves in mediating hypertension remains poorly
understood. Activation of renal afferents can potentially either excite or inhibit global sympathetic nerve activity
and thereby increase or decrease blood pressure, but the precise mechanisms controlling the balance of the
excitatory vs. inhibitory reflex actions of the renal afferent nerves are currently unknown. We have recently
determined that the endothelin-1 (ET-1) system significantly modulates renal afferent nerves. Our central
hypothesis is that endothelin A (ETA) receptor activation on renal afferent nerves increases sympathetic
nerve activity and blood pressure, and that endothelin B (ETB) receptor activation on renal afferent
nerves decreases sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. We will test this hypothesis using rodent
models in the settings of both normal physiology and hypertension. ETA or ETB receptors on renal nerves will be
directly activated in rats instrumented with radiotelemetry devices, which allow for recording of blood pressure
and markers of sympathetic nerve activity in unrestrained, conscious animals. These experiments, which will
also include in vitro culturing, imaging, and electrophysiological examination of renal afferent nerves will provide
important new information about the mechanisms of afferent nerve activation.
 High salt and high fat content are common features of the typical Western diet and are well-known to
play a role in the development of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Our preliminary evidence
indicates that these factors also increase renal afferent nerve expression of ET-1 and ETA receptors. Because
of this connection to increases in abberant renal afferent nerve activity and blood pressure, we will also test the
hypothesis that high salt or high fat diet increases afferent nerve ET-1 expression and a preponderance
of ETA to ETB receptor signaling promoting increased afferent nerve activity, sympathetic tone, and blood
pressure. This hypothesis will be tested through the use of rat models with specific pharmacological inhibition
of ETA and/or ETB receptors on renal afferent nerves, and animals will be fed a high salt or high fat diet.
 Together, these studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of how excitation versus inhibition of
renal afferent nerves contributes to hypertension and thus could lead to specific and efficient therapeutic
interventions for the treatment of hypertension. This research study and the proposed mentored training plan will
provide the applicant with the specific scientific training needed for successful transition into independence."

Over the past two decades, a number of “super-resolution” 3D imaging technologies have been developed,
enabling researchers to observe nanoscale biological structures that were previously invisible to traditional,
diffraction-limited imaging techniques. The ability to visualize cellular and subcellular structures at the nanoscale
has revealed key insights into a variety of biological processes. Although impressive progress has been made
in the development of 3D super-resolution imaging techniques, researchers are often forced to accept a tradeoff
in terms of the resolution, field-of-view, speed, and ease of use of their 3D imaging technique. Recently, we have
developed an acoustofluidic scanning nanoscope that can simultaneously achieve both super-resolution and
large field-of-view imaging in 2D. In this R01 project, we will develop and validate a 3D acoustofluidic scanning
nanoscope with the following features: (1) Super-resolution imaging with lateral and axial resolutions of ~50
nm and ~120 nm, respectively: The proposed 3D imaging method will achieve a resolution that is four times
better than that from a confocal microscope, which makes the optical imaging of more detailed inner architecture
of many subcellular structures possible; (2) Large field-of-view (~1,100×1,100 µm2): Conventional optical
imaging methods achieve high-throughput imaging at the cost of reduced resolution and vice versa. By utilizing
acoustics to simultaneously manipulate multiple microsphere lenses, the proposed imaging method will solve
this long-standing technical barrier for large field-of-view imaging while maintaining superior lateral and axial
resolution; (3) Imaging speed 10 times faster than that from a confocal microscope: Rapid z-stacking at a
speed 10 times faster than that of a confocal microscope can be achieved by using surface acoustic waves to
scan an array of microspheres across the sample volume in a precise, controllable manner; (4) Seamless
connection to a conventional optical microscope for ease of use: Our device can be seamlessly connected
to a conventional optical microscope without modification of the optical setup, which can significantly reduce the
cost and the complexity of operation. With the aforementioned advantages, the proposed 3D acoustofluidic
scanning nanoscope technology has the potential to significantly exceed current standards in the field and
address many unmet needs. We will validate its performance by imaging 3D nanorod samples and the organelles
of live HeLa cells. In this regard, we aim to demonstrate the far-reaching potential of our 3D acoustofluidic
scanning nanoscope technology to enable improved research in areas ranging from subcellular imaging to the
visualization of 3D neural activity."
10902002,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and together with cerebrovascular
diseases account for over 28% of total deaths in the United States. Acute cardiac events (e.g., myocardial
infarction, stress cardiomyopathy, and sudden cardiac death) are concerning because of their unpredictability
and the lack of knowledge regarding causative mechanisms. Psychosocial stressors (e.g., anxiety, personality
traits, social isolation) overburden the cardiovascular system and are risk factors for cardiovascular events and
stroke. Characterization of heart-brain interactions in the context of psychosocial stress is an important first
step in identifying gene-environment interactions that are associated with increased disease risk. Researchers
have proposed that emotional and psychosocial stress may lead to a sympathetic-catecholaminergic surge that
decreases myocyte viability and/or cardiac function. Hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and the V1A
receptor (V1AR) have great therapeutic potential for psychosocial stress-associated heart disease, as AVP
and its receptors promote health and survival by regulating neuroendocrine stress responses. The main thesis
of this proposal is that AVP, acting via the V1AR, promotes health and wellbeing by dynamically modulating
neural responses in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to stressors. AVP is linked to stress-related disorders in
humans and altered emotional reactivity in animals, that can be modulated by antipsychotic treatment,
suggesting an AVP-VTA interaction in stress-associated responses. However, the neural mechanisms that
underlie the relationships among AVP, Avpr1a gene expression, VTA-dependent stress responses, and
cardiovascular function have not been fully characterized. To address this gap in knowledge, the major goals
of this proposal are to investigate the cardioprotective properties of the neuropeptide AVP and
determine whether there is an association between the Avpr1a gene expression, catecholamine
release, and heart disease outcomes in a psychosocial stress-induced myocardial injury animal model.
Many susceptible individuals are exposed to multiple risk factors that often interact with each other, magnifying
cardiovascular disease risk. Using the Syrian hamster, I plan to investigate the interaction between two
psychosocial risk factors, social isolation and aggression. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that AVP in the VTA
blocks stress-induced catecholamine release and exacerbation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and
aim 2 will test the hypothesis that V1AR gene expression patterns will predict response to stress and AVP-
treatment on heart injury and catecholamines. The trainee will also participate in career development activities:
learn how to perform myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury surgeries and conduct gene expression studies;
participate in a formal career development program; participate in a special program in cardiovascular genetics
and epidemiology; complete scientific courses to gain new knowledge; improve grant writing skills by receiving
mentorship from experienced investigators; and establish a successful independent research program."

Blood and marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective cure for many life-threatening hematologic diseases. Survival
after BMT has improved dramatically over the past two decades, however up to 40% of patients still die within
one year after HLA-matched unrelated donor allogeneic BMT. This project will build upon our prior genome-wide
(GWAS) and exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) involving ~2,900 patients named Determining the
Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT (DISCOVeRY-BMT).
Our GWAS identified several donor loci that significantly increased recipient’s risk of disease-related mortality
(DRM) and donor-recipient genotype mismatches significantly increased risk of transplant-related mortality
(TRM) in European Americans (EAs). Our ExWAS discovered a rare nonsynonymous coding variant, where a
donor-recipient genotype mismatch correlated with TRM and additional novel genes (e.g. TEX38, OR51D1, and
NT5E) correlated with overall survival, TRM and DRM. Our goal for this proposal is two-fold: to deepen our
understanding of non-HLA genetic contributors to BMT mortality, and to build the clinical-genomic prognostic
models to translate such understanding into clinical practice. The first goal will be fulfilled in two directions. 1)
We will systematically survey both rare and common variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and meta-
GWAS in EAs as well as under-studied diverse populations in an effort to bridge the BMT survival disparity
between EAs, African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Our prior ExWAS in EAs demonstrated the important
roles played by rare coding variants in BMT mortality, however, only 2% of rare variants are in the exome array.
Therefore, we will use WES to assay all exonic variants in 5,598 multi-ethnic donor-recipient pairs. As the
variants/genes we identify are direct candidates for causality, functional validation will be performed to
investigate such relationships. In parallel, we will perform the largest meta-GWAS of BMT mortality to date.
Through our collaborations, we have assembled all BMT GWAS data available in the US (8,576 donor-recipient
pairs including 1,978 minority pairs). 2) We will interrogate WES and GWAS data to further reveal the biological
networks contributing to BMT mortality. To meet the second goal, we will leverage our unique and powerful
GWAS resource to develop prognostic models to predict patients’ personalized mortality risk. This is the first
study to use next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the contribution of non-HLA coding variants on
post-BMT mortality. GWAS data on 8,576 donor-recipient pairs, of which 5,598 pairs also have WES data, will
make this the largest genetic study ever undertaken, and provide a real opportunity to understand the genetics
of BMT mortality across diverse populations. The prognostic models we develop will provide a valuable tool to
help reduce BMT mortality and enhance donor-recipient matching in routine clinical practice. Importantly, the
data generated by this project will be shared publicly to serve as a resource for additional research to improve
survivorship after BMT and enhance the public investment in this project."
10892227,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal describes our research training program in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine
(PCCM) at OHSU. In this program, we offer a multidisciplinary approach to pulmonary research and medicine
that integrates state-of-the-art basic science, clinical trials, and patient outcomes research. Three postdoctoral
fellows (MD or PhD) and three graduate students will be offered one and possibly two years of research
funding.
Research will be supplemented by trainee participation in program-wide research seminars, journal clubs, and
didactic coursework. It is our belief that such program-wide meetings and interactions are vital to providing
young scientists with a broad perspective on research outside their own projects, avoiding early
overspecialization and an inappropriately narrow research focus.
Coursework includes a program-specific course on pulmonary disease and research, Perspectives in
Pulmonary Medicine. We will also offer a wide range of courses appropriate to trainees embarking on a
research career. These include experimental design, grant writing, manuscript writing, human investigations,
epidemiological methods, and career development. These are offered in our graduate programs, our OCTRI
Human Investigations Program, and other University departments.
Research mentorship is provided by a faculty of seasoned scientists with extensive experience in training
young scientists. About half the faculty conducts research primarily involving the lung. The remainder have
specific areas of expertise in cell and molecular biology that are frequently applied to the study of lung
diseases. Interactions and synergy among the laboratories in this program add to the rich and broad training
environment. Our trainees have been very successful given the relative youth of our training program, including
achieving independent research funding, faculty or industry positions in biomedical research, and postdoctoral
positions at other prestigious institutions."
10873128,"Abstract
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children, with T-cell ALL accounting for 15% of
cases. T-ALL in children is associated with aggressive clinical features and inferior treatment response to
combination chemotherapy, compared to B-cell ALL. Further intensification of cytotoxic drug-based therapy is
ineffective for relapsed T-ALL and novel agents are much needed for these patients. We recently discovered
that a significant proportion of pediatric T-ALL exhibits exceptional response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib,
in an ABL-independent fashion. Our preliminary genomic analyses pointed to the activation of the preTCR-LCK
signaling pathway as a potential driver of this drug response phenotype. We have developed an innovative
systems biology approach that integrates transcriptional profile with functional ex vivo drug testing in order to
develop a clinically translatable biomarker for sensitivity and resistance to dasatinib in T-ALL. We hypothesize
that our systems biology approach can comprehensively identify molecular determinants of dasatinib response
in T-ALL, and that dasatinib-sensitive T-ALLs have distinct clinical and genomic features.
In this project, we propose to 1) develop a systems biology-based biomarker model of dasatinib sensitivity in T-
ALL; 2) systematically characterize genomics and clinical features associated with dasatinib sensitivity in T-ALL,
and 3) explore mechanism of dasatinib resistance in T-ALL and develop biomarker-driven combination therapy
to overcome drug resistance.
Successful completion of these studies is likely to substantially shift the paradigm of how pediatric T-ALL is
treated and significantly impact the next generation of clinical trials and improve cure rates for children with this
devastating illness."

funding for the UIC Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). Our Program has filled a significant
gap in career development for biomedical research faculty at UIC, championing and creating a new culture of
career mentorship and establishing a vibrant cadre of well-trained and highly successful faculty in clinical and
translational science. Over the past 10 years, the CATS Scholars Program has provided mentorship and career
development for 34 Scholars through both CTSA and institutional support. Our program supports a diverse
group of Scholars who are >60% women, >35% from groups underrepresented in biomedical research, and from
five different health sciences colleges. The overall goal of the CATS Scholars Program is to support the
development of clinical and translational scientists who will engage the community and who will make substantive
research advances that impact patient care. The specific goals of the program are 1) to provide a mentored
career development experience that allows Scholars to develop the NIH/CTSA identified core competencies in
clinical and translational research, 2) to provide Scholars with unique training opportunities that will drive
innovation in research and 3) to systematically evaluate the Program and provide for continuous improvement
and alignment with NIH/CTSA goals of advancing therapeutics, clinical interventions, and behavioral
modifications to improve health. The program is supported by a cadre of more than 40 outstanding mentors who
maintain vibrant and relevant research programs along with a commitment to mentoring. Innovative components
of the program include an institutional commitment to a 3rd year of support for every Scholar, institutional support
for external experiences to enrich Scholar training, extension of program activities to support additional “Affiliate”
Scholars, engagement of former Scholars as mentors and advisors to the program, and a strong interactive
career development program that spans all three Chicago CTSA hubs. Our Scholars benefit greatly from the
core services, educational programs, and capacity of the UIC CCTS, and the utilization of these services has
been instrumental to their growth. The activities of CATS Scholars align with the national CTSA goals of
advancing therapeutics, clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve health, as the Program
Plan includes activities within these themes. The success of our scholars is evidenced by their rapid acquisition
of independent extramural funding and by the continued advancement of Scholars as leaders in clinical and
translational science. The CATS Scholar program, with its inclusive reach, provides a needed and highly valuable
career development resource for clinical and translational science faculty at UIC."
10658140,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT FROM THE PARENT GRANT APPLICATION
Increased moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is associated with reductions in treatment-
related side effects, cancer recurrence and mortality and increased QOL and survival in breast and
endometrial cancer survivors. However, the majority (~70%) of survivors do not meet cancer-specific MVPA
recommendations (i.e. 150 mins/week). MVPA support is not part of standard care, resulting in few survivors
having access to efficacious MVPA programs. Failure to translate MVPA programs into care is a result of most
interventions being intense, on-site programs that deliver multiple components simultaneously to all
participants. This “one-size-fits-all” approach does not account for individual needs, nor can it realistically be
implemented into survivorship care. mHealth tools (i.e. smartphone applications, Fitbits, text messages), are
inexpensive and have demonstrated efficacy for increasing MVPA in other populations. Thus, they may be a
more scalable, less resource-intensive strategy to increase MVPA in more survivors. The ability to integrate
wearable MVPA monitor data into the electronic health record (EHR) further enhances the potential for a
technology-supported MVPA intervention to be integrated into cancer care. However, responses to these tools
is heterogeneous and may vary as part of a gradually progressing (in terms of weekly goal mins) MVPA
program. While a minimal intervention including the Fitbit integrated into the EHR (Fitbit+EHR) may be
sufficient for some cancer survivors to increase their MVPA, others will need more support. Further, some
survivors may need this additional support early on, while others may succeed early, but fail later when the
MVPA goal increases. Evidence is lacking to determine: a) whether the best augmentation tactic for non-
responders is to offer another mHealth component (i.e. online exercise videos) or a more traditional component
(i.e., telephone coaching) and b) when to classify a survivor as a non-responder. Thus, we propose to utilize a
novel experimental approach, the SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) to determine the
optimal: 1) augmentation component(s) to address non-response and 2) time is to identify non-responders.
Breast and endometrial cancer survivors (n=320) will be randomized to early (4 weeks) or delayed (8 weeks)
non-response evaluation groups. Those who do not respond to the Fitbit + EHR intervention as evidenced by
failure to sufficiently increase their MVPA will be re-randomized to one of two subsequent augmentation
tactics, either: (1) online gym or (2) online gym and coaching calls. Responders will continue with the
Fitbti+EHR for 6 months. The project is significant because it aims to develop an effective and scalable MVPA
intervention for cancer survivors that will move from a one-size-fits-all approached to a dynamic, tailored
approach for MVPA promotion by identifying non-responders at the right time and providing them with the
additional intervention components necessary to increase MVPA and improve health and disease outcomes."

Children who survive severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) live with profound impairments that alter their
development and future possibilities. Worldwide, TBI is the leading cause of death and disability among children
and adolescents. In the US, the annual incidence of pediatric TBI is greater than MS, HIV/AIDS, spinal cord
injury, and breast cancer combined1. Although not strictly pediatric diseases, this comparison illustrates the
magnitude and importance of the pediatric global health epidemic we are addressing.
Our primary focus for scientific investigation is to conduct a high quality randomized controlled trial
addressing a critical TBI management question: Does using a protocol with information from intracranial pressure
(ICP) monitoring to direct treatment of children with sTBI improve outcomes vs an aggressive management
protocol based on imaging and clinical examination alone? This follows on our adult ICP study2 which found no
outcome differences and has occasioned re-thinking of treatment guidelines for sTBI patients >13. A separate
study is essential because children are not simply small adults and some treatment approaches carry age-related
additional risks. Thus, study findings will inform US and global clinical practice.
This trial will be conducted in 7 Latin American pediatric ICUs where infrastructures and practice patterns are
optimal for strong internal validity and resources represent trauma care in the developing world. The successful
adolescent/adult BEST TRIP trial, which collected high-quality data in similar environments (cited > 900 times)
underscores the feasibility of this approach.
Specific Aim: In a Phase III randomized superiority trial in 428 children with sTBI from 7 Latin American pediatric
trauma centers, test the effect on outcomes of management of sTBI guided by a protocol using information from
ICP monitors vs. management using a protocol that uses imaging and clinical exams to guide treatment.
Hypothesis #1: Children with severe TBI whose acute care treatment is managed using a protocol based on data
from ICP monitoring will have significantly lower mortality and better quality of life and global outcome at 6 months
post-trauma than those whose treatment is managed with a protocol based on imaging and clinical exam. The
primary measure of functional recovery is the PedsQL at 6 months. A secondary measure is GOSE-Peds.
Hypothesis #2: Incorporating ICP monitoring into sTBI patient care of will minimize secondary complications,
decrease length of stay in ICU and decrease brain-specific treatments.
Specific Aim: We will train personnel in centers new to research in how to conduct high-quality scientific studies,
and will extend the training for the personnel with whom we have been working, solidifying previous capacity-
building efforts, and initiating new efforts."

Interpreting human facial expressions is a core human social capacity negatively impacted in diverse
neuropsychiatric conditions. Failures of human social cognition contribute to disease burden in mood
disorders, as well as autism spectrum and anxiety disorders, reinforcing and exacerbating the social isolation
and hopelessness of patients across diagnostic categories. The proposed study examines the RDoC
subconstruct of “Facial Communication” and the domain of “Negative Valence Systems” using behavioral
cognitive tasks that place heavy demands on the capacity to interpret emotional facial expressions. Prior
efforts to develop neuromodulation paradigms for treatment-resistant cases of neuropsychiatric diseases
characterized by socio-affective dysfunction have fallen short, in part due to an absence of defined neural
dysfunctional-state signals. The overall goal of this R01 proposal is to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of
social affective processing and to examine selective modulation of these dynamics in humans undergoing
invasive intracranial monitoring for treatment-resistant epilepsy and depression. Pursuing this signal from a
novel platform with invasive intracranial recording electrodes provides much-needed spatial and
temporal resolution to characterize the neural dynamics of socio-affective processing. We will leverage
first-in-human intracranial neural recording opportunities created by a novel therapeutic platform termed
“stereotactic electroencephalography-informed deep brain stimulation” (stereo-EEG-informed DBS; Parent
Study UH3-NS103549), as well as the powerful platform of intracranial stereotactic recording and stimulation in
patients undergoing epilepsy surgical evaluation at Baylor College of Medicine. The sEEG-informed DBS trial
provides unique opportunities for intracranial recording of affect-relevant network regions in patients with
treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recordings in identical regions in epilepsy patients who themselves
often demonstrate mild-moderate depressive symptoms will provide a wide dynamic range across the
symptom spectrum. To provide critical data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of socio-affective processing we
will leverage these two human intracranial recording and stimulation cohorts to study the precise structural
(Aim 1), functional (Aim 2), and causal (Aim 3) properties of the affective salience network. Greater
understanding of the social processing circuitry mediated by the affective salience network may be used to
drive therapeutic innovation, pioneering a new paradigm that improves socio-emotional function across a wide
variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. The results from this proposal have the potential to improve the lives of
patients with dysfunction in social affective processing, with implications for a wide range of neuropsychiatric
diseases."
10842317,"The following proposal is built on our recent novel findings showing a critical role for endothelial Piezo1 in cerebral blood
flow (CBF) regulation and brain health. Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel that gates Ca2+ and Na+ influx in response
to membrane stretch or increased shear force. In the peripheral vasculature, endothelial Piezo1 is activated by increased
flow/shear and promotes vasodilation through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. We now provide novel preliminary data
demonstrating that selective loss of endothelial Piezo1 promotes a decrease in resting CBF (hypoperfusion), while
pharmacological activation of endothelial cell (EC) Piezo1 promotes increased CBF (hyperemia). Our data further show
that the consequences of chronic EC Piezo1 loss of function (LOF) include endothelial upregulation of genes associated
with inflammation and microglia/macrophage recruitment (scRNAseq), widespread microgliosis, and development of
white matter injury.
In specific regard to AD/ADRD, beta-amyloid (Ab) peptides (e.g. Ab40, Ab42) have been shown to acutely reduce Piezo1
sensitivity to flow/shear activation. These findings offer the intriguing possibility that conditions of amyloidosis may impair
EC Piezo1-mediated CBF regulation. Our preliminary data support this possibility, as we show progressive impairment of
EC Piezo1-dependent hyperemia in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic TgAPP mice. Additionally, by analyzing public
snRNAseq data from AD and cognitively normal patients, we found a transcriptional signature consistent with reduced
flow- and Piezo1-dependent signaling in EC from brain of AD patients. Together, these data suggest that EC Piezo1 is vital
for normal CBF regulation and that the dysfunction of EC Piezo1 can exacerbate cerebral hypoperfusion and worsen age
and Ab-driven pathology.
In the proposed project, we will define how EC Piezo1 LOF contributes to cerebrovascular pathology in aging and
amyloidosis and explore the novel strategy of EC Piezo1 gain of function (GOF) as an ameliorative solution. Our overall
hypothesis is that EC Piezo1 LOF potentiates aging and Ab-mediated pathology and that EC Piezo1 GOF can restore
cerebrovascular function and provide resilience to aging and Ab-mediated cognitive decline. Aim 1 will define how brain-
specific EC Piezo1 LOF leads to brain pathology in mouse models of aging and amyloidosis. We will use two TgAPP mouse
lines that model different aspects of amyloidosis (Tg2576 and TgSwDI). Aim 2 will leverage the ability to enhance CBF via
EC Piezo1 GOF to restore CBF regulation, provide cerebrovascular resilience, and slow progression of aging and Ab-related
brain pathology and cognitive decline in mouse models of aging and amyloidosis. We will induce Piezo1 GOF selectively in
brain endothelium of young and aged WT mice and in TgAPP mice at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages.
Completion of Aims 1 and 2 will employ a combination of in vivo measures of CBF and cerebrovascular function, measures
of EC Piezo1 channel function, 3D quantitative imaging of white matter tracts, brain and vascular immuno/histochemical
analyses, and behavior studies. All studies will be performed in both sexes. If successful, these studies will establish EC
Piezo1 as a valuable therapeutic target for enhancing brain perfusion and reducing cognitive decline."

10870094,"Project Summary
Although the precise definition of “chemical biology” can be a subject for lively discussion, it is
universally understood to entail the use of small molecules and peptides for greater understanding of
biology. Depending on the goals of its specific practitioners, the specific compounds discovered in the
context of a chemical biology program are most often pharmacological tools for in vitro or in vivo
elucidation of particular pathways. In some cases, however, the development of such “probes”
constitutes the first step toward drug discovery by providing lead compounds for preclinical study. In
either case, the success of a given chemical biology project requires the identification of suitable
molecules for study, the optimization of desired properties at the expense of undesired properties, and
the construction of custom-made probes for additional biological evaluation. Since it is rare that an ideal
probe molecule is sitting in a screening collection just waiting to be discovered, all of the above activities
rely on synthetic medicinal chemistry to optimize initial hits and ultimately provide the molecule around
which a chemical biology program will be based. The Core D, Synthetic Chemical Biology, will enable
researchers to understand and combat infectious disease by providing design and synthesis of peptides
and small molecules that are chemically targeted to the specific biological needs."

10884255,"ABSTRACT
The importance of the enteric (ENS) and autonomic nervous systems (ANS) in maintaining intestinal health is
made evident in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), defined by the absence of the ENS in distal bowel and caused
by a number of mutations (e.g., Ednrb). HSCR is managed with surgery to remove the ‘abnormal’ bowel, but
many patients suffer from persistent functional and inflammatory bowel complications (e.g., Hirschsprung
Associated Enterocolitis, HAEC), indicating that the ENS in proximal bowel is also affected by HSCR-related
mutations despite appearing anatomically normal. Our lab generated a novel HSCR mouse model with Ednrb
mutations that expresses GCaMP, a genetically-encoded calcium indicator, to measure synaptic connectivity in
proximal bowel where the ENS is present. By using in vivo and ex vivo colon preparations that keep intrinsic
and extrinsic nerve pathways intact, we have previously shown how ENS, ANS (sympathetic and
parasympathetic), and sensory inputs normally influence colon function. Ednrb-/- (null)-GCaMP mice had specific
changes in myenteric neuron activity (spontaneous and synaptically-evoked) in proximal colon at post-natal ages
that likely contribute to the chronic issues in HSCR. Interestingly, age-matched Ednrb+/- (het)-GCaMP mice
displayed a similar functional phenotype, despite having ENS innervation in the entire bowel, and they continued
to be significantly different from wild-type littermates as adults. These mice exhibited dysmotility, had altered
immune cell counts in the lamina propria, and appeared to be more vulnerable to experimentally-induced
inflammation. Therefore, ‘subclinical’ mutations in HSCR-related genes (i.e., those that would not cause a HSCR
diagnosis) appear to be sufficient to impair aspects of ENS circuit development. Importantly, Ednrb-/- and Ednrb+/-
GCaMP mice model different aspects of HSCR: ‘clinical’ HSCR complications in newborns and ‘subclinical’
HSCR issues that persist into childhood and adulthood. Several recent HSCR studies have identified shifts in
the microbiome and impaired immunity that may underlie increased inflammation and HAEC, but the causal role
of the microbiome in producing HSCR-related dysfunction is unknown. Based on what is known about neuro-
immune-microbiota interactions, I hypothesize that the ENS/ANS contributes to immune dysfunction indirectly
via microbiome changes due to dysmotility, but also potentially through changes in direct neuro-immune
communication. To test this hypothesis, experiments in Aim 1 (K99) will define the immune cell profile and
microbiome in ‘clinical’ and ‘subclinical’ HSCR mouse models at post-natal ages, and determine whether the
‘HSCR microbiome’ is necessary and/or sufficient to produce ENS, ANS, or immune dysfunction. Experiments
in Aim 2 (R00) will test whether HSCR-related dysfunction in the ENS/ANS impairs the ability to respond to
inflammatory immune challenge, and determine the role of the ‘HSCR microbiome’ in resolving inflammation.
As numerous digestive disorders exhibit neural, microbiome and/or immune dysregulation, the proposed
research program will broadly impact human health."
10909247,"Project Summary/Abstract
Youth who exhibit an evening circadian chronotype (“night-owls”) follow a delayed sleep schedule, increasing
activity later in the day and both going to sleep and getting up later, compared to morning types
(“larks”). Eveningness arises from a confluence of psychosocial, behavioral and biological factors and is an
important contributor to vicious cycles that escalate vulnerability and risk among youth. While the basic
biological shift toward eveningness—initially triggered around the onset of puberty—may be difficult to modify,
the psychosocial and behavioral contributors are modifiable. Supported by R01HD071065, we have conducted
a “treatment experiment” in which we delivered the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention for Youth
(TranS-C) to reduce eveningness among 10-18 year olds. We randomly allocated youth with an evening
chronotype, and who were “at risk” in at least one of five health-relevant domains (emotional, cognitive,
behavioral, social, physical), to either: (a) TranS-C (n = 89) or (b) Psychoeducation (n = 87). While the results
were promising, some drop off in treatment gains were observed. This is consistent with prior research
documenting that a drop-off in the years following treatment is too commonly observed. Indeed, there have
been calls to study if and how behavioral interventions are maintained (NOT-OD-19-040). Hence, in this
revised renewal application, we propose to study the maintenance of behavior change by conducting a 6-year
follow-up of the unique cohort of youth recruited for R01HD071065. The youth will be 16 to 26 years old. They
will be assessed for sleep and circadian functioning and functioning in five health-relevant domains (emotional,
cognitive, behavioral, social, physical) (SA1) and for their utilization of sleep health behavior (SA2). As a next
step in this research program, we propose to evaluate if a Habit-based Sleep Health Intervention
(“HABITs”)—a novel low-cost approach derived by leveraging the science of habit formation—improves the
utilization of sleep health behavior and improves sleep and circadian outcomes and functioning in the five
health-relevant domain outcomes in the short and longer term (SA3). An independent sample of youth who
exhibit a high level of eveningness and are “at risk” in at least one of the five health-relevant domains will be
randomly allocated to HABITs alone or HABITs plus Text Messaging (“HABITs+Texts”) (n = 160). The text
messaging portion is derived from learning theory, the Behavior Change Wheel and focus groups. We will also
examine if sleep health behavior that has become habitual mediates the effects of treatment on improvement
in sleep, circadian and health outcomes. Moderation analyses will examine if intervention effectiveness is
related to age/developmental stage, sex, SES, racial/ethnic minority group and season of participation. This
research will advance knowledge on longer-term outcomes, the role of eveningness as a mechanism
contributing to poorer youth outcome and the value of leveraging of learning theory and the science of habit
formation in health promotion."

The objective of this new Immuno-Engineering Postdoctoral Training (ImEPosT) Program is to train a new
generation of interdisciplinary scientists in the emerging field of immunoengineering, by taking advantage of
the strengths of University of Chicago mentors in identifying the most pressing questions in immunology and
combining that with a growing body of bioengineers who create new tools, technologies, and algorithms to
push the technical boundaries to address those questions. Anchored by a collegial and cohesive body of 36
mentors across the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) and the Biological Sciences Division
(BSD), The ImEPosT program will select the most promising postdoctoral trainees from bioengineering and
immunology backgrounds to participate on a two-year program of collaborative research across the
immunology-bioengineering interface that includes a flexible didactic component to build important skills like
project development and management, grant writing, teaching, science communication, outreach, and career
planning. In the laboratory, the mentors have expertise in six major areas: (A) Allergy, Autoimmunity, &
Transplantation; (B) Vaccines; (C) Immuno-oncology; (D) Cellular & Molecular Immunology; (E) Computational
& Systems Immunology; and (F) Microbiome. These mutually-overlapping areas of expertise have created a
portfolio of collaborative projects. These include improving vaccination outcomes through in silico modeling of
the effects of adjuvants on the immune system; systems approaches to delineate the molecular mechanisms of
communication between commensal microbes with the immune system and the digestive system that lead to
homeostasis versus disease; organotypic devices to model neutrophil swarming and activation during early
inflammatory activation; protein engineering and computational approaches to deliver cytokine receptor
`superagonists' as adjuvants in vaccines or cancer immunotherapies. Ultimately, ongoing projects across the
36 participating PME and BSD laboratories seek to use unconventional approaches to deliver new insights to
gaps in knowledge in immunology, therapies that correct immunologic dysfunction or loss-of-function, and also
diagnostics to identify potential routes of intervention. Led by Profs. Melody A. Swartz and Maria-Luisa Alegre,
with Dr. Shann S. Yu (Scientific Director of the Chicago Immunoengineering Innovation Center) as the program
administrator, the ImEPosT program will build on an outstanding infrastructure for postdoctoral training at
UChicago together with a history of success of its faculty in mentoring prior trainees into successful careers in
academia, government, and industry to create a new program that addresses emerging engineering needs in
the rapidly evolving fields of immunopathology and immunotherapy."

Kinase (NLK) is activated in erythroid progenitors with ribosome-insufficiency, irrespective of the driving
ribosomal mutation. Suppression of NLK improves erythroid expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells (HSPCs) from DBA patients and mouse models in vitro.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the role of NLK in the pathogenesis of DBA and
identify novel upstream regulators and downstream substrates of NLK. Through the acquisition of new skills in
state-of-the-art technologies pioneered by my mentoring team, I foresee the successful resolution of the
proposed research aims and the development of the skillset and preliminary data necessary to establish my
own independent research program. In Aim 1, I will use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out NLK in ribosome-
insufficient donor HSPCs and examine engraftment after transplantation into recipient mice. As NLK is
activated in DBA models irrespective of the driving mutation, this represents a gene therapy approach for
autologous stem cell transplantation with the potential to cure the hematological impacts of the disease. In Aim
2, I will identify and characterize downstream substrates of NLK in DBA. In Aim 3, I will identify and
characterize deregulated proteins upstream of NLK activation in DBA. The last two aims include
characterization of preliminary candidates, complimented by genome wide screens to identify novel factors.
Collectively, these studies have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and improve outcomes for DBA
patients.
 This proposed work will also provide me with the necessary tools and expertise to successfully
transition to an independent career. Bench skills I will acquire include mouse stem cell transplantation,
CRISPR/Cs9-mediated gene therapy of stem cells, ribosome and mitochondrial biogenesis, translational
analysis and genome-wide kinome analysis. Coursework covering bench skills (e.g. RNA biology, applied
computational tools, and bioinformatics) and career development (e.g. mentorship, personnel management
and faculty transitioning) will compliment guidance from my mentoring team. Dr. Sakamoto has an exemplary
track record of producing leaders and is committed to continued guidance as I take on more autonomy. Dr.
Sakamoto and Stanford have demonstrated exceptional commitment to my professional development
throughout my fellowship and instructor training and I have no doubt their continued support towards our
shared goal of developing a world class independent research program dedicated to understanding the
pathogenesis of nonmalignant hematological disorders such as DBA."

Newer therapies directed at the full-length (FL) androgen receptor (AR) C-terminal ligand-binding domain
(LBD) such as abiraterone and enzalutamide provide survival benefits to patients with advanced prostate
cancer. Unfortunately, these therapies are not curative. A major mechanism of resistance to these therapies is
the expression of truncated constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) that lack the LBD. Prostate cancer
patients with metastatic lesions that express AR-Vs should be offered alternative treatments (e.g., taxanes)
instead of inhibitors of FL-AR. Unfortunately, to date there is no technology available that can distinguish which
metastatic lesions express AR-Vs. Circulating tumor cells have many limitations and cannot provide
information about the individual lesions such as whether a specific lesion is responding to therapy while other
lesions may be refractory to the treatment.
The N-terminal domain (NTD) is common to both FL-AR and AR-Vs and is essential for their transcriptional
activities to drive prostate cancer growth. Therefore the intrinsically disordered AR-NTD is a novel therapeutic
target for drug development. We have discovered all of the small molecules such as EPI and sintokamide
(SINT/LPY) that have been proven to directly bind to the AR-NTD and block the transcriptional activities of FL-
AR and AR-Vs. Efficacy of these compounds in preclinical models of castration resistance prostate cancer
(CRPC) led to the clinical development of EPI compounds. EPI-506 showed proof-of-concept in a first-in-
human dose escalation Phase I clinical trial in heavily pre-treated CRPC patients that had failed abiraterone
and/or enzalutamide thereby supporting the approach of targeting the AR-NTD and the EPI scaffold. This was
the first time any drug that directly binds to an intrinsically disordered region reached clinical trials.
Here we assemble leading experts to develop next generation drugs that bind to the intrinsically disordered
AR-NTD as imaging agents and therapeutics for the prognosis and treatment of CRPC. Our short term goal is
to evaluate second generation analogues of EPI-002 (ralaniten) and SINT/LPY that have up to 125-fold better
potency compared to the first generation compounds. This is addressed in Aims 1 and 2 where we will
synthesize novel binders of AR-NTD that have either the EPI or SINT/LYP scaffold and then will characterize
these compounds to select the best candidates for structural analyses (Aim 3), and in Aim 4 for imaging and
efficacy studies. Revealing structural changes will aid in the development of better drugs against this target.
Creation of a molecular imaging agent would potentially provide near-term clinical impact to select patient
treatments based upon expression of AR-Vs in metastatic lesions. Developing drugs that target the AR-NTD to
inhibit both FL-AR and AR-Vs would provide a novel treatment option for these patients."
10893001,"PROGRAM ABSTRACT - Data Science for Child Health Now in Ghana (DS-CHANGE) Training Program
Our goal for the DS-CHANGE Training Program is to build data science capacity at Kwame Nkrumah University
of Science and Technology (KNUST) and develop a cadre of qualified data scientists focused on child health in
Ghana. We will develop this cadre of scientists with mentored training and experiential learning that cross-sect
biomedical data science disciplines (applied mathematics, computer science, clinical informatics,
biostatistics, epidemiology), health conditions (malaria, injury and congenital anomalies), and biomedical
domains (e.g. pediatrics, parasitology). Faculty and graduate student trainees will tackle computationally
complex child health problems in Ghana. Our program focuses on 3 of the top 10 causes of child death/disability
in Ghana including malaria, injury, and congenital malformations (orofacial clefts). We aim to:
Aim 1: Deliver a comprehensive mentored interdisciplinary training program that cross-sects data science
methodologies, health conditions, and biomedical domains to a diverse group of Ghanaian graduate-level
MS and PhD trainees.
Aim 2: Increase KNUST faculty and institutional capacity in biomedical data science by (a) facilitating
cross-training in data science methodologies; (b) developing deeper expertise in biomedical data science
methods; and (c) building teaching and mentoring proficiency in biomedical data science.
Aim 3: Develop proficiency of faculty and graduate trainees in effective methods of team science so that
interdisciplinary teams with minimal overlapping expertise can function synergistically.
Collaboration: This program builds on established collaborations between KNUST and the University of
Washington (UW), Seattle Children's Hospital and Research Institute, and the non-profit Smile Train. Approach:
KNUST graduate trainees will obtain a Master or PhD degree in data science from KNUST that will be bolstered
by a 3 month externship in Seattle with a thesis on a real world Ghana child health problem. KNUST faculty
trainees will participate in faculty exchanges with UW faculty. Select KNUST faculty will complete a UW
Professional Certificate Program in a data science domain. All trainees will participate in a monthly Zoom seminar
to enhance interdisciplinary effectiveness. Impact: We will train 13 graduate trainees and 16 faculty for a robust
biomedical data science graduate program at KNUST. Trainees will compete successfully for research funding,
will contribute to the evidence base in child health, and will take up positions as leaders in data science and child
health at KNUST and other Ghanaian institutions."
10917089,"ABSTRACT: OVERALL CORE
Every year, millions of children in the United States suffer child abuse and neglect (USDHHS, 2022). Our
CAPSTONE Center for Multidisciplinary Research in Child Abuse and Neglect (P50) Project renewal goals are
to advance a national resource center for conducting innovative research, disseminating emerging discoveries,
and training investigators, clinicians, policy makers, and other professionals committed to preventing the
occurrence of, and understanding the sequelae of, child maltreatment. The TRANSFORM renewal
(Translational Research that Adapts New Science FOR Maltreatment Prevention) will continue to build on
current state-of-the-art research methodologies and clinical practices to foster the next generation of
professionals committed to addressing the deleterious and persistent personal and societal burden associated
with child abuse and neglect. TRANSFORM builds upon the strengths of Mt. Hope Family Center, University of
Rochester, and the University of Minnesota, including large longitudinal databases on child maltreatment.
Additionally, a Resource Core incorporating statistical and methodological expertise from Dr. Jungmeen Kim at
Virginia Tech will further strengthen TRANSFORM, extend our geographical reach, and expand our
partnerships. TRANSFORM will continue to influence the field by serving as a national flagship Center on the
etiology and sequelae of child abuse and neglect. We are grounded in the developmental psychopathology
framework and adhere to a life course perspective in our research. TRANSFORM emphasizes a
transdisciplinary approach, integrates contextual and cultural considerations as well as multigenerational
influences to advance science and inform practice and policy. In doing so, TRANSFORM will apply the most
advanced concepts and methods derived from child maltreatment research, and leverage numerous
longstanding relationships within the child welfare community to make its impact. To achieve its objectives,
TRANSFORM will utilize two Research Projects, a pilot study, and three mutually-informative and integrated
Cores: a Dissemination and Outreach Core, a Resource Core, and an Administrative Core. This ‘team science’
model brings together professionals with different backgrounds including: basic and applied scientists who
provide much of the theoretical grounding for project hypotheses, program developers who are the architects
of evidence-based programs, research methodologists who advise on the appropriate experimental designs for
testing the models, measurements for assessing key constructs, and analytical methods for evaluating results,
and child-serving professionals who will participate in dissemination activities. TRANSFORM will be led by Drs.
Sheree Toth and Dante Cicchetti, internationally-recognized leaders in the field of child maltreatment, whose
collaborative work spans over four decades and provides a solid foundation for continuing to conduct
groundbreaking longitudinal, intergenerational, and intervention research that will contribute to widespread
engagement across multiple child-serving systems."
10897845,"ABSTRACT
 Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, are
associated with poor outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In particular, these factors are
associated with worse glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol control, which significantly increases the
risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. They are also key drivers of racial/ethnic and
socioeconomic status-based disparities in diabetes outcomes. Thus, there is a growing call for interventions to
address these needs and improve T2DM outcomes. However little research has assessed whether changes in
health-related social needs are associated with changes in T2DM outcomes.
 This knowledge gap hampers efforts to develop effective interventions. Addressing it will provide much-
needed evidence on which patients to screen for which social needs, and on which interventions targeting
social needs are most likely to improve T2DM outcomes. The pathways linking social needs and T2DM
outcomes are likely characterized by interactions between individual- (e.g., needs, age, gender, race/ethnicity),
clinic- (e.g., clinic characteristics; specifics of the intervention), and area-level factors (e.g., local economic
conditions; community resources). Given this complexity, a multi-pronged approach is needed. We will
combine 3 methods of investigation: 1) longitudinal, multi-level, regression analysis; 2) innovative machine
learning methods to detect novel combinations of factors associated with heterogeneous response to health-
related social needs and health-related social needs interventions while avoiding spurious findings; and 3)
thoughtful qualitative investigation. Such an analysis has never before been possible, because the needed
data elements have not been united.
 This proposal seeks to answer whether improvements in specific health-related social needs are
associated with improvements in specific clinical outcomes, in what circumstances, and which approaches to
addressing health-related social needs, if any, best improve outcomes. We will leverage what we believe to be
the nation’s largest dataset of patient-reported health-related social needs, clinical outcomes, and community-
and clinic-level data. We will examine whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with
changes in hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. Further, we will
evaluate whether clinic-based interventions seem to improve these outcomes, and if there are important
variations in these interventions that are associated with different response to the intervention. The proposed
work will yield important, previously unavailable evidence on how to refine and improve health-related social
need interventions. Specifically, it will help us understand better how better to care for a population at high risk
for T2DM complications. Overall, this project will substantially advance NIDDK’s mission to improve health
equity for vulnerable individuals with T2DM."
10844430,"This is the revision of a second competitive renewal of a currently funded T32 grant that received a very
favorable initial review. This grant provides post-doctoral training in multi-disciplinary multi-modality molecular
and translational cardiovascular imaging for highly qualified fellows holding either a MD or/and PhD, in
preparation for academic careers as independent investigators in the highly clinically relevant field of
cardiovascular imaging and image guided intervention. As imaging technology and molecular medicine
advances, increasingly complex questions often arise requiring the convergence of perspectives from multiple
disciplines. The future of cardiovascular imaging will most likely be practiced by integrated multidisciplinary
teams with diverse areas of expertise. The goal of this research training program is to provide the necessary
skills needed to work in this new multi-disciplinary investigative environment. Applicants will be recruited from
both clinical and basic science departments, with attention paid to recruitment of female, minority, disabled,
and disadvantaged candidates. We will continue to select and enroll applicants to maintain support for 6 post-
doctoral fellows each year, with an equal balance of physicians and scientists. We have added a new pathway
that focuses on image-guided therapy, and have expanded the image analysis pathway to include specific
training in machine and deep learning provided by the recently established Translational Image Analysis and
Machine Learning (TIAML) Center and partnering with data science center at the university. Post-doctoral
fellowship training will be 2-3 years in duration. There will be four primary research focuses in the post-doctoral
training, 1) cardiovascular molecular imaging, 2) cardiovascular imaging technologies and analyses, 3) image
guided therapy, and 4) translational cardiovascular imaging. The primary faculty for this program are from the
Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and from
multiple departments within the Yale School of Medicine, including: Internal Medicine (Section of
Cardiovascular Medicine), Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, and Surgery. The faculty sponsors have been
selected based on extramural support, research productivity, and commitment to multi-disciplinary training.
Each trainee will be assigned a primary preceptor in the basic sciences and engineering or clinical research
and co-mentor with complementary expertise. Trainee progress will be monitored by individual mentors, the
trainee’s advisory committee, and the Program Directors. Drs. Sinusas and Duncan will co-manage the
program to assure a balanced and integrated experience in the relevant clinical and engineering sciences. We
have also established a more formal relationship between our T32 training program and the Vascular Biology
T32 training program within the section of Cardiovascular Medicine and will establish an annual research
retreat with fellow presentations of research in progress. This retreat should help to better integrate basic,
translational and clinical research within the Section of Cardiology and other participating departments."
10890608,"SUMMARY: Post-transcriptional mechanisms control gene expression in virtually every cell. A major
mediator of post-transcriptional gene regulation is the translating ribosome, which comprises three different
types of RNAs: rRNA, tRNA and mRNA. These RNAs, along with ribosomal and mRNA-binding proteins, form
a multi-RNA/multi-protein complex that can markedly influence mRNA stability and translation. Importantly,
this complex is not constitutive. Instead, rRNA-tRNA, rRNA-mRNA, and tRNA-mRNA interactions are highly
regulated, although the mechanisms of its regulation are poorly understood. A potential mechanism may
involve chemical modification of their nucleotides. Indeed, rRNA, tRNA and mRNA are subjected to diverse
chemical modifications whose stoichiometry is highly regulated in different tissues or disease states. Our
underlying hypothesis is that the regulated nucleotide modifications in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA act as a “code”
that controls these RNAs and their mutual interactions, thus encoding unique patterns of gene expression.
Although rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA nucleotide modifications are poised to be critical regulators of gene
expression, studying how these modifications influence each other to control gene expression has been
difficult to explore. In part this reflects the lack of scalable methods to quantify and profile nucleotide
modifications in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Another problem is that understanding the interactions of rRNA,
tRNA, and mRNA requires specialized expertise in each of these three major areas of RNA biology. It is
therefore critical for experts in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA to work together to decipher the mutual interactions of
these RNAs. The Center will bring together a team of experts in these diverse types of RNAs who will work
together to develop novel techniques to probe nucleotide modifications and how they interact to orchestrate
unique patterns of gene expression. The Center will develop novel technologies for mapping and quantifying
rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA modifications, identify the dynamic modification sites in tissues and disease, and
determine the function of these dynamic modifications. The methods and datasets that will be developed in
the Center will provide the foundational knowledge needed to accelerate new areas of epitranscriptomics
research in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA biology. The Center has a major outreach and educational mission. The
outreach/educational opportunities will include sponsored undergraduate research, breakout project funding,
project funding for underrepresented minority trainees, funding for training visiting outside investigators, and
funding for an annual symposium. We will also develop a website that curates the epitranscriptomic mapping
data generated by the Center to ensure rapid and easy access to the new data we generate. Overall, the
Center’s mission is to serve as a hub for training researchers in epitranscriptomics, as well as to develop new
enabling technologies, develop foundational datasets, and reveal fundamental principles of modified nucleotide
function in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA that are needed to open up new areas of epitranscriptomics research."
10761802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cholera is presently caused by O1 serogroup, El Tor biotype V. cholerae, which emerged in 1961 to initiate the
ongoing seventh pandemic. The prior 6 cholera pandemics were caused by O1 serogroup classical biotype V.
cholerae. Over the past 60 years, classical biotype has essentially disappeared from the aquatic environment
and as a cause of cholera. However, the reasons for this are unknown. V. cholerae in the environment is found
in association with numerous vertebrate fish species. The proposed work will use a zebrafish model for V.
cholerae that can investigate interactions between V. cholerae and natural aquatic hosts covering the entire
infectious cycle. Previous work found dramatic differences in the timeline of zebrafish colonization by classical
and El Tor biotypes, with classical being cleared within 72 h and El Tor able to colonize for up to 14 days with
high levels of bacterial replication. We hypothesize that this prolonged fish colonization and replication provided
a strong selective advantage to El Tor, allowing it to replace classical in environmental niches. V. cholerae El
Tor biotype has 2 pathogenicity islands termed VSP-1 and VSP-2 that classical lacks. Data from preliminary
experiments indicate an El Tor strain deleted for VSP-1 has a normal fish colonization phenotype, whereas a
strain deleted for VSP-2 is defective in prolonged colonization. Therefore, it is likely that gene(s) within VSP-2
are essential for prolonged colonization. Aim 1 of this proposal will use a progressive deletion strategy to identify
and characterize gene(s) within VSP-2 that are important for prolonged colonization and assess whether such
genes are sufficient to prolong classical colonization. On the host side, innate and adaptive immunity provide
protection from invading pathogens. Fish have innate immune responses very similar to mammals, as well as
adaptive immune responses that develop over the first 4-6 weeks of life. We hypothesize that classical biotype
is rapidly cleared by a strictly innate response, whereas El Tor can only be cleared by an adaptive immune
response. Aim 2-1 of this proposal will test these hypotheses using larval zebrafish, which have a fully functioning
innate response but an undeveloped adaptive response. Aim 2-2 will further test the hypothesis that El Tor
clearance requires adaptive immunity by using zebrafish mutants that are defective in adaptive immunity.
Completion of the proposed work, using zebrafish as an environmental V. cholerae host model, will significantly
advance our understanding of V. cholerae evolution and selective pressures in a natural reservoir. The long term
goal of this work is to better understand the V. cholerae life cycle, how it contributes to pathogenesis in humans,
and identify new strategies to combat V. cholerae disease and transmission.

 This proposal describes a mentored training and research plan that will facilitate the development of Elie
Abu Jawdeh, M.D., Ph.D., to an independent clinical and translational investigator in neonatal respiratory control
and intermittent hypoxemia (IH). Dr. Abu Jawdeh will complement his current background as a neonatologist
and a clinical scientist to attain new knowledge in basic science methods and biomarker science. The goal of
learning basic science techniques and methods is imperative for Dr. Abu Jawdeh to make the leap into
understanding mechanisms of injury from IH and develop treatments in the future. He will achieve these goals
through structured mentorship, rigorous hands-on laboratory experiences, formal classwork, and skills training.
A team of mentors with an established track record in clinical, translational, and basic sciences will oversee Dr.
Abu Jawdeh’s development and progress to research independence.
 Despite significant progress in neonatal intensive care, preterm infants continue to suffer from significant
morbidities and neurodevelopmental impairment. The societal cost of prematurity is approximately 26 billion
dollars with the cost of care for an extremely preterm infant being 20 times that of a late preterm infant. Major
consequences of prematurity are apnea and lung disease that lead to repeated occurrences of IH; episodic drops
in blood oxygen saturation. These IH episodes, occurring up to hundreds of events/day, have a cumulative effect
on neonatal outcomes. While the evidence linking IH to impairments is mounting, the degree of IH associated
with injury and pathophysiological mechanisms for IH’s contribution to injury remain unclear. This knowledge
gap in the mechanistic understanding of IH creates a critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes. Our goal for
this proposal is to better understand mechanisms and biomarkers of injury from IH in order to discover and titrate
treatments in the future. Through both a prospective clinical cohort of preterm infants and in vitro cell culture
experiments, we will first test the hypothesis that IH increases systemic circulating ligands (bio-mediators) that
injure brain cells using in vitro cell culture system of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Identifying bio-
mediators and pathways of cell death and injury from IH will help develop treatments that we will also explore in
vitro. Then, we will investigate a promising biomarker Neurofilament-L (NfL) for IH-related brain injury and
predictor of early neurological outcome. Identifying biomarkers of injury will allow prognostication of neonatal
outcomes and monitoring of IH treatment effectiveness and titration in the future. We have pilot data to support
both our Aims and hypotheses. This will be the first time such studies and mechanisms are investigated in
preterm infants with IH."
10642089,"Background: PTSD is the most common mental health disorder among Veterans seeking treatment at Veterans
Affairs (VA) hospitals, and more than half of Veterans with PTSD also meet criteria for a substance use disorder
(SUD). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend trauma-focused integrated treatment as a first-line
treatment for Veterans with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. However, whereas most VA providers desire training in
trauma-focused integrated treatment, most are untrained and therefore cannot adequately meet the needs of
these Veterans. To address this critical need, we developed Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use
Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE), an evidence-based, integrated, trauma-focused treatment that
VA has identified as a gold standard of behavioral healthcare. Randomized controlled trials among Veterans
demonstrate COPE’s efficacy in reducing PTSD and substance use. Most Veterans with PTSD/SUD prefer
integrated treatment. Significance/Impact: There is a critical shortage of clinicians trained to deliver COPE.
Traditional in-person workshops are inefficient and costly. A poll of VA PTSD/SUD Specialists found that 96.9%
want COPE training and 99.1% would use a web-based training for COPE if available. A web-based resource
for providers is ideal, as it can be rapidly disseminated, is easily accessible, and provides a significant amount
of standardized information. The proposed project, conducted in close partnership and with funding
provided by the National Center for PTSD, will directly address this critical gap in provider training to improve
the care of Veterans with comorbid PTSD/SUD, enhance treatment delivery using innovative in-session
provider assistance tools, and enhance knowledge of cost-benefit of technology-enhanced training. The new
training program (COPEWeb) may be particularly useful for providers in rural clinic settings where mental health
training is less accessible. This proposal has the potential for high military relevance and an immediate impact
on dissemination and uptake of COPE, as well as a long-term impact on the overall health of the millions of
Veterans suffering from co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Innovation: A new web-based provider training for COPE will
be developed along with a highly innovative delivery aid system to guide clinicians during sessions to
enhance delivery and fidelity to the protocol and reduce provider burden. A panel of national VA experts
and dissemination leaders will develop a best practice VA dissemination guideline on disseminating web-
based provider trainings. The proposed project has the potential to significantly enhance provider training and
increase patient access to evidence-based care. Furthermore, COPEWeb has the potential to serve a novel role
in disaster planning to ensure mental health care providers are equipped to address the anticipated post-
pandemic needs of Veterans given the rise in post-traumatic stress and alcohol/drug use during the pandemic.
Specific Aims: This project will (1) develop a new web-based training protocol and innovative delivery aid system
to strengthen providers’ delivery of COPE to treat Veterans with PTSD/SUD with a high level of fidelity and
competence, and (2) compare the COPEWeb training to in-person training on knowledge, satisfaction, and
behavior (i.e., fidelity). A cost-effectiveness analysis will compare web-based to in-person training.
Methodology: The proposed methods and timeline to develop COPEWeb are based on our team’s prior success
developing other widely-used provider training protocols (e.g., PEWeb, CBTIWeb). COPEWeb will be built and
refined over the course of three strategic phases: content development, alpha-testing, and beta-testing.
Following beta testing, we will compare COPEWeb to in-person training among clinicians. Ongoing assessment
will obtain qualitative and quantitative data on measures of provider satisfaction, knowledge, and behavior.
Implementation/Next Steps: In collaboration with our operations partners, VA leadership, and EBP Coordinators,
COPEWeb will be rapidly disseminated to mental health providers to increase adoption of evidence-based
treatment for PTSD/SUD and improve the quality of mental health care for Veterans and the nation."
10830476,"Project Summary
Privacy-preserving distributed analysis has gained increasing interests in the broad biomedical research
community in recent years, as it can a) eliminate the need to create, maintain, and secure access to central
data repositories, b) minimize the need to disclose protected health information outside the data-owning entity,
and c) mitigate many security, proprietary, privacy and other concerns. As such, it offers great promises in
lowering regulatory and other hurdles for collaboration across multiple institutions and enhancing the public
trust in biomedical research. Equally important, analysis of health data from multiple institutions across the US
would yield more robust and generalizable findings. This is particularly relevant in cancer disparities research
as the sample size for minority groups can be very small from one institution. However, there remain significant
methodological gaps in the current state-of-the-art for privacy-preserving distributed analysis. Most notably,
missing data present significant challenges, as they are ubiquitous in biomedical data including, but not limited
to, electronic health records (EHR). It is well known that missing data is a major source of bias in EHR. For
example, patients from minority groups and those who have less access to private insurance tend to have
more missing data in their EHR. Biased data as a result of missing data are known to yield unfair statistical and
machine learning models, which in turn can perpetuate and exacerbate health inequities and disparities. There
has been no work on principled approaches for properly handling missing data in distributed analysis beyond
our recent works. In addition, it is well-known that distributed analysis is still at risk of revealing important
individual-level information and lacks rigorous guarantee in the sense of differential privacy, the prevailing
notion and metric for privacy protection. To address these significant limitations, we propose three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will refine and develop state-of-the-art imputation methods for handling missing data in
distributed analysis and develop advanced functionalities for enhanced privacy protection through differential
privacy control and homomorphic encryption. Building on the methods developed in Aim 1, we will develop an
open-source and open-access distributed analysis platform that includes a robust system architecture and
user-friendly GUI in Aim 2. We will assess and validate our distributed analysis platform using real-world use
cases in cancer disparities research in Aim 3. With the enhanced privacy protection, our proposed distributed
analysis platform will have the potential to further enhance public trust and lowerhurdles for collaboration
across
multiple
institutions
in cancer research. As such, our platform will enable researchers to use more
information and less biased data in cancer research, enhance the validity, robustness and generalizability of
research findings, and offer
research
substantial benefits in areas including, but not limited to, cancer disparities
and informatics practice."
10791850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children who enter school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically. Yet, low-income children
often enter school behind their more affluent peers. The growing population of Latino children experience
economic and cultural barriers to school readiness (SR). The primary care clinic represents an opportunity to
augment the fractured early childhood education (ECE) system, as pediatricians have trusted, repeated
relationships with children and families. In prior work Latino families of recent kindergarteners identified specific
interventions that could be adapted to their needs in the pediatric clinic including increased knowledge through
skills checklists and text messages, connection to preschool through automatic referrals and parent
empowerment through coaching with parent-child dyads.
My long-term goal is to be an independent physician-scientist and leader in development and implementation
of SR supports for Latino children. This K08 grant will provide mentorship and skill development in learning
health systems to become a school readiness expert and prepare for an early career award. My career
development plan includes specific training goals: 1) expertise in mobile health interventions, 2) advanced
implementation science, 3) clinical trial design for multi-component interventions, and 4) history and
educational culture of immigrant Latinos in the US.
The research objective of this K08 Career Development Proposal is to refine and pilot test a package of parent
preferred pediatric clinic-based SR interventions that specifically target the SR needs and desires of Latino
families. The study premise is that the pediatric clinic is a trusted, acceptable and feasible setting to identify
and address SR needs. Specific Aims: (1) qualitatively determine acceptability, perceived benefits and
implementation for a package of primary-care based SR interventions through interviews with pediatric
providers and early childhood educators (ECE) (n=20), (2) engage a stakeholder panel to prioritize usable and
acceptable SR interventions, create a SR program for the clinical setting, and develop an implementation
strategy for pilot testing and 3) pilot the SR intervention program with parents of Spanish speaking first-born 2-
3-year-olds to determine feasibility and acceptability in the primary care clinic (n=50)."
10818510,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent “forever chemicals” that contaminate water and food
and are detectable in almost every individual in the US. Despite a manufacturer’s voluntary phase-out, efforts
to limit production have been incomplete, and there is no US federal legislation to regulate PFAS, in part due to
a lack of longitudinal data on policy-relevant health outcomes. In particular, high-quality data are limited from
studies among older adults, a population rapidly expanding, and in which altered metabolism, decreased
clearance, and hormonal changes may heighten PFAS vulnerability. In our highly productive first funding cycle,
we reported associations of higher plasma PFAS with greater insulin resistance, cholesterol, abdominal
adiposity, and diabetes risk in midlife. These intermediates presage poorer health in older age, including low
muscle mass and strength, low bone mass, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this competing renewal R01,
we propose to expand our prior work to test our hypothesis that higher and more prolonged exposure to PFAS
increases risk for poor musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health in older adults. In addition, we will test a
secondary hypothesis that builds on our first funding cycle finding that randomization to an exercise and dietary
lifestyle intervention mitigated the effect of PFAS on cardiometabolic risk. We hypothesize that we can identify
specific lifestyle factors (e.g., healthier, anti-inflammatory diet higher in omega-3 fatty acids and lower in fat)
that will attenuate health effects of PFAS, information important for the growing number of communities
identified with high PFAS levels due to contamination and industrial use. We will again leverage the
unparalleled resources of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes
Study (DPPOS), a long-term cohort study nested within a randomized trial. We will leverage the PFAS results
from our first funding cycle, perform additional assays to address new hypotheses and increase sample size
(n=~1400), and benefit from the study’s wealth of high quality, longitudinal data on covariates, CVD, and aging-
relevant outcomes carefully collected over 20 years during critical windows of aging. In Aim 1, we will examine
prospective associations of PFAS with muscle strength (e.g., hand grip) and DXA measures of muscle and
bone mass. In Aim 2, we will examine prospective associations of PFAS with incident adjudicated CVD events.
In Aim 3, a secondary aim, we will examine effect modification of PFAS-outcome associations by study arm
and specific lifestyle factors. By examining longitudinal PFAS exposure across midlife and older age and by
employing sophisticated statistical methods to examine individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures, we will overcome
limitations of the few existing studies of PFAS, musculoskeletal health, and CVD. Our findings will inform PFAS
legislation and health guidance for exposed individuals, with implications for musculoskeletal health and

phase of cognitive loss, the significance of identifying midlife risk factors of late-life cognitive resilience may
lead to better preventive strategies in the general population. The higher prevalence and incidence of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the minority populations, especially African Americans, makes studying resilience
in this population of high public health significance. Three areas of focus – neuroimaging biomarkers, cognitive
tests, and CVD risk factors in midlife will provide a better understanding of midlife factors that may be related to
late-life cognitive resilience. We aim to enroll 750 offspring whose parents were participants in the CHAP
biracial population study with the following primary objective – to test if higher parental cognitive resilience is
associated with less MRI evidence of white matter, hippocampal, and cortical gray matter injury in the
offspring, and to test if these associations are different by race/ethnicity and gender groups. One of the aims of
the study is to identify the contributions of putative risk and protective factors over life span on cognitive
resilience in the 10,342 participants in the parent CHAP study. No new data will be collected in the Parent
Cohort. The second and third aims are to examine the relation of MRI neuroimaging biomarkers with cognitive
tests and carotid femoral pulse wave velocity and systolic BP in the offspring cohort, and examine if these
relationships are stronger among offspring whose parents have higher cognitive resilience, by race/ethnicity,
gender, and by the APOE E4 allele. Such an intergenerational approach to cognitive resilience in a biracial
population sample to study cognitive resilience is novel and provides a unique opportunity to improve our
understanding of cognitive resilience across generations of Americans. This study also has the potential to
make a large public health impact in potentially identifying early, mid, and late life factors of cognitive resilience
leading to better preventive strategies in midlife."
10832093,"Project Summary: Pluripotent stem cell biology and regenerative medicine are rapidly growing fields with
enormous biomedical implications across the entire spectrum of NIH’s clinical, translational, biomedical and
behavioral portfolios. This R25 application seeks five years of sponsorship for our advanced training course
entitled: Frontiers in Stem Cells and Regeneration (FrSCR) held annually at the MBL in Woods Hole under the
Co-Directorship of Drs. Jennifer Morgan (MBL) and Ina Dobrinski (University of Calgary). FrSCR has been
funded for the past five years as a new R25 award, and prior to that under U13 and T15 mechanisms. FrSCR
continues to build on its demonstrated strengths and successes, and continues to expand to incorporate
emerging, important biomedical concepts and sophisticated technological breakthroughs in regeneration and
pluripotency.
 The FrSCR course introduces participating trainees to state-of-the-art research in the fields of
pluripotent stem cell (PSC) biology and regenerative medicine, including biology and applications of
multipotent adult stem cells (ASC). We provide trainees the necessary knowledge of laboratory techniques,
career mentoring and instruction in the ethical, legal, and societal impact (ELSI) of PSC research to greatly
enhance their successful entry into this field. In order to achieve this goal, we propose the following specific
aims: 1) to provide in-depth instruction on the fundamental concepts in stem cell biology and regeneration; 2)
to provide hands-on laboratory training in cutting-edge methods for experimentation with stem cells and
regeneration; 3) to educate trainees on the open questions in the field, and how stem cells and regenerative
biology can be used to solve problems related to human developmental, reproductive, aging, and neurological
disorders, among others; 4) to provide opportunities for career planning and advancement, and to educate
trainees on the legal, ethical, and regulatory landscape in which regenerative medicine research occurs, and
5) to foster a diverse, collegial environment, and to provide students with networking opportunities that lead to
long-term interactions, mentorship, and collaborations.
 FrSCR is a dynamic and evolving entity that each year offers a fresh series of daily lectures on
emerging concepts, followed by extended discussions, laboratory research, technologically intense workshops
and informal seminars over a week-long period. The course is directed towards established investigators as
well as advanced fellows and newly independent scientists who are committed to fundamental, translational or
clinical research studies. The course addresses major current problems, followed by critical discussions and
laboratory experiments in which advanced new techniques are presented to explore these problems. Thus, this
course will provide a significant benefit to biomedical research through the training of new investigators in the
field of stem cell biology and regeneration."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a common and serious health condition. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened
AUD trajectories and heightened barriers to accessing treatment and peer support that are effective in
improving AUD outcomes. A growing number of people are seeking AUD recovery support via popular Online
AUD Recovery Support (OARS) forums on social media platforms. OARS forums lower barriers to social
support in recovery, are widely available, and show promise for improving AUD outcomes. However, as there
are no rigorous clinical trials focusing on OARS forum participation, there is insufficient evidence to
recommend them as effective in supporting AUD recovery. Such trials are challenging, given the variety of
OARS forums and the myriad approaches to participation (e.g., frequency of use, support sought or given). My
long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and leader in development, implementation,
and assessment of behavioral approaches to OARS that are effective in improving AUD recovery outcomes.
To fill crucial gaps in my expertise, I have four training objectives: (1) Conceptual frameworks of AUD and AUD
recovery processes, to provide strong conceptual foundations for this work; (2) Training in focus group
methods for concept mapping and human-centered design, to collect data from OARS forum users that informs
subsequent self-report scale and intervention development; (3) Training in advanced methods for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) text classification, to advance rigorous observational research of OARS behaviors
in naturalistic settings; and (4) Training in clinical trial design for behavioral interventions, to develop and
conduct trials that assess the effectiveness of OARS participation on AUD outcomes. I have assembled a
multidisciplinary mentoring team of AUD and addiction recovery researchers with a strong track record of
NIAAA funding and mentorship. My consultants provide necessary expertise in social processes of recovery,
psychometrics, advanced methods in NLP, and clinical trial development and statistical analysis.
The proposed K01 research builds upon my prior work focusing on patterns of OARS participation and social
support. I propose an OARS Behavioral Pathway Model (OARS-BPM) to characterize observable behavior of
OARS participation and social support, which are associated with development of AUD coping skills and a
recovery-oriented social identity. I will develop self-report scales and corresponding NLP text classifiers to
identify latent constructs of OARS behavior. To assess and refine OARS-BPM, I will elicit focus group feedback
from OARS users and apply NLP text classifiers to characterize user behavior from public OARS forums. Based
on these findings, I will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of an
OARS-BPM based intervention to encourage structured OARS participation over 3 months. Thus, I will develop
necessary self-report and NLP-based measurement tools as well as a behavioral clinical trial framework, which
will potentiate the first randomized controlled trials of OARS participation on improving AUD outcomes."

The increased availability of ultra-high field scanners provides an opportunity to perform fMRI at sub-millimeter
spatial scales and enables in vivo probing of laminar function in the human brain. Investigations at this new
mesoscopic spatial scale in neuroscience not only advance our understanding of the cortical micro-circuitry in
vivo in health and disease, but also help bridge the gap between macroscopic (e.g., conventional fMRI, behavior)
and microscopic (e.g., extracellular recordings) measures of brain function. However, despite promising
potentials, critical barriers remain in achieving adequate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, coverage at this scale.
Until recently, most layer-fMRI studies have been confined to one of the primary cortices using a task design
with a small brain coverage together with macro-vascular-contaminated sequence contrasts for functional
measurement and defining cortical layers roughly based on distortion mis-matched anatomical reference.
 In this project proposal, we will develop a whole-brain layer-specific imaging sequence tool in humans, for
achieving fMRI at high resolution (£800 µm isotropic), high specificity (not being spatially biased with unspecific
vein signals as in BOLD), high sensitivity (robust measurement at layer-level resolution), high spatial accuracy
(layer fMRI analysis in native fMRI space to avoid blurring and errors arising from registration), whole brain
coverage, and eventually extending layer fMRI to more flexible connectivity-based experiment designs. We will
adapt two sequence methods, one is an integrated blood volume and perfusion (VAPER) contrast method to
improve layer fMRI specificity, and the other is a magnetization transfer (MT) weighted anatomical EPI imaging
technique to facilitate determination of cortical depth in native fMRI space. We will improve the pulse design of
the VAPER/MT preparation and incorporate them with a skipped-CAIPI 3D-EPI (segmented acquisition with
CAIPIRINHA sampling) acquisition, as a new method we will call VAPER/MT-3D-EPI. We will develop the
sequence and optimize its design for a whole-brain 0.8-mm isotropic imaging, and demonstrate its sensitivity
and specificity through measuring layer-dependent activity. We will use this new sequence to collect a whole-
brain submillimeter functional image dataset in humans at both resting state and during movie-watching,
establish the layer-specific functional connectivity analysis pipeline, and investigate the involvement of different
cortical layers in the maintenance of the brain networks. We will publicly share the data and analysis code to
facilitate development of layer fMRI methods and demonstrate VAPER/MT-3D-EPI as a user-friendly layer fMRI
tool for network neuroscience."

mouse model systems, to build expertise in the fly model system. My Plan for Career Development is focused
on three needed training areas: 1) use of the fly model system and modern molecular biology techniques to
establish research independence; 2) further clinical expertise in genetics of circadian/sleep disorders; and 3)

between genetic epilepsies, circadian rhythms, and sleep using cross-species approaches.
Environment and Mentorship: My training plan leverages the opportunities available at Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP) and University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). CHOP and UPenn host a large neuroscience
community with state-of-the-art resources and facilities. UPenn is home to the Chronobiology and Sleep

scientists who run independent R01-funded research programs. My co-mentor, Eric Marsh, MD, PhD, is a
successful neurogeneticist and epileptologist who will oversee my continued clinical development.
Research Proposal: The goal of this research proposal is to understand what regulates the timing of seizures.
Emerging data are demonstrating that seizure occurrence is not random; seizures actually occur in daily
cycles. What controls these cycles in seizure risk in people with epilepsy is unknown. Therefore, the goal of
this proposal is to use the gold standard for studying biological rhythms, the fruit fly, to identify novel
mechanisms that regulate seizure rhythmicity. A basic understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms
that control seizure timing may reveal novel pathways for therapeutic intervention and improve our ability to
predict seizures. The best appreciated cyclic endogenous biological cues that may be regulating daily seizure
timing are (1) circadian rhythms and (2) the sleep/wake state. Because the distinct cellular circuitry of circadian
rhythms and sleep/wake state are well characterized in flies, I will apply this knowledge to identify the
mechanisms that underlie time-of-day fluctuations in seizures. I will test if central clock neurons in the brain,
the master regulator of circadian rhythms, controls seizure risk (Aim 1), and/or if circuits involved in sleep/wake
behavior control seizure risk (Aim 2). By using the power of the fly model system, I will provide novel
mechanistic insight as to what regulates the daily timing of seizures."

 During mammalian development, a single cell gives rise to thousands of diverse and functionally
distinct cell-types. Understanding how each cell-type is determined during development is one of the central
questions in biology with far-reaching consequences for human health and regenerative medicine. While much
of our current understanding of how cell-fate decisions are made is based on either temporally-resolved and
non-destructive methods (e.g., time-lapse microscopy) or high-throughput but destructive genomic assays
(e.g., single-cell RNA-seq), a new method that allows continual observation of each cell throughout the
developmental process will fill the major gaps existing in our understanding of cell-fate transitions during
mammalian development.
 Here we propose to develop molecular recording methods that enable the concurrent, non-destructive,
high-throughput measurements of past cellular events and the current cell-type. Our recent methods, DNA
Typewriter and ENGRAM, use precision genome editing to record cell lineage information and key
transcriptional signaling events to the cell’s genome, which are recovered along with the transcriptome at the
single-cell level. During the mentored K99 phase, I will further improve our methods by increasing the lineage
recording efficiency (Aim 1) and testing it in the synthetic mammalian embryo systems (Aim 2). After I
transition to independence in the R00 phase, I will expand the molecular recorder platform to concurrently
capture diverse key cellular events (Aim 3). As our preliminary data on DNA Typewriter and ENGRAM
demonstrate, we are in a strong position to carry out described molecular recording in model development
systems. We anticipate that molecular recording of lineage and key signaling events in the synthetic embryo
systems will deepen our model of early mammalian development. Together, our proposal will serve as a strong
foundation as I transition into my independence and continue developing a general molecular recording
platform."
10904748,"The overarching goal of the Research Administration and Mentoring Core (RAMC) is to guide the development 
of an independent, nationally visible Institute for Biomolecular Targeting (bioMT) at Dartmouth, by fostering 
continued growth, mentoring junior faculty, further intensifying connectivity, and enhancing its scientific impact. 
During phase 1, the RAMC has led the creation of an integrated and successful environment for research, 
education, and professional development. In phase 2, it will strengthen the critical mass of the center and lay the 
foundation for a transition to long-term sustainability. bioMT will fund four Research Projects, two Scientific 
Cores, provide supplemental start-up resources for five tenure-track faculty hires, and initiate a formal pilot 
program in support of research at the basic:translational interface in cancer, airway infection and other complex 
diseases. We will extend and refine our proven faculty mentoring program and will continue to forge a sense of 
scientific community built around interdisciplinary, curiosity-driven exchanges. By identifying and nurturing 
symbiotic connections between basic science investigations and translational research questions, these 
components will advance the identification and validation of biomolecular targets to address compelling public 
health needs. Scientific leadership will be provided by Director Dean Madden, PhD, Associate Director Deborah 
Hogan, PhD, an Internal Advisory Committee, an External Advisory Committee, a Core Advisory Committee, 
and an inclusive Faculty Council. The RAMC will provide efficient scientific leadership, fiscal oversight, and 
organizational support for all bioMT components. Building on strategies successfully deployed in phase 1, it will 
achieve the following Specific Aims: (1) To provide outstanding scientific leadership as bioMT members explore 
new high-impact research directions; (2) To enhance career development through mentoring and educational 
outreach; (3) To facilitate robust scientific communication; (4) To offer efficient administrative and fiscal support 
and evaluation, providing timely and accurate reporting to bioMT and institutional leadership and IDeA Program 
staff; and (5) To enrich the scientific and research environment using institutional resources. Each of these aims 
will advance the bioMT mission. Inclusive, experienced leadership will expand opportunities for bioMT faculty to 
pursue biomolecular target identification, validation, and development. The mentoring program will provide 
expert guidance to the Project Leaders, accelerating their success as independently funded investigators. A 
weekly internal seminar series, interspersed with invited talks and the yearly regional Life Sciences Symposium, 
will catalyze interactions within a highly integrated scientific community. Our resources will recruit additional 
faculty to the Institute, elevate their research, and increase their extramural funding success. Program leadership 
has a strong track record of scientific collaboration and over a decade’s experience with multi-project awards. 
Drawing on that experience, the RAMC will continue to offer excellent organizational support to the investigators 
of bioMT and to advancing its success as a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence at Dartmouth."
10904750,"The goal of the Molecular Tools Core (MTC) is to provide biomolecular tools to the bioMT faculty to allow them
to better achieve their research goals. During the first funding period the MTC assisted over 200 researchers
within the greater biomedical community and played a central role in the advancement of the bioMT junior
research project leaders (RPL) to externally funded independent investigators. Our success is based on the
centralization of the equipment and expertise for providing high-quality purified proteins and other biomolecular
tools, dedicated laboratory work by our expert staff, as well as training of users in the utilization of state-of-the-
art instrumentation maintained within the core. To complement the expertise of our faculty Director, we recruited
a highly experienced Lead Scientist to oversee the operation of the MTC and to provide expert protein
biochemistry support and consultation. Her experience in protein production has served her well particularly as
a consultant, providing advice from sequence analysis to expression systems to purification protocols to both
experienced and novice users. We have established efficient pipelines for protein production in E. coli and
mammalian cells and optimized purification schemes. In collaboration with the Molecular Interactions and
Imaging Core (MIIC), we have developed protocols for biochemical and biophysical characterization and QA/QC
of the final products. Additionally, during phase 1, the MTC created a bioMT Service Center for chargeback
costs of supplies, media and reagents related to eukaryotic cell protein production starting October 1, 2020. In
the next funding period, we will continue to provide valuable resources to all four RPLs as detailed in Aim 1.
One vital feature will be the addition of standard methods for protein production using insect cell lines (Sf9, Hi5).
Aim 2 is to enhance the efficient operation of the core, streamlining the day-to-day operations and overall
throughput to better serve the research community. We will build on our collection of resources, including strains,
vectors, in-house produced enzymes and resins. As part of our phase II strategy, we will expand our throughput
capabilities with respect with construct design, cloning, expression screenings to rapidly identify protein targets,
reducing the burden of the bioMT investigators on protein production. As the number of users of the MTC has
expanded, it is imperative that we invest in the efficiency of the operation of the core and maintain a robust user
base as we transition to a cost-share center to guarantee sustainability. Another key element of our phase II
strategy is sustainability. As outlined in Aim 3, we will develop cost-recovery models. Faculty will not be charged
during phase II, but we will share quarterly usage with projected costs, so they can include costs in grant
submissions prior to phase III. Looking towards the future, the MTC will also support collaborative pilot projects
designed to nucleate multi-project grants. Overall, the phase II plan for MTC will continue to catalyze the success
of RPLs and other bioMT faculty, drawing our faculty together and laying the foundation for the Institute’s long-
term transition to COBRE independence."

In phase I of this grant, MIIC has centralized oversight of existing resources and participated in the acquisition
of new equipment, both within the bioMT facility and in conjunction with two existing microscopy cores at
Dartmouth. We have hired staff to provide training, guidance, and experimental support in the characterization
of molecular interactions. We have also hired two imaging navigators to help investigators with experimental
design, image acquisition, and image analysis. These activities significantly enhanced the ability of our phase I
research project leaders (RPLs) and all bioMT investigators to conduct quantitative binding and imaging studies
at Dartmouth, and thus contributed to their extramural and academic success. Our plans for the next funding
period have been guided by an inclusive and intensive program review process. In phase II, MIIC has four
specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to provide customized support to help the four RPLs attain their research goals
and achieve independence. As active participants in the development of the four research projects, the director
and research navigators engaged with the RPLs to comprehensively assess the methods required by each.
From this survey we identified key technologies to quantify binding interactions, to visualize molecular locations
and dynamics of proteins and organelles in cells, and to assess distribution of cells within tumors in situ. Specific
Aim 2 is to expand our services to three key areas: mass spectrometry/proteomics, higher resolution cellular
imaging by super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy analysis of
macromolecular structure. In all three areas, MIIC will continue the cost-effective practice of leveraging existing
equipment at Dartmouth and elsewhere to accomplish these goals. Specific Aim 3 is to extend support for image
analysis, which is an increasingly pressing need for many investigators. Specific Aim 4 prepares for sustainability
of the Core in phase 3. The MIIC works closely with the Molecular Tools Core, which is housed in the same,
newly renovated bioMT Core Facilities Suite. In addition, the MIIC has established strong working relationships
with existing cores at Dartmouth (including several supported by other COBRE awards) as well as at other IDeA
partner institutions. Within all four aims, the MIIC has been designed to adapt flexibly to technological needs
that emerge as bioMT investigators make scientific progress. The MIIC will also share best practices and ensure
up-to-date training for all bioMT investigators interested in monitoring, and in most cases quantifying, binding
interactions of their biomolecules, whether as purified components or within cells. It will thus directly support all
four bioMT Research Projects as well as affiliated bioMT faculty, and will enhance the research infrastructure

The goals of the Program Project are to understand the causes and consequences of cellular senescence as a
driver of age-related neurodegeneration, determine new targets and mechanisms by which senescent cells drive
disease, and identify new targets for interventions that alter disease onset and/or progression. The Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)/organoid core, led by Drs.
Ellerby and Tracy, will provide expertise in generating iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, microglia, co-cultures
and brain organoids to understand cellular senescence as a driver of age-related neurodegeneration. It will
provide a suite of iPSC cellular models to all three projects and validate all the derived cell types, co-cultures
and brain organoids. The Core will provide essential infrastructure, training and support for all scientists
participating in the PPG. In addition, it will provide everything needed to culture, conduct electrophysiological
recordings, and image cells. The Core directors have experience in all of these cell manipulations and will
approve all Alzheimer’s-related disease (ARD) and control iPSC models for the facility, including live and frozen
cell cultures from commercial and academic sources, to ensure reproducibility, authentication, testing for
mycoplasma, and other cell line maintenance and validation tasks. These Core directors will approve all
Alzheimer’s disease related and control iPSC models for the facility, including live and frozen cell cultures from
commercial and academic sources, to ensure reproducibility, authentication, testing for mycoplasma, and other
cell line maintenance and validation tasks. The Core will train students and postdoctoral fellows and oversee
any research involving iPSCs that require ESCRO approvals, ethics training and MTAs. To accomplish these
goals, five specific aims of the ‘ADRD iPSC/Organoid Core’ are described. These goals are organized around
the cell type or technology that is needed to address the research questions described in the three projects in
an efficient and optimized approach. The Specific Aims of this Core are: Specific Aim 1 – Generate a bank of
iPSCs derived from the indicated models; Specific Aim 2 – Microglia. Generate microglia from iPSCs derived
from the models (Projects 1, 2 and 3); Specific Aim 3 – Astrocytes. Generate astrocytes from iPSCs derived from
the models (Projects 1 and 3); Specific Aim 4 – Cortical Neurons. Generate cortical neurons (excitatory and
inhibitory) from iPSCs derived from the models (Projects 1, 2 and 3); Specific Aim 5 – Cerebral Organoids and
Co-cultures. Provide cerebral organoids (Projects 1 and 3); Specific Aim 6 – Electrophysiology and Imaging.
We will perform electrophysiological recordings for Projects 1, 2 and 3 in both human cellular models and mouse
models. These aims will provide models and technology that will enhance our knowledge of cell type specificity
and interactions in AD cellular senescence and identify new pathways and targets of opportunity to combat AD

The ‘Proteomics and Metabolomics’ Core C will be under the administration of Dr. Birgit Schilling, an independent

from all three Projects. Dr. Schilling, who is also the Director of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Facility at the Buck
Institute, will direct the Proteomics and Metabolomics Core and provide all infrastructure, coordination of MS
acquisitions, and training for all participating project leaders and investigators. The Core is very well-equipped
with a total of seven modern mass spectrometric systems, and four mass spectrometers are dedicated to
proteomics research and workflows. The objective of Core C is to provide a common platform across each
Project for the design, execution and analysis of experiments that involve secreted molecules that are key
signaling regulators generated by senescent cells and subsequent effects on our AD models, including induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and organoids. To achieve the goals of this Program Project, Core C will devote its
efforts to the following work: i) determine proteins present in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) from brain specific senescent cells, ii) determine the components of SASP and exosomes from
senescent astrocytes and microglia or senescent-like neurons and their effects on neurons, iii) investigate
organoids and co-cultures from iPSC models of AD, iv) analyze metabolites and measure NAD levels of
senescent cells, and finally v) determine dynamic changes of post-translational modifications of tau. Core C
specifically innovates, develops, and implements advanced protein analytical technologies, including quantitative
proteomics, determination of protein secretomes and exosomes, as well as monitoring the PTM status of disease
proteins, to advance basic biological and biomedical research. To support the projects and aims of this PPG,
Core C will offer a variety of different mass spectrometric workflows, including data-dependent acquisitions
(DDA) for protein discovery and identification, and data-independent acquisitions (DIA or SWATH) for
comprehensive sampling of the SASP and intracellular proteomes with simultaneous accurate relative
quantification. We will use our orthogonal Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometers, the TripleTOF 6600
and 5600 (SCIEX). We also just ordered an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid (Thermo) mass spectrometer enabling very
deep proteome coverage at very high resolution, sensitivity, dynamic range and also offering excellent
multiplexing capabilities. Our expertise and instrumentation are also particularly well suited for analysis of SASP
that may be dynamically affected during senescence. Continuous system suitability and quality control assays
are acquired to provide highest levels of data reproducibility and scientific rigor. Dr. Schilling’s lab and Core C
will provide all necessary infrastructure and expertise for data analysis and bioinformatic/statistical processing
of the results. We will closely interact with bioinformatics experts in Core A for multi-omics system-wide analysis."
10862753,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the largest single risk
factor is age. At present, there are no effective treatments for this disease. Because AD exacts such an
enormous economic and emotional toll on patients and their families, there is an urgent need to develop new
approaches to understand and manage AD. Core D is significant in the context of this program project
because it provides a new approach to understanding how aging, through the accumulation of a small
population of senescent cells, might drive the neuronal degeneration associated with AD.
 Single-cell profiling allows us to characterize rare subpopulations of cells, such as senescent cells, that
might escape detection by conventional analyses of bulk populations. For decades, we inferred the presence
and properties of senescent cells by profiling gene expression using homogenized tissues, cells or even entire
organisms. This approach led to many discoveries, although increasingly with diminishing returns as we began
to appreciate the role that small populations of cells can have on surrounding cells, entire tissues and/or the
systemic milieu. To enable the planned projects in this PPG, Core D will develop four specific aims.
 In AIM 1, we will characterize cell size and senescent gene expression profiles of astrocytes,
microglia, and neurons induced to senescence in culture, and determine changes in chromatin
accessibility via ATAC-seq. We hypothesize that induced cellular senescence results in a heterogeneous
array of cell sizes and that senescent cells of different sizes have different gene expression profiles. AIM 2 will
determine the extent to which nuclei isolated from senescent and non-senescent astrocytes, neurons,
and microglia reflect the gene expression pattern of intact single cells induced to senesce. Based on a
handful of studies using other non-senescent cell types, we hypothesize that nuclei isolated from these cells will,
to a large extent, reflect the gene expression pattern in intact single cells. AIM 3 will develop and apply a new
technology – spatial transcriptomics -- for in vivo validation of single-cell senescent signatures from
Aims 1 and 2. We will develop this technology to study the interplay between neurons and senescent astrocytes.
In AIM 4, we will apply methods and workflows developed in Aims 1–3 to each of the paradigms being
tested in Projects 1–3. Having established specific protein (Core C) and gene expression signatures for
different cell types as a result of senescence in aims 1 and 2, this final aim will use a novel validation method to
confirm our unique single cell expression signatures in tissue sections or cell models where applicable in each
project.
 Overall our Core will provide powerful new approaches to better understand the role of senescence in
multiple model systems of AD at the level of the single cell."
10862755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is by far the most important driver and risk factor for developing a variety of neurodegenerative diseases,
including the common forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Recent evidence from our
laboratory and others indicate that a cell fate termed cellular senescence is an effective driver of a diverse group
of age-related diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Senescent cells increase with age. Owing
to their complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), senescent cells can have profound effects
on tissue structure and function, and can foster chronic inflammation, a major contributor to numerous age-
related pathologies. There is also recent, albeit sparse, evidence that senescent cells can contribute to age-
related neurodegeneration, including AD and related dementias. Project 1 of this Program Project Grant (PPG)
will characterize in depth the senescence responses, particularly the SASPs, of human and mouse astrocytes,
microglia and neurons induced to senescent by different stressors. It will then determine how these senescent
cells affect the function of non-senescent cells, using both homotypic and heterotypic cell cultures, and a variety
of endpoints ranging from differentiated functions to metabolic state and single cell analyses of transcriptomes
to understand the heterogeneity of senescent brain cell populations. In addition, the Project will use three
dimensional cortical organoids, including organoids containing human cells with wild-type genotypes and those
with genotypes containing mutations that predispose to early onset AD and related dementias. These cells will
be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, Project 1 will take advantage of a novel transgenic mouse
model that permits the selective elimination of senescent cells in order to determine whether and how senescent
cells are causally related to age-related brain function in vivo. These collaborative analyses will complement
experiments proposed by Projects 2 and 3 and rely heavily on Cores B, C and D. Together, these experiments
will provide unprecedented knowledge about senescent cells in the brain, critically test their role in driving AD
and related dementias, and open possibilities for novel interventions into these devasting pathologies."
10862762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia are accompanied by striking changes in systemic and
cellular metabolism. Several recently published results support the model that changes in NAD metabolism plays
a role in AD and that restoration of NAD levels via NAD boosters protect against disease progression. The
enzyme CD38 consumes NAD, increases during aging and mice lacking CD38 are protected from age-related
NAD decline. CD38 levels increase in the brain during disease progression in a double transgenic mouse model
of AD (APP and presenilin-1). Remarkably, deleting CD38 in the APP.PS AD mouse model decreased amyloid-
ß plaques and improved spatial learning, compared to wild-type mice. Our own new observations indicate that
supernatants from senescent cells (SASP) activate CD38 expression in macrophages. These findings suggest
a direct and causal link between senescence, the SASP and aging-associated decreases in cognitive function
during AD via changes in NAD levels. Our working hypothesis is that senescent cells in the brain induce NAD
decrease by inducing the expression of CD38 via their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We
propose:
Aim 1. To determine the NAD metabolome of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in mouse models of AD,
in senescent cell cultures and in AD patient tissue samples. Using flow cytometry, single-cell transcriptomics
(with Core D), proteomic/metabolomics analysis (with Core C), and IHC/IF immunostaining, we will measure
NAD levels and protein expression levels of metabolic enzymes that regulate NAD metabolism in neurons,
astrocytes, and microglia after induction of senescence in culture and in mouse models of AD and AD patient
brain tissues.
Aim 2: To determine the effect of cellular senescence and SASPs on NAD metabolism, proliferation,
using co-cultured microglia, astrocytes and neurons. With Core B and Projects 1 and 3, we will use single-
cell transcriptomics (Core D) and proteomic/metabolomics (Core C) analysis to determine the effect of
extracellular SASP factors on neuron, astrocyte, and microglia NAD levels, expression of NAD hydrolases and
NAD biosynthetic pathways, proliferation, and other phenotypical markers.
Aim 3: To determine the effect of whole body and tissue-specific knockdown of the NAD hydrolase CD38
in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in AD disease progression in mice. We will use a newly developed
tissue-specific CD38 knockout mouse line to test the role of CD38 in each main cell type of the brain in AD
mouse model backgrounds."
10862767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goals of the Program Project are to understand the causes and consequences of cellular senescence as a
driver of age-related neurodegeneration, determine new targets and mechanisms by which senescent cells drive
disease, and identify new targets for interventions that alter disease onset and/or progression. Project 3 will
explore the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms of cellular senescence in Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and related dementia. Senescent astrocytes and neurons displaying senescent-like changes
accumulate in the aging brain, and we hypothesize this is causative in AD. Recent work in Project 1 on mouse
models of Parkinsonism suggests cellular senescence plays a significant role in PD pathology and progression.
A role for senescence in AD is supported by the finding that senolytics (drugs that selectively kill senescent cells)
prevent AD pathology and behavioral phenotypes. We hypothesize that neurons in the brain adopt a cellular
senescent-like phenotype that contributes to AD. We will elucidate key senescent cell types in the brain and
their communication with residing cells that trigger the cascade of events and lead to AD in mouse and human
models of AD. Age-dependent and senescence-driven impairments of neuron function and their responses to
senescent astrocytes or microglia will be examined for their roles in the onset and progression of AD. Therefore,
we will examine proteinopathy-induced neuronal senescence and their response to senescent glia (astrocyte
and microglia). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1. Determine how neurons become senenscent
like and their response to senescent astrocytes or microglia; Aim 2. Determine if cellular senescence drives
pathology and behavioral phenotypes in mouse models of AD; and Aim 3. Model cellular senescent phenotypes
in human cerebral organoid models of AD. These studies will accelerate the discovery of senescence factors
and downstream targets that influence neurodegeneration and allow us to identify better therapeutics targets for
AD and related dementias."
10830461,"Project Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, fatal genetic condition (median age at death was 34 years in 2020). Lung
transplant (LTx) is a treatment for end-stage CF and confers 10 years median survival for adults with CF. In the
U.S., among CF patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 30% of predicted, more
patients die each year than undergo LTx. More than half of CF patients who die without LTx are never referred
for consideration. CF patients with lower socioeconomic status (SES) or non-White race have decreased
referral for LTx and worsened survival. Hispanic CF patients have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of death
without LTx compared to non-Hispanics. Patient preference may account for 25-40% of decisions to defer
referral, but choices may at times be informed by inaccurate assumptions regarding LTx. CF patients with low
FEV1 have high rates of anxiety and depression, which may contribute to avoidance of LTx conversations.
Increasing LTx comprehension, and promoting the process of deliberation, could reduce the number of people
with CF who die without LTx.
We collaborated with CF patients, caregivers, and physicians to develop Take on Transplant (ToT): a web-
based, patient-facing resource for LTx education. ToT shares personal narratives of CF patients and
caregivers and up-to-date, CF-specific, guideline-based medical information about LTx. The overall research
objectives are to test the efficacy of ToT compared to an attention control in a multicenter randomized clinical
trial incorporating mixed methods to assess preparedness for LTx discussions among CF patients with FEV1
<50% predicted (oversampling from communities of concern – low SES, Hispanic ethnicity, or non-White race),
explore the impact of ToT on patients’ psychosocial functioning, and assess patients’ and physicians’
perceptions and use of LTx education. Our research will examine patient-physician interactions and explore
factors that may determine if/when physicians discuss LTx with CF patients in communities of concern (e.g.
perceived eligibility for LTx, implicit bias, assessment of psychosocial factors) and the impact of ToT on
patients’ readiness for LTx discussions.
In line with National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) priorities, our research focuses on improving a
process that disadvantages patients with lower SES, non-White race, or Hispanic ethnicity and leads to health
disparities. We aim to empower patients to discuss LTx. The proposed R01 will test the impact of ToT on
preparedness for LTx discussions, will oversample patients from communities of concern, and will evaluate
patient-physician dynamics, including implicit bias and discrimination, which may limit access to LTx in this
disadvantaged population."
10850670,"Project Summary
Results of epidemiological studies and meta-analyses indicate that treatments for destructive behavior based
on functional analyses, like functional communication training (FCT), typically reduce destructive behavior by
90% or more and are much more effective than other treatments. However, these treatments involve
extinction, which can produce extinction-induced adverse side effects. The most common side effect of
extinction involves an increase in the frequency or intensity of the target response at the start of treatment,
called an ""extinction burst,"" which can place the patient and others at significant risk of harm. Prior theories on
extinction bursts fail to account for the dynamic nature of these phenomena, and the basic behavioral
processes that control bursts remain poorly understood. Our clinical and animal pilot data strongly suggest
that our novel refinement of the generalized matching law, called the temporally weighted matching law
(TWML), which incorporates reinforcement time and reinforcement history into the quantitative model, (a) fits
our pilot data quite well, (b) resolves prior discrepancies between basic and clinical studies on bursts, and (c)
identifies novel clinical procedures for preventing extinction bursts. The long-term goals of the project are to
test our quantitative model of extinction bursts under typical clinical conditions to demonstrate its potential for
improving treatment of destructive behavior and in the lab under a wider range of highly controlled conditions
to provide a formal quantitative assessment of the predictions of the theory, evaluate its boundary conditions,
and identify potential future clinical refinements. The specific aims are to demonstrate that large, discriminable
drops in the rate (Spec. Aim 1), magnitude (Spec. Aim 2), and quality (Spec. Aim 3) of reinforcement when
extinction or FCT are introduced increase the prevalence and magnitude of extinction bursts and that
preventing such drops in the rate, magnitude, and quality of reinforcement will prevent or mitigate extinction
bursts for both applied and basic research participants (i.e., humans referred for destructive behavior and rats,
respectively). Specific Aim 4 will examine potential interactions between the variables of rate, magnitude, and
quality of reinforcement predicted by the TWML to test current and inform future clinical refinements. The
effects of reinforcement rate, magnitude, and quality will be manipulated and evaluated using a within-subjects
design with the human clinical participants and using a randomized group design with lab rats, and the rate of
destructive behavior (humans) and lever pressing (rats) will be the primary dependent variables."
10823326,"Summary: The ability of an organism to reduce the brain blood flow in response to sudden surges in systemic blood pressure
(BP) is known as cerebral autoregulation (CAR). In contrast to term neonates, preterm neonates are not able to reduce
cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to increased systemic BP. In preterm neonates, this exposes fragile cerebral vessels
to a significantly increased blood flow at high pressure, leading to their rupture and brain damage. Our preliminary studies
demonstrate that near-term fetuses can constrict carotid arteries and reduce CBF when systemic BP rises; however, this
capability is not developed in the preterm fetus. We also observed that the constriction of carotid arteries to reduce CBF is
regulated by the adrenergic nervous system, specifically by the activities of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs). These
receptors are expressed at a significantly lower number in preterm carotid arteries. Also, we observed that following the
removal of adrenergic control in the near-term fetus by severing the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) made them lose their
ability to reduce carotid blood flow (CaBF) to the brain with the rise in systemic BP. Thus, after the removal of SCG, both
preterm and near-term fetuses cannot reduce CBF following an increase in systemic BP. During ex-vivo experiments on
carotid segments, we observed that preterm arterial constriction in response to α1-ARs agonist was significantly lower than
those from near-term lambs. Thus, we concluded that reduced activities of α1-ARs play a fundamental role in regulating
CaBF with the rise in systemic BP. We also observed that the reduction in the activities of α1-ARs agonists in preterm
resulted from reduced expression of α1-ARs compared to those in near-term fetal lambs. Furthermore, we present evidence
that DNA hypermethylation reduces α1-ARs promoter activities by luciferase reporter assays and the involvement of histone
modifications. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that promoter DNA hypermethylation and histone modifications reduce the
expression and function of α1-AR subtypes (α1A-, α1B-, α1D) in the carotid arteries and play an essential role in the maturation
of cerebral autoregulation from preterm to term fetus. We will also collect data from both sexes (male versus female) to
identify sex-related changes. The studies will be conducted ex-vivo on isolated carotid arteries and in vivo in chronically
catheterized fetal sheep. The hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Aim 1: From preterm to term fetus in a sex-
specific manner, we will conduct an in-depth mechanistic analysis of promoter DNA methylation and histone modifications
on differential expression of α1-AR subtypes in carotid arteries. Aim 2: From preterm to term fetus, in a sex-specific manner,
we will determine the functional significance of differential α1-AR subtypes promoter methylation, histone modifications,
and gene expression on carotid artery contractility and blood flow regulation to the brain in response to an increase in
systemic pressure. The measurements will be conducted in real-time, in-vivo, with in-utero fetal maturation every week
from 105 to 137 days. This will provide valuable information regarding the role of α1-AR subtypes and the epigenetic
mechanisms involved in the maturation of CAR."
10914985,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Vaccines have been very effective at protecting against infectious diseases that pose
serious threats to human health. However, prophylactic vaccines can also be limited, particularly
if antigenic drift occurs to create variants of the pathogen; this can result in vaccines losing
potency over time, needing boosters to confer protection, and lower neutralization efficacy on
emerging viral variants – consequences which are observed in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent studies have shown that the release kinetics of vaccines can be important in establishing
lasting and efficacious immunity. In particular, extending the exposure to antigens can result in
higher antibody titers and increased diversity of neutralizing antibodies that target a more diverse
set of epitopes, relative to immune responses from conventional bolus vaccination. Furthermore,
vaccines made from protein-based nanoparticles can elicit increased antibody production,
broader antigen cross-reactivity, and a more balanced Th1/Th2 response. This study tests the
hypothesis that the synergy in combining the effects of nanoparticle vaccines for effective antigen
presentation, together with a slower release to give a longer exposure to the vaccine, will elicit
increased durability of the immune response and a broader cross-reactivity for emerging viral
variants.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose to encapsulate protein nanoparticle vaccines with a
biodegradable PLGA-PEG-PLGA (PPP)-based polymer to modulate the kinetics of its release
from an in vivo vaccine depot. This extended-release vaccine strategy will then be applied
towards SARS-CoV-2. We will evaluate the durability of the proposed vaccine strategy’s potency
and the breadth of cross-reactive immune responses toward the variants of SARS-CoV-2 and
other types of coronaviruses. Our specific aims are to: (1) create controlled-release nanoparticle
depot vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and (2) determine the efficacy and immunological
responses to these vaccine nanoparticles that are encapsulated by the polymeric depot. Because
the design of these vaccines is modular and different antigens can be exchanged in a relatively
straightforward approach, the successful implementation of this proposed strategy for coronavirus
antigens could have broader applicability towards the development of vaccines for other infectious
pathogens."

The overall goal of the Appalachian Tobacco Regulatory Research Team (AppalTRuST) is to investigate the
impact of Federal Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (FDA CTP) regulatory policies in rural
communities, a vulnerable and understudied population, through collaboration, education and pioneering
regulatory scientific research. Our multidisciplinary team will investigate this question with two aims.
Aim 1. Facilitate and pioneer regulatory science research in rural communities. Our multidisciplinary
team of researchers will evaluate current and potential regulatory policies across Projects 1-3 that are
methodologically coherent and interrelated with a focus on the regulatory scientific domains of Behavior,
Marketing, and Impact Analysis. P1-P3 will leverage the AppalTRuST Cohort to address the critical regulatory
question of whether FDA CTP policy actions will be beneficial, shifting individuals to lower harm products or
quitting tobacco in rural communities, or not, in a way that assesses the association between outcomes and
level of rurality. P1 will measure the factors associated with tobacco use behaviors of conventional and novel
products, including initiation, progression, dual/poly tobacco use, product switching, and cessation-related
behaviors across levels of rurality over time. P2 will evaluate how FDA regulations may affect patterns of use
for conventional and novel products among young adults across levels of rurality. P3 will use a randomized
parallel groups trial to assess the impact of three proposed tobacco regulations using an Experimental
Tobacco Marketplace to estimate effects of regulatory policies on use behavior across levels of rurality.
Aim 2. Support and create new opportunities for innovative tobacco regulatory science and contribute
to the national efforts to advance TCORS research through education and collaboration. The following
four cores will support the projects to ensure Center coordination, integration, and collaboration: (1) an
Administrative Core to provide efficient, collaborative infrastructure to enhance synergies across the three
program projects and four cores as well as collaboration with the wider TCORS community; (2) a Community
Outreach and Participant Engagement Core to engage rural and peri-urban Appalachian communities to
support our AppalTRuST Cohort; (3) a Biostatistics and Informatics Core to build a centralized, integrated data
warehouse supported by statistical and informatics expertise to collect, harmonize, and analyze data and
provide statistical support for projects and cores; and (4) a Career Enhancement Core to create a
transformative environment offering mentored, multidisciplinary and immersive experiences to expand and
support TRS scholars, with emphasis on the impact of regulatory policies in rural areas. Impact: AppalTRuST
will provide the scientific resources needed to evaluate the effects of the introduction of novel products and
potential restrictions on flavored and high-nicotine products in rural communities so that regulatory decisions
will be made using a health equity lens and guided by a definition of rurality that is diverse and heterogeneous."
10934519,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Rural populations, who use tobacco at almost double national rates, have largely been omitted from studies of
the potential impact of tobacco regulations. AppalTRuST’s overarching goal is to investigate the impact of
Federal Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (FDA CTP) regulatory changes on tobacco product
use in rural communities and examine variation based on relative rurality. The FDA regulatory policies have an
outsized potential to reduce tobacco-related disparities in rural Appalachia and the rest of rural America, given
the relatively limited disincentives for use in these areas (i.e., few smoke-free laws and low tobacco taxes). The
goal of Project 1 (P1) is to close the rural tobacco disparities knowledge gap by documenting tobacco use
behaviors and related factors over time among Appalachian KY adults (18+ years) to inform current and future
FDA regulations. P1 addresses the Scientific Domain of Behavior and will be guided by the Health Belief Model
(HBM). The HBM provides a framework to evaluate associations of knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and
external cues with tobacco use behaviors. P1 will use the AppalTRuST Cohort to enroll 2,000 participants
using a longitudinal cohort design that will collect participant data every 6 months for four years. We will recruit
adults 18+ years from two catchment areas comprising 8 Appalachian KY counties; these two areas represent
a range of rurality and will allow us to make not only catchment comparisons between a rural area and peri-
urban one (i.e., partly urbanized rural areas), but also to assess for associations between tobacco use
indicators and relative rurality within each catchment area. In addition, 40 participants from the Cohort per year
will complete key informant interviews to assess opinions about tobacco products and regulations and allow us
to make annual updates to the survey. We will address the following aims: (1) evaluate baseline prevalence
and longitudinal trends in the use of conventional (cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, hookah, cigars/cigarillos,
and pipes) and novel (e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and very low nicotine [VLN]
cigarettes) tobacco products, including initiation, continuation, switching, cessation, and dual/poly-use among
Appalachian adults, testing for the effect of rurality and controlling for individual- and county-level
demographics; (2) assess changes over time in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions relative to tobacco
product characteristics (including flavors/menthol and VLN), among Appalachian KY adults, while evaluating
the effect of rurality and controlling for demographics; and (3) explore perceived benefits, risks, and intentions
to use novel tobacco products among current tobacco product users and individuals susceptible to initiating
novel product use, with annual key informant interviews to capture reaction to changes in the product and
regulatory landscape. We will evaluate the effects of the introduction of novel products and potential
restrictions on flavored and high-nicotine products in rural communities so that regulatory decisions will be
made using a health equity lens and be guided by a definition of rurality that is diverse and heterogeneous."
10934522,"ABSTRACT – Project 2
Federal tobacco regulatory policies enacted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are critical to curb
the tobacco epidemic in rural Appalachia and reduce cancer burden. Kentucky (KY) is 50th in the nation for
adult smoking rates with 21.4% of KY adults smoking cigarettes, a rate not seen nationally in 20 years.
Kentucky also has wide geographic disparities between rural and urban residents particularly in Appalachian
KY, an economically disadvantaged part of the state. In this context, Federal policies can be particularly
influential in areas with weak tobacco control policies and high rates of tobacco use. In particular, (1) the
introduction of novel non-combustible products, (2) product standards on flavored cigars/menthol cigarettes
and (3) lowering nicotine in cigarettes have great potential to shift the tobacco marketplace, moving rural
Appalachian residents to quit smoking, switch to potentially less harmful products, or never initiate tobacco use
at all. Project 2 seeks to expand the evidence base about the extent to which marketing exposure, tobacco use
behaviors, and attitude towards tobacco products differ across rural communities and the extent to which
regulatory actions by the FDA can potentially reduce use of tobacco among young adults in these areas.
Additionally, few studies examine how the retail environment, novel products, and potential policies could
interact to reduce tobacco-related health disparities among young adult populations by rurality. Tobacco
retailer density is higher in rural areas by population but little is known about how retailers’ market in stores in
this region. The purpose of the study is to examine how marketing and product availability of such novel
tobacco products may change over time and how these patterns may influence tobacco use attitudes and
patterns in rural communities, providing guidance on future policy targets. To accomplish the study purpose,
we will conduct several aims. (1) We will assess marketing trends over time in retail store and digital audits
(store websites and social media) in tobacco retailers in 2 rural catchment areas of KY. (2) We will compare
marketing exposure to and appeal and harm perceptions of novel products in young adults through ecological
momentary assessment (EMA), evaluating differences by rurality at the individual and census tract level. (3)
Finally, among EMA participants, we will assess the predictive validity of exposure to novel product marketing
exposure on use of tobacco at 6-month and 12-month follow-up, and evaluate whether these outcomes are
associated with rurality. For all of these activities, we will partner closely with the AppalTRUST team, cores,
and local community advisory boards to disseminate lessons learned to communities about industry actions
and potential regulatory policies. Achieving the aims of this Project will expand the evidence base of the
potential impacts of FDA policies on reducing tobacco use and potential geographic equity impact of these
policies to reduce tobacco, and ultimately cancer disparities."
10934529,"ABSTRACT – Project 3
Our overall goal, reflecting AppalTRuST’s Integrative Theme of investigating the effects of regulatory changes
on tobacco product use in Appalachian KY, is to assess the impact of proposed tobacco product regulations
using behavioral economic methods that we have developed and refined in past years to characterize the
consumption of tobacco products within the complex nicotine marketplace of Appalachian KY, a diverse and
underserved rural region that would greatly benefit from focused tobacco regulatory science research. This
project primarily falls under the Regulatory Scientific Domain of Impact Analysis. In 2009, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) was granted authority to regulate tobacco products to benefit public health. In the years
since, the FDA has proposed potential regulatory actions that may benefit public health, including regulating
the maximum nicotine content in combustible cigarettes and restricting flavors of combusted and non-
combusted tobacco products. Estimating the impact of any proposed regulatory action is complicated by the
existence of a complex tobacco marketplace containing multiple products that are economic substitutes for one
another and the frequent introduction of new tobacco products by manufacturers. Furthermore, when
compared to more urban, non-Appalachian communities, rural Appalachian communities often have 1) higher
rates of tobacco product use overall, 2) different use patterns that include more combusted tobacco products,
and 3) different product availability in tobacco stores. It is therefore important to estimate any differential impact
of proposed tobacco-product regulations in Appalachia. Using an Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM)
model where product availability is manipulated across groups and demand elasticity and substitution is
measured across tobacco products, we will estimate the impact of regulating 1) nicotine content of combusted
cigarettes, 2) menthol flavor restrictions in combustible cigarettes, and 3) flavor additive restrictions in non-
combusted nicotine/tobacco products including ENDS. Across two aims, we will assess the impact of these
three regulations within Appalachia (Aim 1) and the effect of rurality on impact of these proposed regulations in
Appalachia (Aim 2)."
10934533,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core (Admin Core) will provide leadership and communications infrastructure, strategic
planning, and financial management to facilitate the work of all AppalTRuST components as well as advance
collaboration with the wider TCORS community. AppalTRuST’s overarching goal is to investigate the impact of
Federal Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products regulatory policies in rural communities through
collaboration, education, and pioneering tobacco regulatory science (TRS). Specifically, the Admin Core will
provide scientific oversight by fostering shared knowledge and maximizing interactions to ensure scientific rigor
and transparency. The Admin Core will lead an Executive Committee meeting twice per month with all Project
PIs and Core Leaders. To ensure representation, engagement, and input from the study communities in
Appalachian KY, the Admin Core will collaborate with Community Outreach and Participant Engagement
(COPE) Core to ensure our two Community Advisory Boards are fully engaged in Center decision-making. To
advance educational collaboration and maximize interactions with the wider TCORS community and Federal
partners, the Admin Core will work with the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) to sponsor a quarterly
AppalTRuST TRS Seminar Series to engage the TCORS community and share synergistic opportunities,
methodologic advances, and new research findings. The Admin Core will also collaborate with the CEC to
sponsor an AppalTRuST Visiting Scholar Program to allow faculty and/or trainees from other TCORS to
participate in a one-week in-depth learning experience in rural TRS. To provide quality control and evaluation
across projects and cores, the Admin Core alongside the Biostatistics and Informatics Core (BIC) and COPE
will oversee a monthly quality control and evaluation meeting to foster seamless tracking and coordinating of
all activities, recruitment, participant flow, data collection, and data management. To provide administrative
oversight, the Admin Core will guide and coordinate internal and external communications and coordination,
financial planning and management, as well as the research and grants administrative processes. An External
Advisory Board made up of leading scientific experts will meet annually to provide critical counsel and ensure
the Center is meeting its stated goals. An Internal Advisory Board of key University scientific and administrative
stakeholders will meet annually to provide counsel and advice and ensure AppalTRuST is able to effectively
leverage UK and community resources to meet its goals. Impact: The Admin Core will provide the necessary
organization and leadership to ensure an efficient, collaborative infrastructure that will enhance synergies
across AppalTRuST as well as advance collaboration with the wider TCORS community. Given that
Appalachia is a vulnerable rural region disproportionately impacted by socioeconomic disadvantage and
tobacco use, the Admin Core will lead AppalTRuST in closing a critical knowledge gap in rural tobacco use
behaviors, marketing, and impact analysis to help shape more equitable FDA regulations."
10934537,"ABSTRACT – CAREER ENHANCEMENT CORE
The need for researchers who understand Tobacco Regulatory Science (TRS) and can translate science to
support effective regulatory policies is vital for rural communities which have some of the highest tobacco use
and associated morbidity rates in the nation. The goal of the AppalTRuST Career Enhancement Core (CEC) is
to create a transformative environment that provides mentored, multidisciplinary and immersive career
enhancement experiences to expand and support TRS scholars, with a critical emphasis on the impact of
regulatory policies in rural communities. The CEC will target inquisitive and dedicated scholars with diverse
professional and demographic backgrounds and high potential to become independent TRS researchers.
Building on Center expertise, we will recruit two cohorts of AppalTRuST Scholars, each consisting of two
Faculty Scholars and two Postdoctoral Scholars. These AppalTRuST Scholars will be recruited for a two-year,
non-overlapping experience. Each scholar will work with a mentoring team and participate in multidisciplinary
TRS enrichment activities, enjoying close monitoring of progress toward scientific career independence.
Specifically, AppalTRuST Scholars will receive personalized mentoring and career enhancement experiences
through cohort-building, multidisciplinary TRS enrichment activities including weekly meetings, seminars,
journal clubs and a NIH-modeled grant writing series of workshops. AppalTRuST Scholars will also receive
hands-on experience in TRS research working as part of the research team of one of three AppalTRuST
projects and then developing their own (Scholar-led) TRS pilot project. AppalTRuST Scholars will benefit from
the Cross-TCORS Visiting Scholars Program that will introduce them to scientific domains outside of
AppalTRuST and promote collaborative networks among other TCORS investigators.
CEC will work closely with Project Leads, the Administrative Core, the Community Outreach and Participant
Engagement Core (COPE) and the Biostatistics and Informatics Core (BIC) to ensure AppalTRuST Scholars
have ample resources and opportunities to learn innovative methodologies applied to the rural context. Finally,
CEC will collaborate with the Administrative Core to sponsor an AppalTRuST TRS Seminar Series. Four times
a year, CEC will host these seminars to create collegial and collaborative networks. We will specifically invite
FDA scientists and TCORS faculty and scholars from other TCORS to present and inform AppalTRuST
researchers and the broader TRS community about synergistic opportunities, methodologic advances, and
new research findings across the TCORS community. The seminars will be open to all, as they will be
streamed, recorded, and archived on the AppalTRuST website. Impact. The AppalTRuST Career
Enhancement Core will develop independent scholars who can design and lead rigorous studies that inform
FDA’s tobacco regulatory decision-making in underserved and understudied rural communities, ultimately
reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality."

The Community Outreach and Participant Engagement (COPE) Core will recruit and retain the AppalTRuST
Cohort of 2,000 adults (ages 18+) in Appalachian Kentucky (KY) including a) an address-based probability
sample (PS) of 1,000 participants; and b) a quota-based non-probability sample (NPS) of 1,000 participants.
The Biostatistics and Informatics Core (BIC) will use statistical methods to combine them. Project 1 will use the
full AppalTRuST Cohort (N=2,000), providing an adequate sample to capture estimates of tobacco use
behaviors (e.g., initiation, switching, transitions) over time among subpopulations of interest (e.g., young
adults, tobacco users). Project 2 (n=308, ages 18-24) and Project 3 (n=473 tobacco users, ages 21+) will draw
from the Cohort. All projects, pilots, and TCORS partners will have access to the Cohort data through our
AppalTRuST Data Warehouse.
Using established rural/urban taxonomies, we selected heterogeneous counties that make up a rural
catchment of 5 counties and a peri-urban (i.e., intermediate and smaller cities and towns) catchment of 3
counties, enabling projects to assess contextual- and individual-level effects of rurality on outcomes, enhancing
innovation and our ability to inform more equitable FDA regulations. COPE Aims are to: (1) develop and
implement a culturally tailored community-engaged outreach campaign to promote participation in the
AppalTRuST Cohort; (2) implement strategic recruitment and baseline data collection for the AppalTRuST
Cohort (Project 1) and recruitment into the other projects and pilot studies; (3) implement strategic retention
strategies and administer 6-month follow-up surveys; and (4) disseminate AppalTRuST research findings to
the community to sustain support and retention.
COPE will co-design a community outreach campaign with two community advisory boards (one per
catchment) with promotional materials tailored for Appalachian KY that are strategically disseminated to reach
subpopulations of interest (e.g., tobacco users). COPE will hire, train, and monitor local field staff to recruit and
enroll participants into the AppalTRuST Cohort and manage completion of 6-month follow-up surveys. Cohort
participants will complete 3 to 8 surveys, depending on time of enrollment in Project 1. Multiple strategies will
maximize retention, including our community outreach campaign and monthly contact between participants
and field staff. Our community dissemination plan will report back AppalTRuST study findings to sustain
community support and Cohort retention. The innovative approaches implemented by COPE will support
AppalTRuST in closing a critical knowledge gap in rural tobacco use behaviors, marketing, and impact analysis

10795903,"Dr. Sutha’s long-term career goal is to be a physician-scientist who improves the lives of his patients
through basic science and translational research directed at developing novel therapies for kidney disease,
including acute kidney injury and allograft rejection. A detailed understanding of both acute and chronic kidney
disease pathogenesis and advancement of targeted therapies to treat them remains limited. Development of
novel therapeutics has been hampered by lack of holistic, in vitro experimental models that fully preserve the
complex interactions between epithelial, stromal, and immune components of the kidney. In this work, Ken Sutha,
MD, PhD, a pediatric nephrology physician-scientist, builds upon his expertise establishing a patient-derived,
adult kidney organoid culture preserving endogenous stroma and immune cells, in addition to his primary mentor
Dr. Calvin Kuo’s experience with organoids from other tissues for studying immune processes and diseases.
 First, using his established adult kidney organoids as a platform, Aim 1 will delineate interactions
occurring between kidney epithelia and accompanying stroma in the setting of nephrotoxic injury induced by
cisplatin. These studies will yield insights into epithelial and fibroblast activation and interactions after injury and
will further identify protective versus maladaptive signals in the progression of acute kidney injury to chronic
kidney disease. This knowledge will enable the development of novel strategies to disrupt fibrosis while
promoting repair, which will subsequently be further tested within adult kidney organoids. Aim 2 will then translate
the use of his adult kidney organoids to kidney transplant, using organoids to model the allograft immune
microenvironment, critically while preserving host immune cells within allograft tissue. These organoids will then
be applied to model transplant rejection and treatment response, including functional assessments of immune
activation. Initial feasibility studies will serve as proof of principle for future prospective studies using transplant
organoid treatment response to inform patient therapeutic decisions.
 Dr. Sutha will benefit from the interdisciplinary environment at Stanford University, along with resources
and support available to him through the Department of Pediatrics. With mentorship from Drs. Kuo, Vivek Bhalla,
and Jonathan Maltzman, Dr. Sutha will expand upon his expertise in nephrology and adult kidney organoid
models by developing new, complementary skills in bioinformatic analysis and transplant immunology, critical to
successful advancement of his project. This training will enable the novel application of his established kidney
organoid model to study kidney injury and the transplant immune microenvironment, eventually enabling him to
develop and test new, targeted kidney disease therapies. This approach will be further applied to model other
kidney diseases and treatments using biopsy samples, and results generated from the completion of his K08
Aims will serve as preliminary data for Dr. Sutha’s future R01 investigating cellular interactions and crosstalk in
the progression of chronic kidney disease."

10863920,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sepsis is responsible for one out of every five deaths worldwide. It is therefore essential to better understand
better diagnose and treat sepsis. We propose to use deep RNA sequencing of the whole blood of sepsis
patients to better identify the pathogen causing the disease, triage the appropriate resources, predict
outcomes, and identify novel therapeutic targets. Utilizing novel methods of computational analysis of deep
RNA sequencing data we will assess microbial populations, RNA biology (specifically RNA splicing entropy
and RNA lariats) and identify novel treatment targets/identify patients likely to benefit. Some RNA sequencing
data that does not match the species it came from (human) is typically discarded. We will look at this typically
discarded data for microbial (bacteria and viruses) populations to improve diagnostic ability. To assess the host
response we will study RNA biology. RNA splicing is a basic molecular function that occurs in all cells directly
after RNA transcription, but before protein translation in which introns are removed and exons are joined
together. Over 90% of human genes with multiple exons have alternative splicing events. We hope to assess if
RNA splicing entropy could be a potential biomarker in sepsis. Introns are typically degraded rapidly after
removal during splicing, however, the presence of these lariats could signify RNA metabolism dysfunction and
we will correlate this to outcomes. RNA sequencing data will also allow for application of novel interventions,
such as PD-1 antibodies, to patients most likely to benefit; essentially applying precision medicine to a critically
ill patient. We will utilize whole blood from humans with sepsis and compare to control patients in the intensive
care unit without sepsis. Samples will be collected serially over the course of the stay in the intensive care unit.
We hypothesize that data from deep RNA sequencing obtained during sepsis can be quantified and improve
care."

The principal investigator Dr. Lakshmi’s goal is to develop evidence-based technology interventions that
support chronic disease care in older persons including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early
stage Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). This K24 application will
provide her with protected time to: 1) build skills in implementation science, aging research and the conduct of
research with persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers; 2) accelerate mentoring of early
career clinical faculty in the Department of Neurology particularly on K-awards and transition to the 1st R01; 3)
obtain pilot feasibility and effect size data for a larger clinical trial of a mobile health technology (mHealth)
intervention to improve hypertension (HTN) care in persons with MCI and early stage AD/ADRD. Dr. Lakshmi
is a tenured faculty in the Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School of Public Health (SPH) at

10833652,"Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic changes - functional modifications to the genome that do not
change the DNA sequence and that provide a powerful mechanism by which environmental exposure can impact
gene expression – may contribute to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease (PD). Histone
deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of epigenetic enzymes that regulate gene expression by chemically
modifying chromatin, the network of proteins and DNA in chromosomal structure, in response to life experience
and the environment. In DLB and PD at autopsy, histone acetylation is markedly dysregulated. However, it
remains unclear whether histone acetylation-associated epigenetic changes accumulate with progression of
disease including to dementia, for example reflecting the severity and topography of Lewy body pathology, nor
whether HDAC changes relate to the accumulation of motor, cognitive, and behavioral impairments in these
diseases. It is also unknown whether HDAC expression changes in life in DLB are distinct from those of
Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), which differ in the timing of cognitive and motor impairments. The recent
development of [11C]Martinostat, the first radiotracer that labels HDACs in living humans, has enabled the
antemortem assessment of HDAC levels and distribution in the human brain. [11C]Martinostat shows specific
HDAC binding with low nanomolar affinity and is actively under study in several patient populations. The overall
goals of this proposal are thus 1) to evaluate brain HDAC levels and regional distribution with [11C]Martinostat in
well-characterized PD, PDD, and DLB subjects, contrasted with Alzheimer’s disease and age-matched normal
control (NC) subjects, and 2) to relate accumulation in regional [11C]Martinostat binding over time to Lewy body
disease clinical features and their progression as well as to amyloid burden. Subjects with DLB, PDD, cognitively
normal PD, Alzheimer’s, and NC will undergo standardized neurological examination, neuropsychological
testing, combined [11C]Martinostat PET-MRI, and amyloid imaging with [11C]PiB PET, and will return at 12 months
for repeat [11C]Martinostat PET-MRI and clinical evaluation. Building on preliminary [11C]Martinostat PET imaging
data, we will test the following hypotheses: (1) The order of global brain HDAC expression will increase from AD
to NC to cognitively normal PD to PDD to DLB; (2) Changes in regional HDAC expression detected with PET
will correlate with the known topography of pathologic changes; (3) Cortical and striatal amyloid deposition will
not qualitatively impact these results but will be associated with within-group reductions in regional HDAC
expression; (4) HDAC expression in midbrain and putamen will relate to the severity of motor impairment; anterior
cingulate and caudate expression will relate to the severity of cognitive impairment; occipital cortex expression
will be associated with visual hallucinations; (5) Changes in regional HDAC expression over time will relate to
progression of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairments. Together, these efforts will shed light on the
contribution of dysregulated epigenetic control of gene expression during life to PD, PDD, and DLB."
10804653,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Natural products continue to have a disproportionate impact on how we understand and treat disease. These
biologically pre-validated therapeutic leads have inspired ~50% of FDA-approved drugs, a fact underscores the
importance of studying biogenic chemotypes with unique activity in cell culture. Inspired by the rich opportunities
for natural products at the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine, this proposal focuses on a family of
terpenoids distinguished by a fused [5-8-5] carbocyclic molecular framework. The flagship members of this family
possess impactful, albeit divergent, pharmacological profiles. For example, fusicoccin A stabilizes 14-3-3 protein-
protein interactions (PPIs), ophiobolin A is a cytotoxic membrane disruptor, and bipolarolide A inhibits HMG-CoA
reductase. The specificity of these terpenoids for their diverse biological receptors is determined by the identity
and arrangement of substituents surrounding a common 5-8-5 substructure. Given the complex conformational
dynamics of cyclooctanoids, we postulate that the groups flanking the central eight-membered ring modulate the
overall molecular shape. This potentially programmable feature might allow this terpenoid family to interface with
diverse biological receptors. Thus, the [5-8-5] ring system appears to be a privileged scaffold for the design of
novel therapeutics. However, existing approaches to this family of terpenoids rely on convergent, target-specific
chemistry. Viewed through the lens of drug discovery, the lack of chemistry to diversify the [5-8-5] motif is the
main impediment to understanding and advancing the pharmacology of this natural product family.
 During the past grant period, we developed a synthetic platform to prepare and edit the fusicoccin scaffold.
We now seek to extend this chemistry in several directions. In Aim 1, we will exploit our platform to establish the
features of fusicoccin A that impart selectivity for individual 14-3-3 PPIs. In doing so, we bring a unique chemical
perspective to the long-standing problem of selectively modulating the 14-3-3 interactome. In Aim 2, we will
extend our synthetic strategy to capture ophiobolin A and bipolarolide A. These isomeric sesterterpenes feature
peripheral and skeletal modifications to the 5-8-5 scaffold that cannot be addressed by existing chemistry. We
outline an enabling synthetic entry point to these molecules from a common 5-8-5 intermediate. Thus, successful
completion of the proposed research will establish a divergent platform to chemically redesign [5-8-5] terpenoid
chemotypes. It will also establish whether the fusicoccins can be exploited to interrogate specific components of
the 14-3-3 interactome in cell culture. This research will signifyingly broaden access to [5-8-5] terpenoid natural
products with diverse pharmacological profiles and shed light on how to chemically evolve this chemotype toward
a specific functional endpoint."
10929949,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Advances in neonatal critical care have greatly improved the survival of preterm
infants but the long-term complications of prematurity, including Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cause
mortality and morbidity later in life. After premature birth, transition of the lung to a non-aqueous environment
appears sufficient to disrupt subsequent alveolar growth and the attendant vascular structures required for
effective gas exchange. This is further exacerbated when the preterm lung is exposed to supplemental oxygen
and positive pressure ventilation. Irreversible loss of alveolar capillaries and vascular remodeling after oxygen
exposure cause pulmonary hypertension (PH) seen in patients with severe BPD (BPD-PH). There is an urgent
need for innovative therapeutic approaches to stimulate neonatal lung angiogenesis and preserve respiratory
function in BPD-PH infants. My laboratory recently created PEI600-MA5/PEG-OA/Cho nanoparticles that can
deliver non-integrating expression plasmids with pro-angiogenic genes into pulmonary microvascular
endothelial cells with the purpose of stimulating neonatal lung angiogenesis. We also identified a specialized
subpopulation of pulmonary endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), FOXF1+ EPCs, that are a subset of recently
discovered general capillary cells (gCAPs). Transplantation of FOXF1+ gCAPs increased neonatal lung
angiogenesis and alveolarization in mice with congenital deficiency of alveolar capillaries. We propose to test
the hypothesis that increasing neonatal lung angiogenesis via the nanoparticle FOXF1 gene therapy or the
FOXF1+ gCAP cell transplantation will prevent PH and improve lung function in mouse and rat models of BPD-
PH. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the nanoparticle FOXF1 gene therapy has a long-term beneficial
effect in BPH-PH by preventing PH and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and accelerating lung regeneration
after neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. We will also identify novel downstream targets of FOXF1 in regenerating
endothelial cells and test whether FOXF1 recruits STAT3 to the chromatin to activate endothelial enhancers.
Our studies will determine if the FOXF1-STAT3 protein-protein interactions are required for lung regeneration
in BPH-PH models. In Aim 2, we will determine whether transplantation of donor FOXF1+ gCAPs has a long-
term beneficial effect by preventing PH and RV hypertrophy in mouse model of BPH-PH. We will also test
requirements of the DLL4/NOTCH signaling pathway for the ability of donor FOXF1+ gCAPs to stimulate
proliferation and tube formation in recipient endothelial cells during lung regeneration after hyperoxic injury.
Finally, we will produce mouse FOXF1+ gCAPs from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro (via directed
differentiation of ESCs into FOXF1+ gCAPs) and in vivo (via interspecies mouse-rat chimeras). Mouse ESC-
derived FOXF1+ gCAPs will be used for cell therapy to prevent or delay PH and RV hypertrophy in mouse
BPD-PH model. Altogether, the proposed preclinical studies will directly test whether endothelial delivery of the
FOXF1 vector or cell therapy with FOXF1+ gCAPs have therapeutic potential in BPD-PH."
10821462,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A critical component of the 2035 End TB Strategy is development of improved
methods for Active Case Finding (ACF) of previously undiagnosed TB disease. Most
ACF conducted by national tuberculosis control programs is based on testing
household contacts (HCs) of remotely-acquired but newly-diagnosed cases of TB
disease. This approach typically detects previously undiagnosed TB disease in 2-4%
of HCs.
 We propose to test an entirely new method of ACF based on testing HCs of
adolescents with recently-acquired and newly-diagnosed TB infection. This innovative
method of ACF has the advantage that, since infections were recently acquired, the
source cases are likely still among the close contacts of the new IGRA convertor. For
this reason, we hypothesize that a source case will be found for as many as 50% of
these new convertors.
 This approach is based on results of our recent 3-year study of serial testing for
TB infection among 650 adolescent schoolchildren in Tanzania. The study was based
on annual testing for TB infection using an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA).
We showed that such testing was feasible and detected a 2.9% annual rate of
infection.
 In the proposed new 5-year study we will perform baseline IGRA testing on
1200 Tanzanian adolescents followed by Q4 month IGRA testing x4 on the estimated
1020 who are IGRA negative at baseline. We anticipate detecting new TB infection
(IGRA conversion to positive) in 50 participants. We will then test 200 of their
household and other close contacts (collectively, their close contacts, CC) and predict
that we will identify a source case of previously undiagnosed TB in a minimum of 25 or
50% of these 50 new adolescent infections. The predicted rate of new TB disease
detection among CCs is therefore 25/200 or 12.5%, which is 3-6 times higher than the
current approach for testing HCs of patients with TB disease. Cost-effectiveness will be
analyzed and compared to the current approach used by the National Program on
Tuberculosis and Leprosy.
 Successful completion of the proposed study with the hypothesized outcomes
has the potential for a major impact on global tuberculosis outcomes. It is expected
that the numerous new point-of-care IGRA tests under development will make serial
testing feasible and economical at a programmatic level in low income countries.
 The research study will be conducted with the comprehensive DarDar
Research Program, a 20-year research collaboration between Muhimbili University of
Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS, Tanzania) and the Geisel School of Medicine at
Dartmouth (USA) and will include two consultant epidemiologists with extensive
experience in evaluating TB control programs (Horsburgh, Whalen)."
10836503,"Project Summary
With over 6 million people in the United States diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in 2021, dementia and
dementia caregiving are now major public health concerns. As dementia advances, it becomes increasingly
difficult for the person with dementia (PwD) to recall past events and for these “care pairs” to enjoy activities and
time together. AD caregivers also experience “ambiguous loss”– when the PwD is still physically present but
mentally absent. Research has shown that such losses can exacerbate caregiver pre-loss grief – a painful
yearning for the PwD as s/he used to be, loneliness, and role confusion. Caregiver pre-loss grief is associated
with depression, poor quality of life, impaired medical decision-making on the PwD’s behalf. Caregivers grieve
not just the PwD’s loss of memory and identity, but also the loss of the relationship that they shared. Our micro-
sociological theory of adaptation to loss suggests that caregivers’ well-being benefits from filling the
psychosocial voids created by significant interpersonal loss. In the context of AD, such voids might be filled by
activities enabling caregivers to share memories with the PwD of their common past, reminding them of happy
times, proud moments, feelings of belonging, and of former roles and relationships, while providing an
opportunity to show affection, appreciation, respect, and “play”. Reminiscence Therapy (RT), which uses cues
to trigger recall of significant life events, may address such psychosocial deprivations. Our Living Memory Home
(LMH) web application is an online bereavement resource that we propose to adapt to address AD caregiver
psychosocial deprivations and, thereby, reduce caregiver pre-loss grief while improving the caregiver-PwD
relationship. Aim 1: We propose to adapt LMH for caregivers of patients with early-stage dementia. The LMH
will be adapted to include RT activities led by caregivers. Input from 30 stakeholders (e.g., current/ bereaved AD
caregivers, PwD, dementia experts) will inform the creation of the LMH-4-Dementia Care Pairs (LMH-4-DCP).
Aim 2: To evaluate LMH-4-DCP feasibility, acceptability, and explore effects on outcomes. Care pairs (n=70)
will be randomized to LMH-4-DCP (n=35) or an attention control condition (LMH excluding reminiscence
activities; n=35). User interaction (e.g., logins, feature usage) and satisfaction will be assessed as will primary
outcomes. Hypothesis: >70% of caregivers will find it acceptable, and its use associated with lower caregiver
pre-loss grief and improved relationship quality (primary outcomes) at 1-month follow-up. Effects on caregiver
psychosocial deprivations (e.g., sense of belonging) (mediators) at 2-weeks will be explored. Impact: LMH-4-
DCP will prove acceptable and associated with reduced caregiver pre-loss grief and improved quality of the care-
pair relationship via targeting the reduction of psychosocial deprivations. Results will be used to seek NIH R01
funding of a larger randomized controlled trial of LMH-4-DCP."
10748401,"Project Summary / Abstract
Repetitive behaviors are commonly observed in disorders such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),
Tourette’s Syndrome (TS), and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). These behaviors can have profound
negative effects on patients’ lives and can impair their ability to learn, carry out social interactions, and adapt to
changing environments. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, and behavioral therapy
are moderately effective in treating these symptoms, many patients are refractory to these therapies and there
is a critical need to identify better treatment strategies to help patients with these disabling symptoms. The
striatum is a brain region that plays a key role in integrating information from numerous brain structures and is
essential to modulating habitual and goal-directed behaviors. Converging clinical and preclinical data suggest
that hyperactive dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission through specific circuits in the striatum
may represent common mechanistic underpinnings of abnormal repetitive behaviors. Interestingly, extensive
studies from our lab and others have found that the M4 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor can exert
powerful modulatory control over striatal dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission, raising the possibility
that selective activators of M4 could reverse pathological changes that may give rise to repetitive behaviors.
Here we provide preliminary data demonstrating that M4 PAMs can reduce excessive grooming in SAPAP3 KO
mice (a genetic mouse model that displays a repetitive over-grooming phenotype). This could provide a
breakthrough in identifying a novel approach for treatment of disabling symptoms that are resistant to available
therapies. We hypothesize that repetitive behaviors in multiple animal models displaying repetitive grooming
are associated with hyperactive glutamate and dopamine release in the striatum, and that M4 PAM treatment
can reduce repetitive behaviors by normalizing these forms of neurotransmission. We will test this hypothesis
through a series of electrophysiological and behavioral studies using a combination of genetically modified
mice, optogenetic approaches, and novel pharmacological tools. These studies will provide important
information regarding the physiological role of M4 receptors in regulating basal ganglia function and will
elucidate the therapeutic potential of M4 PAMs in providing relief from repetitive behaviors."
10852982,"ABSTRACT – B Cell Core
Early development of bNAbs in infants suggest potentially distinct mechanisms in the generation of antibody
breadth due to the highly dynamic nature of the infant immune system. Moreover, we have observed elicitation
of bNAb precursors in infant rhesus monkeys with germline-targeting HIV Env SOSIP immunization. We
hypothesize that induction of bnAb precursor B cells using germline-targeting HIV Env SOSIP immunogens
requires specific innate and microbial interactions which are modifiable to enhance future HIV vaccine strategies,
particularly in early life. In this context, we propose a B Cell Core that will perform in-depth quantification and
characterization of the plasma and B cell responses after BG505 SOSIP GT1.1 immunizations in infant
macaques over time through i) the quantification of the functional activity, avidity and target epitope of polyclonal
plasma antibody responses (Aim 1) and ii) single cell RNA sequencing of antigen-specific B cell analysis (Aim
2) to evaluate the evolution of vaccine-elicited HIV bNAb precursors and relate these responses to innate
immunity (Project 1) and microbial interactions (Project 2). To accomplish this goal, the B Cell Core will draw
on the extensive experience and unique resources in antibody and B cell response characterization of the B Cell

10784771,"Summary:
Although memory dysfunction is a frequent and debilitating symptom of traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are
currently no effective treatments available for this often persistent deficit. In addition, the neurophysiological
basis of this dysfunction remains unknown, hindering rational treatment design. There is mounting evidence that
precisely coordinated communications between brain regions are necessary to encode and recall information in
the neuronal ensembles that represent episodic, spatial, and working memory. The hippocampus (HC) is the
most well-studied region of memory encoding and is considered to be selectively vulnerable in both human and
animal TBI. We and others have demonstrated disruptions of oscillations in the HC following TBI, with the loss
of theta a notable finding. Rodent studies have demonstrated that restoration of theta using stimulation
(neuromodulation) can restore aspects of HC dependent memory. However, the mechanism remains unknown,
as does the complex relationship of these neuronal ensembles to oscillations and their correlation with memory
deficits after TBI. Without a deeper understanding of how ensemble coding underlying cognition and memory is
disrupted post injury, rational design of neuromodulatory and other therapies remains challenging. Therefore, a
critical need exists to determine the underlying mechanisms of the disruption of coding in networks underlying
memory formation after TBI, and how a reintroduction of theta restores cognitive function. The overall objective
of the current application is to determine how the coding of memory in the hippocampus and associated circuitry
is disrupted following TBI, and how theta neuromodulation restores function. Our central hypothesis is that TBI
disrupts communication within the larger hippocampal network which disrupts oscillatory interactions required
for encoding and recall of memory in networks of synchronized neuronal ensembles. This hypothesis is based
in part on our preliminary data demonstrating that neurons in the hippocampus synchronize improperly with
oscillations following injury, and that prominent interactions between oscillations are lost. We therefore propose
to determine whether TBI affects phase precession, theta sequences, and phase amplitude coupling in area CA1
of the hippocampus during overtrained tasks designed for these measures, as well as whether both hippocampi
are affected by a unilateral injury. In addition, we will determine the mechanism of learning and memory
dysfunction following TBI by examining neuronal ensemble activity across HC-PFC, quantifying ripple features
and replay, and correlating these measures with behavioral memory function relying on HC-PFC networks. We
will also examine the mechanism of neuromodulatory restoration of spatial/working memory in rats via
simultaneous medial septal stimulation and high-density laminar hippocampal/mPFC recordings.
Accomplishment of these goals will provide the first detailed analysis of disrupted neuronal coding and oscillatory
interactions between brain regions underlying TBI induced memory dysfunction, identify the effects of
neuromodulation on these networks, and lead to clinical treatments for this persistent sequelae of TBI."

Project Description: The FDA Produce Safety Rule has been adopted in its entirety into the Maryland
Annotated Code Agriculture Article Maryland Produce Safety Program §§16-101 to 16-111 2019 and
MDA will follow Program Path C, Regulatory Band 6 and Education and Inventory Band 7, as outlined
in FOA PAR-21-174, to further develop and implement the Maryland Produce Safety Program. The
MD Secretary of Agriculture designated inspection and enforcement authority for Subpart M to the
Maryland Department of Health as they already regulate sprout growers jointly with FDA. The
project will be a collaborative effort with FDA and regulatory and education partners to create and
implement a program that achieves high rates of compliance with the FDA Produce Safety Rule.
Project Overarching Goal: To enhance, develop and implement a Maryland Produce Safety Program
with a focus on quality and national consistency by conducting assessment, planning, regulatory and
educational activities to meet the program objectives.
Program Objectives: 1. Conduct assessments of the Maryland produce landscape, produce- related
event response and program resources to develop a plan for accomplishing program objectives; 2.
Establish foundational resources to implement the plan and ensure program continuity; 3. Provide
education, outreach, and technical assistance focused on compliance with the FDA Produce Safety
Rule; 4. Establish a complete and accurate inventory of Maryland produce farms by fully verifying all
FDA and MDA required data elements; 5. Develop and implement an inspection program focused on
quality and national consistency that is fully integrated with other food safety agencies; 6. Develop
and implement a risk based compliance and enforcement program with a framework for progressive
enforcement actions resulting in the greatest protection of public health; 7. Build on the current
Rapid Response Team structure and authorities to establish capabilities for a coordinated response to

Expected Outcomes: The plans, partnerships, collaboration, and activities of this project will result in
a Maryland Produce Safety Program that enhances produce safety and protects public health as part
of an Integrated Food Safety System. Education and Technical Assistance will provide Maryland
produce farms with the tools to achieve compliance with the FDA Produce Safety Rule. Inspection,
compliance, and enforcement activities will further achieve high compliance rates with the FDA
Produce Safety Rule. A fully coordinated response to produce related events will reduce the impact
of produce contamination on public health."
10894003,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), through the
Division of Fruit and Vegetables (DFV), will be responsible for administering a
comprehensive Produce Safety Program to promote the safe production of fresh fruit
and vegetables and promote compliance with the requirements of FDA’s Regulation
“Standards for Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human
Consumption”. The DFV has worked diligently to develop a produce safety program
that has provided education to Florida’s Agriculture Industry to help prevent food borne
illness outbreaks and promote good agricultural practices.
Over the next five years, the DFV will focus on furthering education and outreach
activities to covered farms directly impacted by the PSR, providing technical assistance
through On-Farm Readiness Reviews (OFRR), compiling a verified farm inventory, and
performing inspections to ensure compliance with the PSR. The DFV expects to have a
well-defined inventory and will plan to educate and provide technical assistance to the
majority of the covered farms in the State of Florida by the end of the project period.
The DFV also intends to provide at least one routine inspection to all covered farms by
the end of the project period and perform follow-up inspections as needed.
By choosing Program Path B, the DFV will continue to conduct produce safety
inspections under FDA’s authority. The DFV will provide its team members with training
opportunities to ensure they have the appropriate knowledge and skill set necessary to
perform their job. The DFV will develop and implement a succession plan. A vetted
succession plan will ensure Florida’s Produce Safety Program will continue to run
effectively and efficiently with minimal interruptions.
The DFV will establish more unified, defined internal procedures for the preliminary
review of inspection documentation. The DFV will create written procedures to conduct
response activities, establish Memorandums of Understanding (or other formal
documents) with internal/relevant agencies and create a Rapid Response Team if
needed. By documenting a plan, the DFV will be able to effectively collaborate with
FDA to identify, coordinate and implement response activities."

Date:4/20/2021
Project /Summary
A primary objective within the Nevada Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) mission statement is to
promote, protect and preserve Nevada Agriculture. As a result, coordinating a state produce safety
education and compliance program is a priority. A self-assessment will be performed to ensure a
comprehensive program is established in Nevada. This assessment will include the following: evaluating
the NDA’s producer certificate program for effectiveness in capturing necessary farm inventory data;
producer education needs; regional challenges; long-term training resources adapted to various
production models; and succession planning. The information obtained through these assessment
approaches will allow for a feasible plan to be developed and implemented involving NDA’s produce
safety education and compliance program.
NDA will further establish a produce safety education, training, and outreach program that is geared at
Nevada producers. This will be done through cooperative agreement funded staff and through a grower
partnership sub-award that will serve as a model working farm for small producers in adopting
preventative food safety measures. This approach is anticipated to prompt participants to initiate
changes that will result in compliance. This program will be formed through participation in Produce
Safety Alliance trainings and by collaborating with FDA and other state programs. Based on previous
experience in coordinating trainings, producers are anticipated to be more likely to attend in state
trainings which is why NDA will be establishing an in-state education, training, and technical assistance
program. Farm assessments will be a component of Nevada’s program to provide one-on-one technical
assistance with farmers.
The NDA will operate under in-state PSR authority (to be established July 1, 2021 through BDR 1100)
and will continue developing a state inspection program. As a result, regulatory staff will attend
trainings as recommended by FDA to prepare staff for performing regulatory services and in establishing
a state regulatory program. A training matrix and Standard Operating Procedures will be established to
ensure inspectors are well trained on farming practices and the PSR. Further to share resources and
ensure consistency among state’s enforcement of PSR, the NDA will coordinate with the Western Region
Produce Safety team, Produce Safety Alliance, FDA, and in-state partners."

10844438,"ABSTRACT
The future challenges of genomic science are enormous. Data sets continue to grow; with high-throughput
technologies, and Biobank datasets, studies with105 cases and107 markers will soon be commonplace.
Electronic health record (EHR) datasets are also rapidly expanding. Health data will soon be routinely collected
from mobile and wearable devices, dramatically increasing their volume and utility. This data is critically important
for advancing the understanding of human diversity and disease. Precision health and predictive medicine raise
the stakes even further. It is imperative that all genomic researchers in the 21st century have a command of the
quantitative and computational Big Data tools necessary for genomic research at this scale.
The goal of this program is to provide training in next generation mathematical and statistical theory and
computational methods for genomics and Big Data analysis. The program is designed for (1) researchers at the
postdoctoral and early career level; (2) more senior biomedical researchers transitioning to more quantitative
genomic research, with the goal of acquiring new research skills or updating existing knowledge; and (3) more
senior computational scientists who wish to apply their methods in a new domain, and gain contacts among
researchers active in those fields. Our program is useful for those trainee researchers whose career focus is
computational methods development, but will also be useful for those researchers who want to add a genomics
methods development component to their research program.
We propose to create a one-week workshop on genomics and next generation computational statistics for Big
Data to be held on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. The week will include a program of
lectures, tutorials, hands-on teaching labs and exercises, and project-based one-on-one sessions with Program
Faculty genomic scientists. The participants will be provided with 1) training in statistical and mathematical
genomics theory; 2) training in the use of statistical and computational methods and tools to analyze genomic
data; 3) training in computational methods development; 4) exposure to cutting edge research; 5) opportunities
to consult, collaborate, and build mentoring relationships with Program Faculty genomic experts from multiple
institutions and specialties. All materials from the one-week course will be recorded and made freely available
online for access to any interested researcher.
A central goal of the program is to help increase diversity in the biomedical workforce. We will plan a vigorous
outreach effort with our well-established network of outreach partners to attract diverse participants. Our very
diverse Program Faculty will aid in our diversity outreach and effective mentoring efforts. In addition, we plan to
offer a series of Diversity Scholarships to attract participants from groups under-represented in the sciences. We
will also offer diversity scholarships to host faculty from minority-serving institutions, to form partnerships and to
assist them in putting our tutorials and educational tools to use in their home institutions."
10870140,"This proposal seeks continued support for an Institutional NRSA that provides post-doctoral
research training to 4 M.D. and/or Ph.D. trainees in endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism.
Also requested are 6 short-term summer medical student training positions. This multi-
disciplinary program involves 32 faculty preceptors in five clinical and basic science
departments of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. It is an integral component of the
training activities of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center. Its goal is to provide
trainees with the knowledge and skills required for independent translational or clinical research
careers. It was previously designed to train both M.D. and Ph.D. scientists in equal numbers.
However, due to the stated NIH goal of increasing clinical research, we will focus our
recruitment efforts on M.D.'s, M.D./Ph.D.'s and Ph.D.'s with more clinical research interests.
This training may be in pre-clinical, translational, or clinical research areas, with emphasis on
providing a basic science experience where appropriate. Trainees will be selected from the
nationwide pool of applicants that traditionally seek training at Vanderbilt. M.D. or M.D./Ph.D.
trainees usually have three to four years of relevant residency training before entering the
program. Ph.D. trainees will be considered for their first post-doctoral experience. Trainees are
selected on the basis of their potential as future researchers and educators. The training
program utilizes a preceptor-based approach, in which the trainee develops a research project
under the guidance of a faculty mentor and mentoring committee. Several criteria are used to
match preceptor and trainee, including trainee interests, quality of the project proposed, amount
of direct supervision that the preceptor can provide, and adequacy of the research funding and
facilities available. Typical research topics include hormone action in humans as it relates to
diabetes, obesity, and metabolic regulation. Research training on this T32 is at most two years,
with the goal of extra training years provided by individual fellowship grants. Training is
supplemented by conferences, seminars, coursework, and career guidance efforts. Trainee
progress is evaluated by the oversight committee twice-yearly and the program is evaluated
yearly by the same committee. In the 46 years of NIH support, the program has supported 132
post-doctoral trainees. Of those who have completed training, over 80% have embarked upon
careers in academia, industry or government."
10877197,"ABSTRACT
 Stemness is a functional cellular attribute defined by properties of multipotency (the ability to produce all
differentiated cell types in a tissue) and self-renewal (the ability to produce new stem cells). In adult epithelial
tissues, stemness can exist in: (1) dedicated stem cells occupying a defined niche, and (2) differentiated cells
that exhibit plasticity to drive regeneration following injury. Stem cells must balance self-renewal with
differentiation, and differentiated cells must balance lineage specific identity with plasticity to participate in
regenerative responses. My lab is interested in understanding how chromatin modifications and their associated
enzymes interact with site-specific transcription factors (TFs) to establish cell identities while simultaneously
facilitating alternative cell fates. We focus on intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which drive the renewal of the intestinal
epithelium approximately once a week throughout adult life, as a model system. Over the next five years, my
research program will explore how TFs and chromatin modifying enzymes contribute to an exit from the
stem cell state as ISC differentiate. Current models propose that rapid differentiation and plasticity in the
intestinal epithelium is regulated by chromatin landscapes that are highly similar across all intestinal epithelial
cell types, regardless of differentiation stage. Recent studies in my lab have challenged this model using a
Sox9EGFP mouse model that allows us to isolate ISCs, progenitors, and differentiated cells with a single reporter
transgene. We quantified changes in chromatin accessibility and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and identified
significant chromatin dynamics at genomic loci consistent with enhancers. Our analyses identified novel
candidate TF-chromatin interactions and raise exciting questions about the importance of chromatin regulation
in adult epithelial stem cells. Our future research will build on this progress to understand: (1) how stem cell-
associated chromatin is decommissioned by TFs in differentiation, (2) how lineage-specific regulatory programs
are “primed” in ISCs, and (3) how chromatin modifying enzymes bridge regulation of self-renewal and
differentiation. The approach proposed here will establish a long-term research program, with broad potential to
expand into studies of plasticity/de-differentiation, chromatin regulation of epithelial responses to environmental
challenges, and development. Our goal is to pursue a basic mechanistic understanding of chromatin regulation
in stemness that will have foundational relevance to human health and disease, including epithelial responses
to inflammation, infection, injury, aging, and tumorigenesis."
10843168,"ABSTRACT — RESOURCE CORE
Prion disease is a fatal, untreatable neurodegenerative disease caused by the prion protein (PrP). PrP,
encoded by the chromosomal gene PRNP and expressed ubiquitously in all mammals, is not pathogenic in its
native state, but causes disease when it misfolds into a ""prion"" capable of conformationally corrupting other
PrP molecules. The goal, uniting all arms of this proposal, is to develop a single-dose, permanent PrP-lowering
gene therapy to treat, prevent, or delay prion disease. Our multi-disciplinary team combines the leadership of
committed patient-scientist, prion biologist and lead PI Sonia Vallabh with the cutting-edge expertise pertaining
to base editing from the David Liu Group, epigenome editing from the Jonathan Weissman Lab, and delivery
vector engineering and manufacturing from the Ben Deverman Lab, which will serve as the Vector Core.
Cross-cutting all areas of this proposal is the need for vectors that can achieve dramatically enhanced CNS
gene delivery for this whole brain disease in human patients as well as preclinical models. This need makes
critical the integration of new breakthroughs in delivery vector engineering as well as expertise in vector
biology, production, quality control, and characterization. Through other ongoing, fully funded projects, the
Deverman lab has engineered improved delivery vectors for the CNS and established a platform for
systematically identifying additional vectors with multiple traits relevant to gene therapy. This proposal will
apply the top candidates from these ongoing projects to the development of a PrP-lowering gene therapy. The
Vector Engineering Resource Core led by Dr. Deverman will undertake process development, production,
formulation, and characterization of delivery vectors in support of the in vivo studies for all three projects in this
proposal; assist with tissue handling and biodistribution analysis; develop a scalable production and analytical
pipeline, and provide technology transfer and oversight for at-scale manufacturing. In the context of this overall
proposal, the Resource Core will underpin the core goal of transforming prion disease therapy with a single-
dose therapy, and also provide a foundational proof-of-concept for the application of engineered delivery
vectors toward systemically-administered CNS gene therapy in adult human patients."
10877031,"The National Institutes of Health reports that > 23 million (~5-8%) of Americans suffer from chronic
inflammatory conditions, many of which involve the pathogenic functions of autoreactive B lymphocytes and
the autoantibodies they produce. Chronic inflammatory conditions also predispose to the subsequent
development of malignancies, such as B cell lymphoma, in the affected cells and tissues. There is thus a
critical window of opportunity in which alleviation of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation can also reduce
future risk of malignancies. However, many of the current treatments for B cell-mediated autoimmunity globally
deplete B cells, which can alleviate symptoms but result in immunosuppression. There is thus an ongoing
need for development and refinement of therapies that target the pathogenic function of autoreactive B cells.
The adapter protein TNF Receptor Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3) acts in a cell-type-specific manner to
suppress B cell signaling pathways contributing to both autoimmunity and malignancy, and loss of TRAF3
protein in B cells by inflammation-induced degradation creates chronic B cell TRAF3 deficiency. This
deficiency in turn predisposes to abnormally enhanced B cell survival and function, leading to autoimmunity in
young adults in a preclinical mouse model, and development of B cell lymphoma in these mice as they age.
This highlights a critical need to define how TRAF3 regulates B cell functions, the long-term goal of this work.
The objective of this project is to address the knowledge gap of how TRAF3 regulates signals via the B cell
antigen receptor (BCR) and the innate Toll-like Receptors (TLR) that are involved in autoimmunity, via the
following Specific Aims: (1) Identify the molecular mechanisms by which TRAF3 restrains BCR signaling and
BCR contributions to autoimmunity. (2) Define how TRAF3 inhibits B cell signals and functions of innate
immune Toll-like receptors (TLRs). (3) Determine how inhibition of TRAF3-regulated BCR and TLR signaling
pathways impacts development of autoimmunity in B cell-specific TRAF3-deficient mice (B-Traf3-/-). The
expected outcome of these studies is a detailed knowledge of how a deficiency in TRAF3, which is associated
with both aging and chronic B cell activation, contributes to B cell-mediated autoimmunity. This knowledge will
be valuable in selection and development of pathway-targeted therapies for autoimmune conditions."
10880291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Risky alcohol use and related behaviors among college students result in significant, adverse outcomes (e.g.,
injury, death). For example, an estimated 1,519 college student deaths each year are associated with alcohol.
Accordingly, these behaviors constitute a serious public health concern that must be addressed across college
campuses. NIAAA has prioritized the identification of interventions focused on reducing college drinking and
these efforts have yielded a number of evidence-based strategies (EBSs), which were recently compiled in the
College Alcohol Intervention Matrix (CollegeAIM; NIAAA, 2015a; 2019). CollegeAIM includes a list of evidence-
based alcohol reduction strategies organized by approach (e.g., individual or environmental), cost, and level of
efficacy. Colleges can use CollegeAIM to identify EBSs to implement on their campuses to combat risky drinking.
Despite NIAAA prioritization and the availability of the CollegeAIM tool and existing EBSs to address risky
drinking, relatively little is known about the adoption and implementation of EBSs for college drinking
among stakeholders (individuals involved with EBS implementation) on college campuses, and further, to what
extent CollegeAIM is used to identify EBSs for implementation. The proposed project will evaluate the use
and effectiveness of CollegeAIM in the selection of EBSs for college student drinking across a statewide
substance use coalition, with a long-term objective of supporting colleges’ use of CollegeAIM and thus,
ultimately the implementation of EBSs to reduce risky drinking. The proposed project aims will be achieved with
a mixed-methods design to assess stakeholders’ use and perspectives of the CollegeAIM tool, identify barriers
and facilitators to using CollegeAIM to select appropriate interventions for their institutions, and identify institution
characteristics that impact CollegeAIM use. This will be the first study to extensively evaluate CollegeAIM as a
tool to identify EBSs on college campuses. The findings from the proposed project also will be instrumental in
developing an organizational decision-support program, intended to be used in tandem with CollegeAIM to
address college drinking, which will be evaluated in a follow-up R01 proposal. The proposed project and training
of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award will be based at the University of
Missouri, an ideal setting given the well-established training programs and group of experts across domains of
alcohol research. The candidate will be mentored by Drs. Kenneth Sher and Kristin Hawley and an excellent
team of collaborators who will support the candidate’s advancement through specialized training in addictions
and implementation science. The candidate will gain the experience with mixed-methods design and analytic
approaches and alcohol prevention research necessary to establish the candidate as an independent
investigator who will be prepared to extend the findings and initiatives of the current study in future R-series
proposals and well-positioned to form an implementation science research program in addictions."
10844577,"A critical barrier to the development of new strategies for preventing costly fractures of the hip, spine, and
proximal humerus is an incomplete understanding of the key age- and disease-related changes occurring in
bone tissue. In particular, little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms by which the deterioration in the
extracellular matrix (ECM) reduces the fracture resistance of bone or increases fracture risk. Non-enzymatic
post-translational modifications (NE-PTMs) are potential contributors to poor ECM because they accumulate in
matrix proteins as fracture risk increases. Therefore, the overall goals of this project are i) to determine which
NE-PTMs of collagen I, the predominant ECM protein of bone, predict bone fracture resistance and are clinically
relevant in osteoporosis and ii) to establish whether non-crosslinking or crosslinking NE-PTMs contribute to a
decrease in fracture resistance of bone and whether they do so via alterations in the structure and hydration of
collagen I. To achieve our goals, we will first generate specimens of cortical bone (dense) and trabecular bone
(spongy) using cadaveric femurs collected from both female and male donors between 50 years and 100 years
of age (Aim 1a). These specimens will be comprehensively analyzed to quantify: bone mineral density, bone
volume fraction, ECM-bound water, secondary structure of collagen I, mature enzymatic & non-enzymatic
collagen crosslinks, integrity of collagen I fibrils, the resistance to yielding (strength), the ability to deform after
yielding (toughness), the resistance to crack growth (fracture toughness), and the resistance to damage
accumulation (fatigue). From adjacent bone samples, we will also extract ECM proteins including collagen I and
quantify NE-PTMs at specific amino acid residues that form its triple helix using mass spectrometry. By fitting
the data to statistical models, we will determine whether the levels of certain NE-PTMs help explain differences
among the donors in fracture resistance, collagen fibril integrity, ECM-bound water, and spectroscopic markers
of helical structure. We will also generate bone specimens from proximal femurs acquired from cadavers without
osteoarthritis (OA) and two types of orthopaedic surgical cases: total hip arthroplasty (THA) for OA and hemi-
arthroplasty (HA) to fix a fragility fracture (Aim 1b). The specimens will be analyzed as in Aim 1a to determine
whether NE-PTM levels are significantly higher while ECM-bound water and fracture resistance are significantly
lower in HA (osteoporosis) vs. THA (OA) or the cadaveric controls. To identify a mechanism whereby NE-PTMs
lowers fracture resistance of bone, we will treat bones ex vivo to accumulate specific types of NE-PTMs (Aim
2a). Following treatment, we will assess the bones to determine which specific NE-PTMs significantly affect the
fracture resistance of bone in a manner similar to that of aging as determined in Aim 1. Lastly, we will perform
molecular dynamics simulations and molecular modeling of collagen I to determine how relevant NE-PTMs affect
the triple helix structure and hydration (Aim 2b). Successful completion of the project would shift the paradigm
of bone health from a focus on bone mass to the inclusion of pathogenic contributions from bone ECM."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium study (HBCD) under the leadership and management
of the HBCD National Consortium Administrative Core (HCAC) will deploy a harmonized, optimized, and
innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an extensive battery of behavioral,
physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand neurodevelopmental trajectories in a
sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at sites across the US. The overarching goal of the HBCD is to
create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-dimensional dataset that will characterize typical
neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will assess how biological and environmental exposures
affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal
exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives,
the HCAC will oversee study design, development of the common protocol, and monitor recruitment and
retention to ensure that the sample of women enrolled includes: 1) a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically
diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman with use of targeted substances
(opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally similar women without
substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. The HCAC will ensure study objectives are met,
monitor performance, provide for training, establish and carry out decision-making and ethical policies, manage
all study communications, and oversee processes for considering study modifications. In collaboration with the
HBCD National Consortium Data Coordinating Center (HDCC), the HCAC will ensure that approximately annual
study datasets are released to the broader scientific community. The HBCD National Consortium study will inform
public policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation."
10898842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aqueous-deficient dry eye is among the most common and debilitating clinical manifestations of systemic
autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. While it is well established that
chronic inflammation of the ocular surface and exocrine glands (e.g., lacrimal gland) represents the
predominant driving force in autoimmune-mediated dry eye disease, pathological alterations in the cornea are
among the most common and debilitating clinical manifestations. With the cornea providing approximately two-
thirds of the eye's focusing power and protecting the anterior eye from environmental, inflammatory and
microbial insult, disease-mediated corruption of tissue function and homeostasis has a vast array of
pathological outcomes. Indeed, a multitude of studies in both human patients and mouse models of aqueous-
deficient dry eye illustrate late stage disease encompasses epithelial barrier disruption, epithelial hyperplasia,
reduced corneal innervation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, dry eye disease induces pathological
changes along multiple levels. However, due to the limited understanding of the cellular makeup of the cornea,
including the lineage relationships of specific cell types, the impact of dry eye on cell heterogeneity and lineage
outcomes is unknown. To help solve this significant problem, we have begun to define the cellular diversity and
differentiation trajectories of corneal cells and how these are perturbed by dry eye disease using single cell
nuclei RNAsequencing in combination with the autoimmune regulatory (Aire)-deficient mouse model. Using this
model, we have also begun to identify novel changes in corneal cell composition during the emergence of dry
eye that may underlie disease development and progression. Based on these data we hypothesize that
disease progression is promoted by an alteration in corneal cell fate that compromises the repair and cellular
replenishment of the tissue. We propose to explore this hypothesis by first defining epithelial and stromal cell
heterogeneity, differentiation trajectories and stem/progenitor cells in the homeostatic cornea. We will then
seek to elucidate the mechanisms by which dry eye disease development impacts the self-renewal,
differentiation capacity and function of corneal cells during dry eye disease development. Outcomes from these
studies will aid in the development of therapeutics to halt disease progression, as well as the generation of
diagnostic targets for early intervention."

Over the next project period, the Indiana Produce Safety Team plans to take a research-to-
practice approach with the intent to further advance the current program standards, ensure the
Produce Inspection Program is consistent with national standards, and promote acceptance and
understanding of rule requirements among growers through education and outreach activities.
It is also expected that with detailed planning, collaboration with industrial partners and other
regulatory agencies, Indiana can further advance its efforts towards achieving a national
integrated food safety system through the implementation of the FDA Produce Safety Rule
(PSR) (21 CFR 112).
Indiana Department of Health (IDOH), as a Path C applicant, is committed to implement the
PSR and conduct produce safety inspections under Indiana state authority (Indiana Code § 16-
42-3.5). This statute can be found at http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2020/ic/titles/016/#16-
42-3.5 with key provisions including the following: Adoption of FDA’s Produce Safety Rule by
reference that authorizes the IDOH regulatory team to implement the PSR as per 21 CFR 112
standards (may not be more stringent than written), and the state may suspend the
implementations of the rule if the federal government does not provide sufficient funds to
administer and enforce the requirements in 21 CFR 112.
Regarding Sprout Inspections (Subpart M), the Indiana regulatory team plans to continue to
follow the lead of the FDA Detroit Office of Regulatory Affairs to set the ongoing inspection
schedule. The Indiana Produce Safety Team’s goal is to begin sprout farm inspections once
inspectors are sufficiently trained.
Lastly over the next 5 years, IDOH aims to verify 100% of the 2088 produce farms using the
2017 USDA National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS) data as a baseline, educating
and/or connecting with 1773 produce farms, and use the “Inspection Frequency” and “Risk-
Based Prioritization” models to inspect farms in the top 30% of the prioritization list every three
years, and the remaining every five years. Annual target farm inspections are estimated at 20%
of Indiana’s non-exempt covered farms, which is approximately 54 farms based on the 2017
NASS data, and with 11 follow-up inspections. Indiana plans to follow the Band 5 for “Education
and Inventory” and Band 6 for “Regulatory” funding assignments for Year 1 and 2, and then
revise its ongoing operational needs based on the updated farm inventory development data."

The FDA's Cooperative Agreement Program for States and Territories to Implement a National
 Produce Safety Program PAR-21-174
 Project Period: 2021-2026
Abstract/Summary
The Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDA) is dedicated to the promotion and protection of
the state's agriculture industry. A 2017 MDA and Missouri Farm Bureau-funded economic
impact study determined that agriculture is the state’s number one industry with more than 88
billion dollars of annual economic impact. According to 2017 NASS data, Missouri has produce
grown on roughly 3,077 of farms. It is estimated that 95% of these produce farms will not be
covered by the FSMA Produce Safety Rule since their sales do not exceed $25,000 or the farm is
eligible for a Tester-Hagan Qualified Exemption.
The Department is well positioned to continue the development of the Produce Safety Program
begun in 2017 under the first FDA Cooperative Agreement for Produce Safety and help growers
achieve compliance with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The Produce Safety
Program clearly supports the Department's mission ""To serve, promote, and protect the
agricultural producers, processors, and consumers of Missouri's food, fuel, and fiber products.""
The Department will pursue “Path B” as outlined in the Funding Opportunity Announcement.
The intention is to oversee both outreach and regulatory activities, enforcing the Produce Safety
Rule solely under FDA authority.
An inventory of farms is critical and methods for capturing the Farm Inventory were carefully
considered so that it can be gathered, maintained, and shared in a manner which supports an
integrated food safety system. The Program will continue to track all Farm Inventory data in the
WinWam database since this software program has integrated well with the outreach and
inspection objectives of the Program.
Throughout the grant period, the Department will continue to partner as appropriate with
Extension at the University of Missouri to provide training to producers. This outreach relies on
seasoned educators working to emphasize key components of the Produce Safety Rule. It allows
the Department to 1) “educate before we regulate”, 2) achieve greater compliance with the
Rule, and 3) minimize the risk of food borne illness no matter who grows the produce.
Finally, the Department has designed and implemented a compliance program to regulate
growers covered by the Produce Safety Rule. It is a cooperative effort with other regulatory
programs within the State, with other states, and in partnership with FDA."

Public health scientists lack reliable data on the burden of many infectious diseases, which is a
barrier to effective control measures. Seroepidemiology provides an efficient means to generate
unbiased estimates of disease burden such as seroincidence, the rate at which new infections
occur in a population. This project supports the development of an open-source R software
package, called serocalculator, to generate seroincidence estimates from cross-sectional
population surveys of serologic antibody response data. Our package will implement an
innovative statistical approach for estimating seroincidence that leverages information about
antibody waning from confirmed cases and overcomes many methodological challenges that
have stymied other approaches. Our specific aims are: Aim 1) Build an open-source, free-to-use
R software package for estimating incidence from cross-sectional serosurveys that is efficient,
reliable, and user-friendly and Aim 2) Enable widespread adoption and sustainable use of our
serocalculator R package through open-source access, a graphical user interface for non-R-
users, and a training curriculum. Our software will fill a gap between theory and practice by
equipping a new community of users with a tool to efficiently estimate incidence from cross-
sectional serosurveys. We expect this tool will be used to generate incidence estimates for a
range of infectious diseases, providing critical information needed to inform disease control
interventions and ultimately reduce the burden of disease."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention
in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care
is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity.
Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough.
Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and
time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology
that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical
workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment.
The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than
any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at
the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument,
we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional
pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on
molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to
conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin
sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients
on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of
technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to
assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results
to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the
detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk”
and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care,
provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening,
enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies."

While significant progress has been made in reducing the malaria burden since the turn of the century, the last
few years have seen a deceleration of this success and the World Health Organization (WHO) in its 2020 World
Malaria Reportestimates ~229 million cases (morbidity) and 409,000 deaths (mortality) in 2019.
Approximately 95% of the global malaria deaths occurred in only 31 countries with seven in sub-Saharan Africa
accounting for ~51% of all the deaths. Furthermore, the WHO predicts no further significant decreases without
greater use of the existing technologies and the necessary development of new tools. The challenges of the
continued demand for new drugs and the slow roll-out of an efficacious vaccine makes urgent the need for new,
cost-effective and efficacious disease-control tools that are safe for people and the environment. This need
justifies efforts to develop genetic approaches for controlling malaria parasite transmission. Long-term,
sustainable genetic control will require the deployment of strategies designed to be resilient to the immigration
of susceptible mosquitoes and parasite-infected people. Genetically-engineered mosquito strains for population
modification have the appropriate performance features for this purpose. Wild mosquitoes immigrating into a
region populated by engineered, parasite-resistant mosquitoes will acquire beneficial genes by mating with the
local insects, and persons with malaria moving into the same region will not be able to infect the resident
vectors, and therefore are not a source for infection of other people. We have exploited the molecular
mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas biology to develop autonomous gene-drive systems for site-specific, transgene
copy number amplification in the mosquito germline. These drive systems carry a cargo of anti-parasite
effector genes that prevent transmission of the parasites by the mosquitoes carrying them. The working
hypothesis is that these systems will be able to impact transmission dynamics even if they confer a genetic load
that impacts reproductive fitness. We shall investigate the impact of gene-drive system insertions on the
recipient mosquitoes to determine effects on reproductive success and drive and effector gene efficacy and
stability. Towards these ends, our Specific Aims are: 1) evaluate the impact of autonomous gene-drive systems
on the reproductive success of Anopheles gambiae ss. and An. coluzzii and 2) evaluate the multigenerational
stability of autonomous gene-drive systems in Anopheles gambiae ss. and An. coluzzii in laboratory cage trials.
The successful completion of these Specific Aims will inform plans and modelling for the future use of this
technology in malaria control."
10880635,"Summary Outreach, Recruitment and engagement (OREC)
In 2050, Hispanic adults over age 65 are expected to account for 20% of the population, up from
7% in 20101. However, they remain underrepresented in research2,3. The situation is even more
critical since Hispanics are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer´s disease (AD). As the
community facing entity of the South Texas Alzheimer´s Disease Center (STAC), the Outreach,
Recruitment and Engagement Core (OREC) will support inclusive, engaged and sustained
participation of diverse older adult populations and their caregivers in South Texas as research
participants in social, behavioral, and biomedical research including clinical trials. Furthermore,
the OREC will strengthen current infrastructure to disseminate and translate research advances
that can impact the engaged communities –local and lay- and has an active mechanism to
obtain community feedback on its services and research, to establish true bi-directional
communication. The specific aims of the OREC are (1) systematically assess community
priorities, needs, barriers to, and interests in AD and related disorders (ADRD) research in
South Texas through conduct of open-ended focus groups, in-depth interviews, and surveys (2)
expand capacity for community-academic partnerships that will support the recruitment and
retention of older urban and rural Hispanics and their families in South Texas and in particular
along the US/Mexico border through a) receiving advice and input from a Community Advisory
Board (CAB) b) providing technical assistance and training to key STAC members in other
cores and c) providing technical assistance and training to key STAC members in other core; (3)
work collaboratively with the other STAC cores to recruit, engage and retain participants; and
(4) disseminate research findings to the scientific community, health care providers and the
communities we serve in South Texas, particularly to elderly and their caregivers. We will
achieve these aims through an integrated program to promote a deep understanding of the
determinants of participation and engagement of diverse and underserved populations of South
Texas and creating and maximizing channels for engagement and community training to
facilitate the adoption of best practices promoting participation in research studies. We will
create a state-of-the art infrastructure for researchers, health care providers, advocates and
policy makers interested in decreasing health disparities affecting older Hispanics affected by
ADRD. To accomplish these goals, we have built a team of scientists with extensive experience
in community change, community–based research, education, recruitment and retention of
Hispanic populations, from two institutions within the University of Texas (UT) system, UT
Health San Antonio and the UT Rio Grande Valley. By integrating and leveraging resources, we
will create a welcoming study environment and through our partnerships and direct access to
health agencies, health care providers, clinicians and community-based organizations of South
Texas we are uniquely positioned to maximize recruitment, assessment and retention of
Hispanics, a group that is underrepresented in ADRD studies."
10880638,"Biomarkers permit a deeper understanding of biology, improve risk prediction, diagnosis and prognostication at
pre-clinical and clinical stages of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). The overall goals of the
Biomarker core (BC) are two-fold: (1) To provide ante-mortem biobanking services for STAC, that is to
collect and store biospecimens for all persons enrolled in the Clinical Core (patients, care partners and
controls), an estimated 265/year at their initial and annual follow-up visits, and similarly collect and store
biospecimens for persons not enrolled in the CC but referred by another STAC core (e.g. population core study
enrollees, clinical trial patients, brain bank donors) and working with the Data, Statistical Management and
Administrative Cores catalog, track and share these samples. (2) To identify biomarkers for detecting
preclinical ADRD, for risk prediction of progression to MCI and ADRD dementia, and for differential diagnosis
and identifying subtypes of ADRD MCI and dementia. The BC is led by Xianlin Han, PhD, a leader in AD
metabolomics/lipomics and Mini Jacob, MD, PhD, studying sensory-motor biomarkers in ADRD. We have
added Co-I Sara Espinoza, MD, a senior geriatrician who is Director of the GRECC and Pepper Center Clinical
Core. To achieve these goals: Firstly, we will collect, process, store, share and track biospecimens
(serum, plasma, peripheral blood monocytes, DNA, RNA, CSF and saliva or stool when indicated), as well as
non-invasive sensorimotor measures from individuals and link to their clinical, imaging, genomic and
neuropathologic data. We will use the latest biochemical and molecular methods and apply best practice
procedures. Secondly, we will validate or identify biomarkers among the Hispanic population by
collaborating with the CC, PNC, GMC, IC and NPC to correlate the markers with clinical diagnoses, course of
disease, imaging and neuropathology. We will make these data publicly available by submitting samples and
curated data to repositories such as NACC, NCRAD and NIAGADS. Thirdly, we will identify novel CSF and
plasma metabolic biomarkers in individuals with Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathophysiology (SNAP)
with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In collaboration with the CC, PNC and IC we will identify
individuals with SNAP with and without T2DM (300-400 in total, half T2DM at rate of ~80/year), identify plasma
metabolic biomarkers distinguishing between classical biomarker-defined AD (A+/T+/N+) and SNAP in persons
with and without T2DM. We expect to find a unique biomarker and metabolic signature in SNAP compared to
AD and in SNAP with T2DM that will help us better understand the biology of SNAP and may help with
diagnosis and treatment. In summary, BC will collect and share biospecimens, and generate and share
extensive biomarker data in Hispanics to establish a unique resource for understanding the heterogeneity of
ADRD in South Texas and for development of AD personalized treatments."
10880641,"ABSTRACT – Population Neuroscience Core
The Population Neuroscience Core (PNC) of the South Texas Alzheimer’s Center (STAC) aims to advance our
understanding of the life course factors contributing to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias,
particularly in the understudied population of Mexican American Hispanic, who face an increased risk of the
disease. To achieve this goal, our team will conduct cutting-edge epidemiological and neuroscience research
to monitor the prevalence and incidence trends of health disparities in dementia, identify life-course risk and
protective factors contributing to dementia, identify suitable and cost-effective biomarkers for risk prediction,
and the develop culturally and linguistically appropriate tools for cognitive assessment in Mexican Americans
from South Texas. The PNC has exceptional resources from existing longitudinal population-based cohorts,
new studies focusing on Mexican Americans with deep phenotyping, and established national and international
collaborations. The PNC aims to additionally close the gap of representation of Mexican Americans in
epidemiological research. This will be achieved by the creation of a PNC sharing resource, where harmonized
data to UDS and other standards in dementia research will be shared with other ADRCs and the scientific
community. This setting allows the PNC to provide cognitively healthy controls for the Clinical and
Neuropathological Cores as well as other ADRCs. Finally, we will train MDs, PhDs, and other professionals in
population neuroscience, to develop skills in quantitative and qualitative research methods by leveraging local
and national level data. The PNC will develop these aims in close collaboration with all STAC Cores.
In summary, the PNC strategically positioned to be a national resource of valuable data from Mexican
American Hispanics living in South Texas, and an asset to collaborative research centered on Alzheimer’s and
related dementias research. We are fully integrated with the other STAC Cores to provide knowledge, data,
services, tools, and training to investigators across the Center, as well as the broader ADRC and scientific
community."

10880726,"Project Summary/Abstract: Administrative Core
The ultimate goal of the UK-ADRC is to catalyze innovative and outstanding AD research while ensuring a
more rapid rate of progress toward new therapies to delay or prevent AD, so that our human volunteers,
patients and caregivers become the beneficiaries of our advances in knowledge. The Administrative Core
provides the foundation, infrastructure, leadership, overall direction, strategic planning, and integration of all
ADRC components to more rapidly achieve this goal and advance our overall theme: “Transitions from Normal
to Late-Life Multi-Etiology Dementia”. This theme builds on our traditional strengths in defining mechanisms
underlying the early changes that occur in individuals as they transition through the cognitive continuum, risk
factors associated with these cognitive states, and how mixed pathology and co-morbidities influence risk and
progression. Two historically outstanding resources of the UK-ADRC that enable research relevant to this
theme are: 1) a strong autopsy program providing clinical-neuropathological correlation and very short (2-4 hrs)
postmortem interval (PMI) research material, and 2) a unique, continuously replenished group of ~500
cognitively intact subjects followed longitudinally, together with another ~300 initially normal individuals who
transition to pre-MCI, MCI or dementia, and all committed to brain autopsy upon death. These signature
resources have contributed to our becoming one of the premier centers defining pathogenic mechanisms
underlying the transitions from normal cognitive aging to the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. The UK-
ADRC functions in a multidisciplinary, integrated, collaborative and supportive team science environment that
catalyzes high-quality AD research within the UK community, region, nation, and beyond. We will continue to
provide the infrastructure, resources and intellectual capital to enhance transdisciplinary research and scientific
interactions, develop new collaborations and partnerships, contribute to national initiatives, and offer innovative
education and training opportunities in the basic and clinical neurosciences. An effective Administrative Core is
essential for transforming our goals into accomplishments. Therefore, the Core will continue to support the
ability of our UK-ADRC to accomplish its goals, and to promote the NAPA research implementation milestones
and goals, through the following specific aims.
Aim 1: Provide leadership, administrative structure, coordination, and financial management to ensure optimal
resource utilization to meet the overall goals of the UK-ADRC.
Aim 2: Promote and catalyze clinical/translational research activities, maximize interactions with other
departments and centers, and foster new avenues of innovative research.

10880644,"Abstract
The Mexican-American (MA) Hispanic community is the most rapidly growing minority and is disproportionately
affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Nonetheless, the prevalence, predictors,
biology and clinical course of dementia, and the care needs of this population remain understudied. The Clinical
Core (CC) of the South Texas Alzheimer Center (STAC) will establish a new culturally, socioeconomically, and
geographically diverse cohort in this underserved region. Recruitment will be done at 3 core sites (San Antonio,
Laredo and Harlingen, TX) using identical protocols. The CC will collect all the prescribed Uniform Dataset (UDS)
data and collaborate with the Imaging (IC), Biomarker (BC), Genetics and Multiomics (GMC) and
Neuropathological (NPC) cores to establish the brain morphology (ADNI3 protocol MRI, amyloid and tau PET),
biomarker (blood, CSF, sensory-motor), genomic (clinical tests, APOE, GWAS, WGS) and pathological
correlates of clinical syndromes to advance our understanding of the heterogeneous pathophysiological
processes underlying ADRDs, especially in MA, using precision medicine approaches. In partnership with the
Population Neuroscience Core (PNC), the CC will define risk and resilience factors for dementia by examining
the impact of vascular, lifestyle, medical comorbidities, environment, culture, and social determinants (UDS+
data) on the transition from normal cognitive aging to dementia. In addition, the CC will create a trial-ready
caregiver registry, examine a caregiver sample (same tests as patients except for PET and LP), and will study
the interactional effect of the patient/caregiver dyad on disease course, care needs, and health outcomes. The
CC will annually enroll 140 individuals with MCI or dementia and 60 cognitively normal controls; >50% will be of
MA ancestry and at least 30% from underserved areas to establish a diverse longitudinal clinical cohort of ~700-
800 persons by year 4 (Aim 1a). The CC will also recruit all care partners of individuals in the clinical cohort into
the caregiver registry and intensively study all willing caregivers, ~45/year from dyad and ~20 who provide care
to ADRD patients who may be too advanced to enroll (Aim 1b). Within these cohorts, the CC will assess the
prevalence of novel and established ADRD biomarkers of pathology, risk, and resilience with disease course
and prognosis (Aim 2a). The CC will provide comprehensive care throughout illness, enabling deep longitudinal
phenotyping and annual collection of biospecimens (BC, NPC), assessing serial change in imaging (IC), and
clinicopathological correlations at autopsy (NPC). The approach will promote engagement (OREC), education
(REC), and clinical trials for all disease stages (Aim 2b). The CC will also genetically characterize the cohort
(Aim 3) and identify biomarkers for biological characterization of Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathology (SNAP,
A-/N+) in persons with and without diabetes (Aim 4). The DMSC will ensure timely, quality data collection and
sharing. In summary, the CC will identify risk/resilience factors, utilize precision medicine approaches to improve
risk-stratification, diagnosis, and prognosis, and enhance research recruitment of a predominantly MA cohort."
10880727,"Project Summary/Abstract: Clinical Core
The Clinical Core of the UK-ADRC maintains a well-characterized, community-based cohort focused on
normal aging and early transitional disease states and follows individuals longitudinally until brain autopsy.
We maintain a mandatory autopsy requirement for all subjects (with the exception of our Minority Gateway
Clinic, where autopsy is promoted but not required), allowing major contributions in the area of clinical-
pathological correlative studies, and definition of early preclinical and pre-dementia disease states. These
efforts have been a driving force in our recognition of the heterogeneity of community-acquired dementia,
including major contributions to the field in regard to LATE, PART, VCID, and the role these pathologic
states play in conjunction with traditional AD, LBD, and FTLD disease states. A major focus of our work has
also been on defining early clinical transitions involving the interplay of these disease states that has driven
the widespread exploration of late-life multi-etiology dementia syndromes. To further such advances, the
UK-ADRC Clinical Core emphasizes deep clinical, biomarker, genetic, and post-mortem phenotyping of a
diverse cohort of elderly subjects at high risk for multi-etiology dementia. Major initiatives in the area of AD
mimics and transitions from normal to late-life multi-etiology dementia are well-poised to continue to move the
field forward in the areas of both diagnosis and translational interventional discoveries. We have introduced
exciting new initiatives in our expansion of antemortem biomarker research allowing an even deeper clinical
phenotyping of our participants as we work towards translational discoveries for multi-etiology dementia. The
UK-ADRC will continue to constantly evolve in dynamic ways through our proposed specific aims.
Aim 1: Maintain & longitudinally characterize a central longitudinal cohort enrolling cognitively normal subjects
to facilitate our understanding of preclinical disease and early cognitive transitions to multi-etiology MCI &
dementia.
Aim 2: Maintain and expand our successful Minority Gateway Clinics to maintain and grow our (significantly)
above-parity for population minority engagement.
Aim 3: Further develop and maintain an infrastructure to support translational therapeutic development through
all clinical trial phases in support of NIH, ADCS, ACTC initiatives, industry-sponsored drug trials, and
investigator-initiated projects.
Aim 4: Foster education and support of research participants and families to ensure that our efforts are
clinically meaningful, both in novel prevention studies as well as treatment in established disease
Overall, the Clinical Core will continue to provide an infrastructure and environment that will continue to
contribute to our success in advancing multidisciplinary, innovative AD research supporting our center theme

investigators with expertise and interest in BIC topic areas, community-based organizations (CBOs), and
community members to synergize efforts and catalyze innovative research. The overarching goal of Aim 2 is to
provide support, knowledge, and skills in diverse contexts to further HIV prevention and care research while
addressing health equity, access, ethics and policy. Aim 3 describes research capacity strengthening activities
of the BIC, which will focus on improving the research climate for investigators and research participants from
diverse backgrounds, including people with disabilities and black, indigenous, and other people of color. Our
core will adopt multi-level strategies, including strong community engagement strategies and mentoring of early-
stage investigators, to improve the climate of research and support investigators from under-represented racial
and ethnic groups. The BIC has multiple strengths that will expand and promote the research priorities of our
CFAR. BIC Directors and Faculty have worked to build, implement, and examine scalable integrated intervention
strategies to facilitate HIV prevention and treatment, all while paying attention to health equity and the disparities
in health care access that have been prevalent for decades. The BIC is multidisciplinary, including psychologists,
epidemiologists, social justice activists, health services researchers, and infectious disease physicians, with
members including HIV and non-HIV researchers funded by NIH. In the next cycle, the BIC will have a strong
focus on building equitable partnerships with community in order to raise community voices, support the
development and advance work of individuals who represent the communities disproportionately impacted by
the HIV epidemic, and expand HIV workforce capabilities. With continued CFAR support, we can make a
sustainable impact on curbing the worldwide HIV epidemic."
10832129,"Abstract
 Advances in HIV prevention and treatment interventions, together with unprecedented investments to bring
these interventions to scale, presents an opportunity to prevent new infections, avert HIV-related morbidity and
mortality, and dramatically alter the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, the full potential of scientific advances in HIV
treatment and prevention has yet to be realized, and efficacious interventions have not been adequately scaled
into effective programs. Implementation science can improve the uptake and effectiveness of these programs,
and impact health at the population level. Given the imperative to translate evidence-based interventions into
widely implemented programs, implementation science is a scientific priority for the NIH, domestic and global
public health agencies, and UW/Fred Hutch CFAR members.
 The UW/Fred Hutch CFAR is ideally situated to continue to link implementation science research with public
health programs both within the U.S., and globally. Our CFAR faculty is at the forefront in defining
multidisciplinary, implementation science research methods, and has developed novel training curricula in public
health and implementation science. Furthermore, CFAR-affiliated investigators lead diverse programs to
implement and scale-up HIV prevention and treatment interventions that have developed strong, collaborative
relationships with health departments throughout the U.S. and internationally.
 In the last competitive renewal, we transitioned the Implementation Science Scientific Working Group into a
Core that developed implementation science expertise within the CFAR community, fostered new
interdisciplinary implementation science research, and linked research and public health activities to promote
implementation science in real-world public health settings. For the next renewal period we propose to continue
high value training opportunities for junior researchers, lead to new and innovative research, and ultimately
improve the speed, efficiency, and quality of efforts to translate scientific evidence on HIV prevention and care
into effective, large scale health programs. The IS Core’s specific aims are to: 1) Build capacity in HIV-
focused implementation science research through short courses and seminars; 2) Increase externally
funded domestic and international HIV-focused implementation science research; and 3) Develop a
cadre of early-stage investigators in implementation science HIV/AIDS research through a Junior
Investigator Mentorship Group. To advance these aims the IS Core will support trainings and seminars to
build investigators’ skills related to implementation science and draw new researchers into the field; provide
consulting and analytic expertise to CFAR-affiliated researchers on grant applications and in support of ongoing
projects in areas related to implementation science; create linkages between CFAR investigators and
international and domestic health departments to identify and cultivate collaborative research; and support three
cohorts of junior faculty for an 18-month mentorship experience to foster competitive research proposals."
10911223,"Project Summary
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affect more than 6.8
million patients worldwide. Because no cure is available to date, treatment is limited to reducing IBD symptoms
such as severe diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue and pain. Although the exact mechanisms that mediate the
pathogenesis of the disease are unclear, excessive proteolysis in the gut combined with dysregulated signaling
of protease-activated receptors (PARs) have been identified as important drivers of IBD and additional
gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. PARs are a unique class of four eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) that are directly regulated by proteolytic cleavage of a peptide sequence in the extracellular N-
terminal domain (NTD). Cleavage reveals a tethered activating ligand or alters the receptor conformation to
induce activation. PAR-signaling can promote inflammation by disrupting the integrity of the intestinal epithelial
barrier, which under physiological conditions allows permeability of nutrients but restricts the entry of bacterial
pathogens and toxins. Many GI diseases are accompanied by loss of barrier function and dysbiosis of the gut
microbiome. Proteases derived from commensal bacteria are likely to be important regulators of gut
homeostasis and pathogenesis, thus making them potential therapeutic targets. However, it is unclear which
extracellular proteases are produced by commensal strains in the gut and how these enzymes affect health
and disease by proteolysis of co-localized PARs. We hypothesize that beneficial commensal bacteria secrete
proteases that keep excessive inflammation in check by basal activation or proteolytic desensitization of PARs.
Conversely, pathobiont bacteria species secrete proteases that promote inflammation via increased PAR
activation. Therefore, proteases produced by the gut microbiota as well as pathogenic bacteria have the
potential to be valuable new therapeutic targets for the treatment of various forms of IBD. To test our
hypothesis, we will develop a robust in vitro assay to broadly screen for proteases with PAR-processing activity
in both commensals and pathobiont bacterial species. We will then identify specific PAR processing proteases
and assess their specific roles in regulating epithelial barrier integrity and inflammation using cell culture
systems and gut organoids. Finally, we will establish the therapeutic relevance of the identified proteases by
confirming their presence and elevated activity in clinical samples isolated from patients with active IBD.
Ultimately, this work will identify specific PAR processing proteases produced by bacterial strains and define
the mechanism by which they impact the pathogenesis of IBD."
10894636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this application we propose to build on our prior work on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to extend these to
diverse ancestry groups. By improving risk stratification, PRSs for common diseases have the potential to
transform clinical practice. However, such PRSs must be available for diverse ancestry groups to ensure
equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential exacerbation of health disparities in
the context of genomic medicine. Our application aims to address the critical need to develop PRSs for diverse
ancestry groups and will focus on coronary heart disease (CHD) and its risk factors: hypertension, diabetes,
obesity and hypercholesterolemia, collectively an enormous health burden world-wide. CHD is the prototypical
complex disease for the use of PRSs given available validated risk prediction equations that bin individuals into
risk categories and substantial reclassification across these categories by a PRS with consequent therapeutic
implications. As part of the PRS Diversity Consortium (PRS-DC), we will develop methods to generate PRSs
for populations of diverse ancestry using existing and new datasets with genomic and phenotype data for CHD
and its risk factors. We will harmonize data elements across these data sets. The methods we develop will be
applicable towards the generation of PRSs for a broad range of common diseases across diverse populations.
The investigative team is part of the Mayo eMERGE IV application and will serve as a bridge between the
PRS-DC and eMERGE. To generate PRSs for diverse ancestries, we will use data from the eMERGE
consortium, Million Veteran’s Program (MVP), the All of US (AoU) program, dbGAP, PRS-DC sites, UK
Biobank, and collaborations with several international groups representing the Middle Eastern, South Asian
and East Asian cohorts. Our application includes several innovations to enable the use of PRSs for risk
stratification and prevention of CHD in individuals belonging to diverse ancestries. Our specific aims are:
Specific aim 1. Integrate and harmonize phenotype data from heterogeneous sources to enable cross platform
phenotyping and generation of PRSs for common diseases in diverse ancestry groups. Specific aim 2. Develop
PRSs for CHD and its major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia) in populations
of diverse ancestry. Specific aim 3. Develop novel statistical and computational methods to account for
diverse genetic ancestry and admixture in models of polygenic risk. Specific aim 4. Develop ‘clinic ready’ PRSs
for diverse ancestry groups by creating reference distributions of a PRSCHD and integrate it with clinical
information to compute absolute risk estimates."

Translation of scientific discoveries into effective clinical interventions and best practices to improve public health
is a complex process transcending traditional disciplines. The goal of the Penn State Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI) TL 1 Training Core is to provide early career scientists with the interdisciplinary training
needed to conduct collaborative translational research aimed at transforming knowledge to benefit human health.
Our program provides opportunities for predoctoral trainees to gain a foundation in clinical and translational
science (CTS) through competency-based, didactic, experiential, mentored training opportunities coupled with
career development activities. Drawing students from both the College of Medicine (CoM) and University Park
(UP) campuses, the TL 1 program is a forum for communication, collaboration, and cross-fertilization of ideas
among students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines including biomedical sciences, medicine, nursing,
nutritional sciences, biobehavioral and social sciences, and bioengineering. In the past funding cycle (2016-
2019), we trained 27 students in our year-long program (22 PhD, 3 MD/PhD, 1 MD/MPH, 1 MD) and 40 students
in our summer program (19 PhD, 21 MD). In this renewal application, we request support for 6 year-long trainees
and 16 short-term trainees per year. Trainees in the 1-year program pursue studies leading to a certificate in
Translational Science, a MS in Clinical Research, or a unique dual-title PhD in Clinical and Translational
Sciences. Training is customized via individual development plans and enhanced by externships and experiential
clinical research, development of leadership, communication, and time management skills, and activities focused
on team science, entrepreneurship, regulatory science, and community engagement. A short-term training is
offered in summer to a mixed cohort of medical and graduate students who are introduced to the fundamental
aspects of CTS in a highly interactive format while conducting mentored research projects. We now seek to
enhance the TL 1 program with aims to: 1) Expand and enhance Penn State's community of predoctoral trainees
engaged in CTS by increasing disciplinary, racial/ethnic and other elements of diversity of trainees by working
with the directors of existing undergraduate pipeline programs, and by developing a new internal pipeline
program to Diversify Research Training in Clinical and Translational Sciences (DiReCTS); 2) Provide
customized, competency-based didactic and experiential training through externships and training in
collaborative team science, coupled with career development activities, structured mentor/mentee training, and
networking activities across CTSA Hubs with shared interests in rural health and health disparities; and 3)
Increase the quality and effectiveness of our CTS training by using a data-driven decision-making approach
involving assessment of the trainees, their mentors, and program outcomes including via CTSA common metrics."
10909241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sensory neuropathy (SN) is the most common comorbidity in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1(HIV-1)
infected-patients (hHIV-SN), which affects 60% of the 37.9 million HIV infected patients in this world. hHIV-SN
is particularly resistant to existing pain relief therapies and now there is no FDA approved HIV specific
analgesic available due to poorly understanding of the hHIV-SN pathogenesis. In order to develop disease-
specific and mechanism-based therapeutics for hHIV-SN, we must fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
Healthy skin is mainly innervated by nociceptors labeled by protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5+) to generate
nociception and the degeneration of PGP9.5+ nociceptor is a critical pathological mark of hHIV-SN. Growth
associated protein (GAP43) labels the newly sprouted nociceptor (GAP43+). PGP9.5+ and GAP43+ nociceptors
have distinctly neurotrophic dependency on glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth
factor (NGF) respectively and the expression of GDNF and NGF are regulated by Wnt5a. Wnt5a is a secreted
signaling protein in the Wnt family that plays an important role in axonal remodeling and is also specifically up-
regulated in the spinal cord of HIV-SN patients with chronic pain. Our publication reported that gp120, an
envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1, plays a causative role in neuropathic pain occurred both in gp120-induced
mouse SN (mHIV-SN) and in hHIV-SN patients. The gp120-caused aberrant activation of neuronal Wnt5a in
sensory neuron and in spinal cord are intimately relevant with the development of SN-associated pain in
mouse and in HIV-infected patients as well. Importantly, our preliminary data have shown that Wnt5a-specific
antagonist, Box5, blocks mHIV-SN-associated pain and pathologies. Interestingly, in both of the mHIV-SN and
hHIV-SN, as PGP9.5+ nociceptor degeneration progresses, even close to the point of denervation, chronic pain
remains or worsens, instead of resolving. This phenomenon indicates that the chronic pain in HIV-SN must be
mediated by an alternate novel nociceptor, the sprouted GAP43+ nociceptor which specifically mediates the
HIV-Associated chronic pain. Our central hypothesis is: HIV-1 gp120 causes mHIV-SN by activation of Wnt5a-
NGF mediated sprouting of the GAP43+ nociceptor, which in turn specifically mediates HIV associated chronic
pain. We will test this hypothesis by using mHIV-SN mouse model in three Aims. In Aim #1, we will fully
investigate the interplay of the sprouting of GAP43+ nociceptors and the degenerating of PGP9.5+ nociceptor in
mHIV-SN by using multiple engineering mouse models. In Aim #2, we will determine that gp120-induced the
sprouting of GAP43+ nociceptor is mediated by Wnt5a-NGF pathway by pharmacological and genetic
approaches. In Aim #3, we will determine the therapeutic potential of antagonisms of Wnt5a by its antagonist,
Box5, NGF antagonism by tanezumab and GDNF to treat mHIV-SN in the gp120 mHIV-SN mouse model.
Results from this research will shed light on the essential mechanisms of HIV-SN and illustrate the therapeutic
potential of Wnt5a-NGF-GAP43 sprouting-based approaches for treating HIV-SN."
10814925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Kidney transplantation (KT) is a growing treatment for older adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but
there is vast heterogeneity in KT outcomes. Older adults are more likely to be listed as inactive (on the waitlist
but ineligible for KT), which is associated with increased waitlist mortality and worse post-surgical outcomes.
Those awaiting KT also experience depressive symptoms, pain, loss of physical function, and social isolation,
which can contribute to waitlist mortality and decrease chances of KT. As of April 2022, 94,249 people were
awaiting KT with an estimated 44% currently inactive. There is a critical need for enhanced models of care to
improve inactive waitlist outcomes. The purpose of this study is to adapt and pilot test the evidence-based
Community Aging in Place- Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE) intervention to address barriers for
KT waitlist activation which involve symptom burden, self-management, social support, health literacy, patient
activation and home function. CAPABLE equips older adults to age in their homes using person-directed
priorities and a strengths-based tailored approach by a nurse, occupational therapist and handy worker (PI:
Szanton, co-primary mentor). CAPABLE improves function, pain, depressive symptoms, and quality of life
while decreasing hospitalizations and nursing home admissions. CAPABLE also improves healthcare
engagement and self-efficacy which are key components to remaining active on the KT waitlist. Our adapted
CAPABLE–Transplant model will extend services to include options for internet access, training, patient portal
usage and patient-directed online social engagement to address the noted isolation. We hypothesize that
decreasing patient and clinician reported barriers will decrease time inactive on the KT waitlist status. We plan
to examine CAPABLE-Transplant among those with inactive KT waitlist status in a two-phase developmental
study leveraging partnership with the JHU Comprehensive Transplant Center and an ongoing, prospective NIA
R01-funded cohort study of individuals awaiting KT for recruitment (PI: McAdams-DeMarco, co-primary
mentor) through the following aims: (1) To develop an adaptation of CAPABLE targeting those currently KT
inactive, (2) To iteratively refine the CAPABLE -Transplant prototype for those currently KT inactive and, (3)
To pilot test the CAPABLE-Transplant intervention in a 30 person 1:1 randomized waitlist control trial delivered
over 16 weeks with outcomes (e.g. waitlist status, symptom burden, social networks) evaluated at 0,16, and 32
weeks post-randomization to test feasibility, acceptability, fidelity of CAPABLE-Transplant and estimate
preliminary effects sizes for a future efficacy trial. To our knowledge, there are no other home-based programs
that address patient-directed goals and the home environment among those inactive awaiting KT. This work
will form the basis for a future R01 to expand to other KT centers and/or into other transplant populations
conducting a larger community-based, efficacy trial."
10834104,"Background: There is a growing body of evidence that nurse staffing (nurse to patient ratio, adjusted
for patient acuity/need for nursing care) and characteristics of the nurse such as experience,
education level, tenure working on specific unit, affects patient outcomes. Except for a few smaller,
single site studies, these investigations have not matched patients with the nurses that directly cared
for them during each shift. Previous studies have only been able to produce limited
recommendations, such as suggested minimum staffing ratios or to increase the percentage of RNs
with baccalaureate degrees. Virtually nothing is known about how individual nurse-patient
assignments impact patient outcomes, thus precluding us from developing smart staffing approaches
tailored to the needs of each patient.
Significance: Match individual patients to the nurses who directly cared for them each shift to
address the current gap in the understanding of how individual nurse-patient assignments affect
patient outcomes. Controlling for other factors known to affect the relationship between nurse staffing
and patient outcomes such as patient acuity and unit- and hospital-level characteristics.
Innovation and Impact: This innovative project will be the first large-scale study of the effects of
nurse staffing that links nurses to patients. It will provide the information needed for VA to effectively
utilize the nurse staffing tools in the Clarvia component of the Cerner electronic medical record.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine the joint effects of the association of nurse staffing levels and
individual nurse characteristics and outcomes for hospitalized Veterans. Examine independent
and joint associations of individual nurses’ characteristics (e.g., education and experience) with the
outcomes of the patients assigned to these nurses’ direct care (in-hospital mortality, failure to rescue,
hospital-acquired infections, and risk-adjusted length of stay (LOS)).
Aim 2. Test how the associations of nurse staffing and nurse characterstings with patient
outcomes are modified by varying unit-shift circumstances. Nurses don’t care for patients in
isolation; the nurses working each shift work as a team and often help each other; we will test how
the effects of this teamwork vary by the staffing levels each shift for the unit as a whole, the
characteristics of the staff each shift, and the unit work, measured by the patient acuity/need for
nursing care and the patient throughput (admissions and discharges).
Aim 3: We will work with the Office of Nursing Services to present the project findings to key
stakeholders to facilate the translation of project findings into recommendations for nurse-
patient assignments that promote high quality outcomes for hospitalized Veterans.
Methodology: VA 2010-2023 nurse staffing data, including the characteristics of each nurse (e.g.,
experience) will be matched with the extensive VA clinical data available for each patient using the
TIU Nursing Assessment extract that must be completed by the nurse caring for each patient, each
shift. Multilevel regression models will be used to estimate the association between the
characteristics of the nurses (e.g., education) who cared for each patient, the nurse staffing level for
each patient and the outcomes for hospitalized Veterans. This will yield both precise estimates of the
effects of nursing input and how this varies by the characteristics of each nurse e.g., the extent that
more experienced nurses can safely manage larger workloads).
Next Steps/Implementation: This project will be conducted in close collaboration with our VA Office
of Nursing Services partners to maximize the potential benefits for the care for Veterans."
10870157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death from infection due to challenges of compliance with multi-
drug regimens lasting 6 months or longer and vulnerable populations including people living with HIV.
Treatment shortening trials for TB have been disappointing. One to get past this obstacle could be stimulating
endogenous host defense pathways to accelerate the response to antibiotics. The anti-diabetic drug metformin
is a candidate host-directed therapy (HDT) agent for TB based on its activation of AMP kinase, induction of
autophagy in macrophages, and expansion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific CD8+ central
memory T(CM) cells. Preclinical data in mice and guinea pigs, and retrospective clinical data from seven
studies of diabetic TB patients support the HDT potential of metformin. We plan to test this in TB/HIV
coinfected patients because they are at increased risk for delayed sputum clearance, death during treatment
and pulmonary impairment after TB. By expanding CD8+ T cells, metformin could be particularly effective in
HIV coinfected individuals and there is a basis to predict that metformin will have direct HDT activity against
HIV. We plan a randomized, placebo-controlled trail of metformin added to standard treatment of pulmonary
TB and HIV. The primary goal of this phase 2A trial to test whether metformin, which causes gastrointestinal
(GI) symptoms, is tolerable and safe in this vulnerable population. The primary endpoint is grade 3 or higher GI
adverse events in the 3-month period of metformin treatment plus 4 weeks after stopping metformin. We
expect that mild GI symptoms will be common but that severe symptoms requiring discontinuation will be rare.
The trial will also test the HDT efficacy of metformin with secondary endpoints of sputum conversion and
respiratory health. The anti-HIV efficacy of metformin will be tested with exploratory endpoints of viral load,
CD4+ T cell count and the occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Biological samples
from this trial will be used to address fundamental questions about the mechanisms of HDT efficacy including
the modulation of harmful inflammation and the expansion of CD8+ TCM cells. If the METHOD trial
demonstrates that metformin is safe in patients treated concurrently for TB and HIV, and if HDT efficacy is
supported, this would provide a basis in evidence for a multi-center phase 3 trial and ultimately inform a
paradigm shift in the treatment of TB."

The risk of dementia increases exponentially with age, with disproportionate effects on blacks and Hispanics. Finding effective treatments for neurological disorders and strokes requires fundamental knowledge of the nervous system and the participation of a diverse workforce to enhance our overall creativity. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Education named the University of California, Irvine, (UCI) as a Hispanic-serving institution, meaning that one-quarter of the undergraduate student body identifies as Latino and that half of all students receive financial aid. More than 50 UCI faculty conduct research in neurosciences, primarily in the Departments of Neurobiology and Behavior (NBB), and Anatomy and Neurobiology. NBB, which was established in 1964, was the first neuroscience department in the world (five years before the formation of the Society for Neuroscience) and it is ranked among the top by the National Research Council. Over the last 18 years, the UCI Minority Science Programs (MSP) has developed innovative interventions to improve the academic excellence and to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates being trained as the next generation of biomedical researchers. The objective of the program Broadening Research Achievement in Neurosciences (BRAiN) for a Diverse Workforce is to facilitate participants’ career advancement from community college to UCI and from college to Ph.D. programs in neurosciences. The measurable objective is to increase by three-fold the number of URM undergraduates entering Ph.D. programs in neurosciences each year. Participants will spend two years being mentored and conducting research continuously. During the sophomore year, participants will join the MSP training laboratory, which is dedicated to developing original research projects while providing a nurturing and stimulating environment for URM students who have not taken upper division classes. Subsequently, participants will join one of the UCI laboratories dedicated to neurosciences. Participants will take courses in neurosciences, scientific writing and training in the responsible conduct of research. At the end of the program, participants will have attended 30 research talks by neuroscientists, developed strong quantitative reasoning skills (including computer programming), presented their research findings at two national conferences, participated as co-authors on a paper based on their research experience and gained admission to Ph.D. programs in neurosciences at top universities."
10749051,"In recent years, new technological advancements in small molecule analyses (e.g., lipidomics) have
identified a biochemical manifestation of impaired wound healing: the development of an imbalance between
pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids1-9. The synthesis of eicosanoids begins with the initial rate-limiting step,
the generation of arachidonic acid (AA) via the activity of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)10-12. One of the major PLA2s
involved in this initial step is group IVA cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2α)10-12, which the Chalfant laboratory demonstrated
is activated by direct binding to the sphingolipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P)13-19. Employing newer lipidomic
technology, we discovered that C1P is temporally regulated and specifically increases in the inflammatory phase
of human wound healing5. To evaluate C1P-induced eicosanoids in wound healing, we created a knock-in mouse
with the C1P site in cPLA2 ablated (KI). Our preliminary data show that KI mice, unlike the wild-type (WT) and
cPLA2 knockout (KO) mice, exhibit dramatically enhanced wound healing. These beneficial effects were linked
to the loss of inflammatory prostaglandins (e.g., cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived PGE2) and increased production
of specific lipid mediators (i.e., lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived 5-HETE), which induced significantly accelerated
migration of dermal fibroblasts and neutrophils. Importantly, in an initial study, we also found that high levels of
5-HETE in wound fluid from human pressure ulcers are linked to a better healing outcome. Thus, a balancing
act between LOX- and COX-derived lipid mediators is critical in the wound healing process.
 Initial mechanistic studies also showed that relevant cellular phenotypes and variant production of
eicosanoid classes observed in KI cells are linked to a differential cellular localization of the C1P-ablated mutant
cPLA2 via association with PIP2. The findings provide a foundation for the premise that, when cPLA2 is unable
to bind C1P, the enzyme becomes free to associate with other lipid regulators (e.g., PIP2) that drive the
production of specific LOX-derived eicosanoids (e.g., 5- HETE). This mechanism is supported by our preliminary
in vitro studies showing that C1P blocks the activation of cPLA2α by PIP2. As LOX and COX products are both
cPLA2-dependent, but temporally contrast in their biosynthesis20.21, our data suggest that an overlooked
complexity in cPLA2 regulation exists in response to inflammatory agonists. Thus, we hypothesize that the
enhanced wound healing of pressure ulcers will reflect a novel “lipid-class switch” producing pro-healing
eicosanoids involving the complex, antagonistic regulation of cPLA2 by C1P and PIP2 metabolism. We also
hypothesize that aging humans, who display ineffective wound healing, will have ulcerative wounds lacking
these pro-healing lipid mediators, and a lipid signature will act as biomarker of healing outcome. To test these
hypotheses, we will employ a multi-disciplinary team, novel genetic mouse models, and “state of the art”
lipidomics and molecular biology technologies to explore the underlying mechanisms and bioactive lipids
associated with aging and the non-healing of ulcerative wounds."
10815548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly lethal form of liver cancer which has been rising in incidence
worldwide and carries a prognosis of under one year. The current standard of care for the majority of patients
who present with advanced stage disease remains toxic combination chemotherapy. However, recent genetic
studies have determined that many ICC tumors harbor mutations which can be treated with ‘targeted therapies.’
Such targeted therapies may often be given as a pill form and generally have fewer side effects than
chemotherapy. As a result, there is now hope for a shift in the therapeutic paradigm for ICC, from the current
standard of combination chemotherapy for all patients to targeted therapies for ICC patients who have
‘targetable’ mutations. The most common of these mutations in ICC fall within a gene called isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH). Although clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapy
in IDH mutant ICC, early trial results suggest that sequential or combinatorial strategies will be needed to induce
durable remissions in this disease. In our previous work, we used laboratory models of IDH mutant ICC such as
human cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to show that IDH mutant ICC cells are extremely
sensitive to a targeted therapy called dasatinib. Dasatinib acts to kill IDH mutant ICC cells by inhibiting the activity
of a protein called SRC. Interestingly, this dependence on SRC activity appears to be highly specific to IDH
mutant ICC cells when compared to cells from ICC tumors that do not have IDH mutations or tumor cells from
any other cancer tested. This proposal aims to couple traditional molecular biology and biochemical approaches
with advanced technologies such as phosphoproteomics, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, and
polyribosome profiling to uncover the unique functional role that SRC plays in IDH mutant ICC and to elucidate
why this specific genetic subset of ICC is so dependent on SRC activity. This work will be benefited by our unique
reagents, consisting of a large panel of ICC model systems, including human cell lines and PDXs as well as the
rich and highly collaborative scientific environment at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute. Ultimately,
the long-term goal of our work is to improve our understanding of the distinct biology underlying these tumors in
hopes of developing more effective, and less toxic, therapeutic options for ICC patients."
10902102,"SUMMARY
Significance: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most prevalent urologic diseases, and it is caused
primarily by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Bladder infection by UPEC is characterized by a transient
intracellular stage during which bacteria invade superficial epithelial (facet) cells and divide within the cytosol to
form multicellular communities called biofilms. After replicating in the cytosol, bacteria exit the intracellular biofilm
– killing the bladder epithelial cell in the process – and disseminate to naïve facet cells or to the upper urinary
tract. While in the intracellular biofilm state, bacteria evade innate immune responses and the effects of
antibiotics. Similarly, in catheterized individuals, formation of biofilm on the catheter surface creates an additional
protective niche for UPEC, from which it can disseminate to the bladder and seed infection. The goal of this
proposal is to evaluate the potential of inhibiting biofilm by interfering with UPEC respiration.
Rationale and Hypothesis: Although UPEC are facultative anaerobes, they respire oxygen during infection in
the hypoxic bladder environment. Aerobic respiration and oxygen sensing have also been linked to the
expression of critical UPEC virulence factors. We have previously shown that aerobic respiration is essential for
UPEC to establish infection. Of the three respiratory quinol oxidases encoded by UPEC, cytochrome bd has the
highest affinity for molecular oxygen, exceeding the affinity of mitochondrial cytochrome c by 1000-fold. Deletion
of the cydABX genes that code for cytochrome bd, does not impart a growth defect in vitro, but leads to significant
alterations in UPEC biofilm architecture, leading to higher susceptibility to antibiotics in the biofilm state.
Furthermore, cydABX deletion mutants are non-motile, exhibit decreased proton motive force (pmf) and are
attenuated in a murine UTI model. Finally, deletion of cydABX results in increased expression of the low affinity
quinol oxidase cytochrome b0. We hypothesize that cytochrome bd can be chemically targeted to thwart
biofilm formation or dissemination from a pre-formed biofilm. We further posit that cytochrome bd has
a role in energizing motility. We propose two aims to test the posed hypotheses:
Aims: Aim 1 will will evaluate whether targeting of cytochrome bd using known cytochrome bd inhibitors can
enhance antibiotic effectiveness. Aim 2 will determine whether the decreased membrane potential of the
cytochrome bd mutant imparts generalized or specific effects on pmf-dependent processes and determine how
these impaired processes affect motility. Finally, using chemical inhibition of cytochrome bd we will evaluate
whether loss of cytochrome bd function impairs dissemination from the biofilm.
Impact: These studies will be the first to address the unique contribution of cytochrome bd on UPEC motility and
will determine whether targeting bacterial respiration is a viable therapeutic or prevention strategy against UTI."

these early studies have documented that marriage and health are indeed interrelated, there
has been little consideration of the implications of other key features of the African context, such
as different marriage patterns and customs (e.g., early marriage, polygyny), persistence of
traditional gender norms, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, for the link between marriage and health.
The limited body of research in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that it is a unique and important
setting to study the relationship between marriage and health, with social norms, infectious
diseases, and marital practices that differ from contexts where most research on marriage and
health have been set. In this proposed study, we intend to use a rich, longitudinal dataset to
examine the link between marriage and health in Malawi. In doing so, we address several
methodological challenges that have affected research on this relationship. We use longitudinal
data and statistical approaches to reduce common biases in examining the connection between
marriage and mental and physical health, such as unobserved characteristics associated with
both marriage and heath, and the selection of individuals with different health status into marital
change (mainly remarriage and dissolution). We take advantage of detailed retrospective
marriage histories to identify union start and end dates, status of marriage (still married,
divorced/separated, and widowed), reasons for divorce/separation, and polygynous unions. We
also combine data from husbands and wives to produce a couple-level dataset that is used to
conduct dyadic analyses. We use a validated instrument (the SF-12) that measures multiple
dimensions of mental and physical health, as well as specific subscales of each (e.g.,
depression, anxiety, physical functioning). We analyze data from individuals aged 15 to over 80
years, which allows us to account for differences in the marriage-health relationship across the
life course. Finally, we take advantage of data collected from migrants who have left the study
area to minimize attrition bias and account for the connection between marriage and migration."
10813172,"Rare diseases affect 1 in 20 people, but fewer than half of the ⇠10,000 catalogued rare diseases have a re-
solved genetic etiology. Genetic association analyses of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from large,
phenotypically diverse collections of rare disease patients enhance the discovery of novel etiologies, compared
to within-study analyses, by increasing the probability of multiple cases sharing a genetic etiology and by boost-
ing the number of controls (Turro et al., Nature 2020). The Gabriella Miller Kids First (KF) program has germline
WGS data from 20 studies on 18,547 probands or relatives of probands with a birth defect or pediatric cancer.
However, due to the bioinformatic and statistical challenges of analyzing such large and complex WGS datasets,
a comprehensive cross-cutting genetic association analysis has never been performed. We present a research
program of computational and statistical approaches to uncover novel germline etiologies of rare diseases in KF
and replicate them in other cohorts to which we have access. In Aim 1, we will build a compact and portable
relational database containing a sparse representation of all the rare variant genotypes in the KF WGS data. Due
to natural selection, almost all pathogenic variants responsible for rare congenital or hereditary disorders are rare
and will thus be included. We will annotate the variants with scores reﬂecting their predicted deleteriousness and
their minor allele frequencies, and with their predicted molecular consequences. We will load sample-speciﬁc
information into the database, including pedigree membership, membership of a maximal set of unrelated partic-
ipants (MSUP) and group memberships for case/control association analyses. In Aim 2, we will develop a web
application allowing authenticated users to browse variants by gene or sample. The web interface will allow users
to click on sample IDs directly in a table of genotypes to view the phenotypes of individuals who are heterozy-
gous, homozygous or compound heterozygous for a given consequence class of rare variants in a side panel.
The application will also host and display the results of inference, such as posterior probabilities of association
(PPAs), posterior probabilities over the mode of inheritance, posterior probabilities over the consequence class of
pathogenic variants and posterior probabilities of the pathogenicities of variants. The application will be accessi-
ble by authorized collaborating experts across disciplines. In Aim 3, we will obtain a PPA between each gene and
each of a collection of case sets in KF in accordance with each study's data restrictions, if any. We will determine
the case sets using Mondo Disease Ontology and Human Phenotype Ontology terms assigned to cases. We will
select probands in a given case set using pedigree information and compare them to participants not in the case
set who are in other pedigrees and in the MSUP. We will attempt to replicate ﬁndings with a PPA >0.95 in our
previously deployed databases encompassing >100,000 individuals and using GeneMatcher. The deployment of
powerful, lightweight and portable analytical frameworks across different patient collections, promises to advance
etiological discovery and replication of the remaining unknown causes of congenital disorders."
10887485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Arterial thrombosis resulting in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of combined morbidity and
mortality worldwide. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only drug approved to treat AIS.
Unfortunately, only ~5-10% of patients who present with AIS actually receive rtPA. Risks of rtPA treatment
include a significant increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which occurs in up to 6.4% of
patients who receive the drug. Moreover, rtPA only achieves 10% recanalization in patients who present with
large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. These clots, which are commonly platelet-rich, are notoriously resistant to
rtPA. A critical need exists to develop thrombolytic agents that: 1. target critical proteins involved in
stroke clot architecture, 2. recanalize arterial occlusions, and 3. have a safety profile superior to rtPA.
Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is an optimal target for AIS treatment. VWF binds to glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) of
the platelet receptor complex GPIb-IX-V as well as to GPIIb-IIIa, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation.
VWF also self-associates, extending into the vessel lumen as a scaffold for platelet and red blood cell adhesion.
These processes result in arterial thrombosis as seen in AIS patients. Our preliminary data of cerebral thrombi
from stroke patients show that the majority of clots have a platelet shell rich with VWF encapsulating the
thrombus core, providing an explanation for the poor arterial recanalization rate associated with rtPA.
Aptamers are oligonucleotide-based drugs that inhibit their target proteins with high affinity and specificity. We
have isolated and optimized an RNA aptamer that binds to and inhibits VWF (DTRI-031). We have also
designed a second oligonucleotide (DTRI-025) that fully reverses DTRI-031 activity within minutes. Our
data in small and large animal models of thrombosis demonstrates that DTRI-031 both prevents thrombus
formation and lyses fully formed arterial occlusions better than rtPA. The overall goals of this proposal are to 1)
correlate elevated plasma VWF to clot VWF in AIS patients and 2) demonstrate VWF inhibition by DTRI-031 can
translate into an effective treatment for patients who present with AIS.
We will test the hypotheses that 1) VWF is an optimal target for AIS treatment. Our preliminary data shows
that LVO AIS patients have significantly elevated plasma VWF. Our preliminary data has replicated these
findings in a murine model of stroke. 2) DTRI-031 effectively lyses clots in vitro in blood samples from AIS
patients and in vivo in a murine model of stroke. Moreover, DTRI-025 rapidly reverses DTRI-031 activity in AIS
in vitro and in vivo. 3) DTRI-031 treatment improves outcomes in a murine model of AIS by increasing
recanalization, decreasing infarct volume, and improving functional recovery. Our preliminary data reveals that
DTRI-031-treated mice have reduced post-stroke infarct volumes compared to control. Finally, DTRI-031 has an
improved safety profile by decreasing ICH, cerebral edema formation and blood-brain-barrier breakdown after
AIS compared to rtPA."
10878856,"Project Summary/abstract
Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a genetic dysplasia characterized by brittle bone, increased bone fracture and low
bone density. Current OI management relies mainly upon long-term anti-resorptive treatments that prevent
fractures, yet may interfere with normal jaw bone healing. A novel strategy for OI treatment is Sclerostin Antibody
(SclAb), which induces a strong anabolic response to increase bone density. Although SclAb increases bone
formation and significantly improves the biomechanical long bone properties, long-term continuous dosing
rapidly decreases bone-formation response by increasing Wnt antagonist expression. Cycling SclAb treatments
with antibody-free periods restores bone-formation response based on long bone research, so little is known
how this strategy affects jaw bone and implant osseointegration (bone healing). Successful implant stability
(primary healing) and osseointegration (long-term healing) depends on good bone density. Therefore, to predict
jaw bone density in OI before and after implant placement, there is a clinical need to biomark SclAb-induced
anabolic effects. The use of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for OI is attractive. Found to play key roles in
the regulation of bone homeostasis-related pathways, bone-remodeling-related miRNAs may possibly replace
the current nonspecific bone density diagnosis tools, resulting in a personalized medicine approach for OI
treatment management. There are 2 aims in this study. Aim 1: Elucidate the optimal SclAb-cycle therapy regimen
that induces and sustains the jawbone formation response and its effect on osseointegration. Aim 2: To
determine the bone-remodeling-related miRNA panels that detect or predict SclAb treatment outcome to guide
implant placement decisions. The results of this proposal will provide both the SclAb therapy schedule that
induces and sustains the optimal bone anabolic effects without affecting the healing and miRNA panels of
anabolic and resorptive phase that can be used to correlate the SclAb effects on bone metabolism for dental and
orthopedic treatment decisions and long-term disease monitoring of low bone mass patients.
The candidate is firmly committed to a career in developing effective, clinically applicable orofacial bone
regeneration strategies to improve the quality of life among low bone mass disorder patients. Her Mentor,
Advisory Committee Members and the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department at the University of Michigan
School of Dentistry strongly support the candidate and her career and research goals. She currently holds a
position as an Assistant Professor with 20% protected time for her PhD research project. The proposed
experiments and didactic work will position her with a unique set of cross-disciplinary skills, enabling her
transition to independence as a surgeon-scientist with a focus in Translational Craniofacial Regenerative
Medicine."
10873166,"Abstract
Since 2010, clinical medicine has benefited from a rapid surge of clinical research on chronic diseases using
data from electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are appealing because they can offer large sample sizes,
timely information, and a wealth of clinical information beyond that obtained from either health surveys or
administrative data. However, while millions of patient records are included in large EHR records, they are not
population-representative random samples, a constraint that potentially biases inferences based on such data
and, therefore, has limited their utility for population health research. EHR data typically contain multiple types
of biases, particularly: 1) sampling inclusion bias: EHR data only include information on patients visiting
participating medical systems, and they primarily capture data when patients are ill. Even among populations
with a particular disease, patients represented in EHRs tend to over-represent individuals who are sicker and
have higher health care utilization; 2) sampling frequency bias: the numbers of patients’ encounters and
features in EHRs are at various frequencies and these frequencies correlate with both patients’ characteristics
and outcomes; and 3) institution bias: EHR samples of any hospital reflect the characteristics of patients
population served by that specific hospital. Consequently, EHR-based risk prediction models will have 1)
biases in risk factor selection and estimation for population inferences; 2) disparate mistreatment (unfairness)
in terms of variation in a model’s prediction accuracy across patient subgroups (such as gender, race, and age)
with various sampling inclusion probabilities or frequencies; 3) biased prediction model to reflect characteristics
of patients served by the local hospitals. We propose to develop: 1) effective sample-weighting method to
correct biases in risk factor selection and estimation for population inferences (Aim 1), 2) flexible deep learning
method for EHR personalized risk prediction with fairness criteria (Aim 2); and 3) innovative calibration method
to improve reproducibility of EHR-based risk models between institutions (Aim 3). We will predict risk of
subsequent incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as a demonstration
of methodology development. Broader use of these methods will be generally applicable to other diseases
outcomes and population of interest. To develop and validate these methods, we propose to analyze three
unique datasets: 1) the New York University Langone Health EHR data (NYU-CDRN, 2009 to now) including
demographics, vitals, diagnoses, lab results, prescriptions, and procedures; 2) the New York City Clinical Data
Research Network (NYC-CDRN)—an EHR network comprising 20 NYC healthcare institutions, including the
NYU-CDRN, with longitudinally linked data on >12 million patient encounters under a Common Data Model,
and 3) the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS, begun in 1992 and ongoing), as a benchmark population-
based cohort, that has nationally representative health interview data for over 20 years, as well as biomarkers,
physical assessment information, prescription drug data, and claims linkages."

Candidate and Career Development Plan: Dr. Browne is an assistant professor practicing vitreoretinal surgery
and functioning as an engineer and physician-scientist at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Browne
established his engineering and basic biological sciences skills as a PhD student. He has balanced clinical duties
with his laboratory research activities and. His long-term career goals are to engineer functional imaging tools
that will advance the understanding of early and advanced eye diseases and facilitate the therapies needed to
treat humans. His training thus far has been using in vitro imaging alone. To achieve his career goals, he is
requesting support for training to develop functional imaging tools in vivo and the molecular tools to correctly
interpret Two-photon imaging (2PI) observations from animal models. This K08 award will enable Dr. Browne to
develop his scientific and professional skills in advanced imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and retinal cellular
biology applied in vivo. Dr. Browne and his co-mentors, Drs. Palczewski, Seiler and Kuppermann, have
developed a hands-on strategy to fulfill the training requirements through relevant course work, didactics,
laboratory techniques, and collaborations at UC Irvine. The training program will prepare Dr. Browne to submit
R01-level proposals to independently investigate and optimize functional retinal imaging as a tool for therapeutic
discovery.
Research Plan: Many blinding retinal conditions, like age-related macular degeneration, are the consequence
of biochemical dysfunction and the secondary effects of inflammation and cell death. Conventional clinical tools
provide valuable structural information about the retina but are unable to visualize retinal function. Non-linear
optical imaging can now reveal subcellular biochemistry in vitro and has emerged as a reliable tool to study
retinal disease. 2PI in mouse models demonstrates subcellular changes in energy and light cycle metabolism.
Cell replacement therapy has emerged as a therapeutic candidate for advanced vision loss, and preclinical trials
in rats have demonstrated visual function restoration. To understand metabolic function in retinal organoids
(RtOg) before and after transplantation into blind rats, we will employ functional 2PI in vitro and in vivo as outlined
in the following specific aims. 1) Investigate RtOg maturation with 2PI and correlate functional imaging data with
cell-specific reporters in vitro and molecular signatures post vivo, 2) Identify functional imaging biomarkers for in
vivo metabolism using 2PI of normal rats and rat with retinal degeneration, 3) Study in vivo functional 2PI of
transplanted RtOgs in rats to identify alterations in functional imaging biomarkers and correlate imaging findings
with visual function testing. Completion of these aims will yield time-resolved metabolic detail for specific cell
populations in developing RtOgs, avail novel in vivo information about retinal biochemistry in healthy retina,
diseased retina, and diseased retinas treated with retinal sheet transplantation. These discoveries will guide
future translation of both functional imaging and tissue replacement therapy in humans."

 This program project grant (PPG) proposes to explore important, fundamental aspects of aging that can
result in the loss of brain function that occurs during aging. This loss of brain function, often termed
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), imposes enormous emotional and financial burdens
on citizens of the United States, and worldwide. Core A will organize and coordinate the entire PPG, and will
be crucial for the success of its scientific goals. The Core will be led by the PPG Principal Investigators Judith
Campisi and Lisa Ellerby. It will provide essential functions to the PPG, which will be implemented through
seven interlinked specific aims. These aims include facilitating communication and collaboration among the
Projects (Projects 1-3) and other Cores (Cores B-D), organizing regular meetings among the Project and Core
personnel and members of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), which will provide critical assessments of the
scientific and administrative progress of the PPG. Core A will also provide budgetary and administrative
support and oversight, be responsible for communicating with the National Institute on Aging (NIA), including
submission of progress reports and discussions of any new or altered scientific directions. In addition, Core A
will facilitate and organize training and travel for SAB members and, importantly, for junior participants in the
PPG (students, postdoctoral fellows, critical support personnel). Finally, Core A will provide unified high-level
statistical and bioinformatic support to the entire PPG through dedicated hardware, software and personnel
overseen by Buck faculty member David Furman. Through these aims and services, Core A will provide
critical central administrative and scientific support to the PPG, which will optimize the success of its scientific

10837700,"1. SUMMARY (Imaging Core) 
The overall goals of the Imaging Core are to obtain amyloid PET and high caliber MRI data to characterize 
Stanford ADRC participants along the AD and PD spectrums; to make these data available to a wide range of 
investigators at Stanford; and to provide training on the acquisition, interpretation, and analysis of imaging data 
relevant to neurodegenerative disease. The Imaging Core, capitalizing on Stanford's strength in brain imaging 
and radiochemistry, will focus on incorporation of amyloid PET imaging in conjunction with structural and 
functional MRI, and enable innovation for the exploration of novel PET targets. Dr. Greicius, the Core Director, 
has helped advance the application of functional connectivity measures to the study of AD. Dr. Mormino, the 
co-Director of the Imaging Core, has made contributions to characterizing the preclinical stage of AD using 
amyloid and tau PET. A second major focus of the Imaging Core will be to make the acquired data available to 
and readily used by researchers across disciplines and schools at Stanford. The Imaging Core will use the 
RedTree infrastructure to provide researchers with summary imaging data for PET (global and regional 
amyloid and tau PET values), structural measures (regional gray matter volume and thickness values), and 
resting state functional measures (network connectivity). The imaging data will be linked to subjects' ancillary 
data (including neuropsychological measures, spinal fluid proteins, plasma proteomics, etc.). This will allow the 
widest possible set of Stanford investigators, with or without imaging expertise, to test hypotheses using the 
ADRC data. The availability of amyloid PET and MRI data on the majority of clinical core participants will 
greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy which will fundamentally strengthen any clinical research undertaken at 
the Stanford ADRC. These imaging data, in conjunction with biofluid data from the Biomarker Core, will also 
enable classification according to the recent research framework of AD so that Stanford ADRC data can be 
more readily harmonized with data from other centers."
10878795,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Healthcare disparities are meaningful differences in healthcare quality linked to patient race,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), or other factors. There is a vital element of healthcare quality with a
paucity of data on disparities: compassion from treating clinicians. Compassion is highly valued by patients and
essential for high quality healthcare. For example, a lack of clinician compassion could contribute to patient
distrust of the healthcare system, which is associated with patient non-adherence to health maintenance and
treatment recommendations. Understanding compassion disparities is vital for improving healthcare equity.
Health disparity populations may receive less compassion from clinicians due to implicit bias and/or racism.
However, our prior research has shown that conventional after-care patient experience (satisfaction) surveys
are prone to nonresponse bias and thus are inadequate to test for compassion disparities. Anonymous, real-
time, point-of-care assessments are needed. This is a critically important knowledge gap for healthcare equity.
Compared to nondisparity populations, we hypothesize that (1) patients in health disparity populations
experience less compassion from clinicians, (2) less compassion for health disparity populations mediates
healthcare system distrust, and (3) salient clinician behaviors that communicate compassion (or lack of) from
the patient perspective differ for health disparity populations. Objectives: In a diverse population of primary
care patients, (1) we will test for differences in patient experience of clinician compassion between White
patients without low SES and (a) Black or African American, (b) Hispanic or Latinx, or (c) low SES patients.
(2) We will test if patient experience of clinician compassion mediates differences in healthcare system distrust
between the populations above. (3) From the patient perspective, we will identify differences in salient clinician
behaviors that communicate compassion (or lack of) between the populations above. Methods/environment: In
a network of 26 diverse academic primary care clinics, we will perform a cross-sectional mixed methods cohort
study collecting anonymous, real-time, point-of-care assessments of clinician compassion from the patient
perspective (n=350). We will use the 5-Item Compassion Measure, a semi-quantitative research tool that we
validated in three prior studies including real-time evaluation. We will test for differences in the populations
above adjusted for patient, system, and clinician-level factors. We will also use the validated Healthcare
System Distrust Scale to test if clinician compassion mediates (i.e., is on the causal pathway for) patient
distrust of the healthcare system for the populations above. We will use open-ended questions (i.e., qualitative
methods) to identify salient differences in clinician behaviors that communicate (or detract from) compassion
from the patient perspective for the populations above. These data will inform a future R01 application to
develop and test patient-informed training curricula for clinicians to raise compassion for health disparity
populations and reduce patient distrust of the healthcare system through elimination of compassion disparities."
10794379,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aggressive forms of periodontitis associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) are often difficult
to treat with traditional means (scaling and root planing, in combination with systemic antibiotics). During
infection, Aa produces a leukotoxin (LtxA) that kills host immune cells, thus reducing the host’s ability to clear
the infection. Although an association between LtxA expression levels and pathogenicity of Aa has been well
documented, particularly in adolescent patients, and the mechanisms by which LtxA kills host cells have been
well studied, few new treatment options have been developed in recent years. We propose that LtxA represents
an ideal therapeutic target that could be exploited to develop next generation therapeutics for Aa infections in
juveniles.
The long-term goal of the PI is to develop LtxA-focused therapeutics for the treatment of Aa. The overall objective
of this project is to construct a liposome-based, LtxA-responsive antibiotic delivery vehicle to treat Aa infections.
The general hypothesis is that LtxA will enable antibiotic release only in the presence of pathogenic (LtxA-
expressing) strains of Aa. The general hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Optimize
liposome composition to promote LtxA adsorption and LtxA-mediated disruption and (2) Determine the
therapeutic liposome concentrations necessary to enhance host cell survival. In Aim 1, we will optimize the
composition of the liposome to enhance LtxA-mediated antibiotic release and LtxA adsorption. In Aim 2, we will
test the effect of the liposomes on host cell survival in a co-culture model of infection. At the successful
completion of the proposed research, the expected outcome is a novel therapeutic option to treat Aa infections
in adolescents. The innovation of the proposed work lies in its use of LtxA as a therapeutic target, as well as the
development of a controlled antibiotic delivery vehicle for the treatment of aggressive periodontitis. These results
will provide a strong basis for the future development of LtxA-focused therapeutics, which is expected to have a
significant impact on the clinical treatment of Aa-associated infections in juveniles by providing additional, non-
surgical options. This research aligns with NIDCR’s mission to improve oral health through its development of a
new treatment for periodontal infections."
10662642,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite advances in the development of highly effective androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapies for the
treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer, acquired resistance ultimately ensues. Lineage plasticity has
been proposed as one mechanism of therapeutic resistance whereby patients with resistant disease develop
AR-negative, androgen signaling-indifferent prostate tumors that lose their luminal identity and display
neuroendocrine features (neuroendocrine prostate cancer, NEPC). While NEPC tumors share many genetic
alterations with prostate adenocarcinoma, the potential drivers of lineage plasticity remain understudied. Using
a novel genetically-engineered mouse model that faithfully recapitulates the transition to NEPC, I have
established an organoid-based allograft platform that is amenable to gene editing technologies. Using single-cell
based approaches, Furthermore, I have identified a previously undescribed tumor subpopulation with a unique
transcriptional regulator that may represent an transition between adenocarcinoma and NEPC. For the proposed
studies, I will modulate the expression levels of the identified transcriptional regulator using CRISPR-based gene
editing or overexpression strategies in prostate organoids and determine how the transition to NEPC is affected.
I will also assess the sensitivity of this tumor subpopulation to clinically-relevant treatment options, including
androgen withdrawal and AR-targeted therapy. Finally, I will reveal how targeting epigenetic modifiers changes
the composition of tumor subpopulations and reverses the development of therapeutic resistance. Alongside
these scientific aims, I will use the period of support to enhance my skillset and develop as an independent
researcher. Through a comprehensive plan, including workshops, course work, clinical case conferences, and
attendance at seminars and scientific conferences, I plan to develop a deeper understanding of bioinformatics
at the single cell level, expand my exposure to critical barriers facing clinicians and prostate cancer patients, and
successfully continue my transition to an independent research position. The environment at Weill Cornell
Medicine, and among its closely aligned neighboring institutions, is ideal for me to complete the proposed studies
and will help foster my continued research and career development success."

Brain tissue of demented individuals is studied for diagnostic and research purposes using a
multidisciplinary approach. The NPC combines data obtained by neurohistology, and
immunohistochemistry to reveal the presence of abnormal proteins and determine their
localization through the CNS. The NPC has expanded its mission by integrating genetics with
neuropathology. Such integration is fundamental to understand disease etiology, pathogenesis
and phenotypic heterogeneity. This multidisciplinary approach is the hallmark of the IADRC’s
NPC and contributes to providing a definitive diagnosis of dementing disorders. The NPC
supports numerous national and international scientific programs, providing scientific insights
along with tissue samples from the brain library. Results from studies carried out by
investigators of the NPC are presented at national and international conferences, including the
annual Alzheimer Association International Conference (AAIC). In the study of patients with

genetic data and generation of blood-based biomarkers. The GBBC also supports multiple
national efforts through the broad sharing of specimens and data.
The GBBC leverages the unique patient populations and genomics resources at Indiana
University School of Medicine to support each Core as well as the overall goals of the IADRC.
The GBBC fosters new research directions through the common banking of samples from
diverse research groups. These samples are then available to address research questions that
are central to the interests of the IADRC. In addition, these samples are available for
collaborative studies, thereby enhancing the power of all ADRC studies focused on disease
susceptibility, onset and progression.
In this application, the GBBC will expand its scope to also support functional studies through the
targeted development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The GBBC will leverage both
the IUSM-JAX-Pitt MODEL-AD Center, whose goal is to develop, characterize and test
therapeutic strategies in mouse models of AD and the IUSM-Purdue TREAT AD Center, whose
goal is to integrate sophisticated capabilities for early drug discovery, to contribute to a broader

including Biomarkers, Neuroimaging, Dementia Clinical Core, Neuropathology, Genetics and Data Science (or
simply BiNDiNGS) to students/trainees to provide leadership in training, career development, and dissemination
activities of the different Cores, thereby expanding current and future research by mentoring new scientists to
be well-prepared in this transdisciplinary area and poised to make important contributions. The REC will expand
current and future research by fostering new scientists from diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented
minorities (URMs), well-prepared in this transdisciplinary area, and who are poised to make important

10883656,"The incidence of tick-borne diseases has risen dramatically in the past two decades, and continues to rise.
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech) is one of the most prevalent, life-
threatening, emerging tick-borne zoonoses in the US. Ech is an obligatory intracellular bacterium of the order
Rickettsiales. Therapy of choice is the broad-spectrum antibiotic doxycycline, which is effective only if initiated
early. Currently there is no FDA-approved vaccine for Ech. Our long-term goal is to develop an evidence-
based vaccine approach to effectively protect humans by targeting multiple critical steps of the rickettsial
infection cycle. Toward this goal, we identified four Ech surface-exposed proteins that have known functions
required for Ech survival, and that also lack homology to human proteins, OMP-1/P28, Entry triggering protein
of Ehrlichia (EtpE), and VirB2. OMP-1/P28s are immunodominant surface-exposed outer membrane proteins
that have porin activity essential for bacterial nutrient acquisition. P28 and OMP-1B are predominantly
expressed in mammals and ticks, respectively. EtpE is an invasin that uses its C-terminus (EtpE-C) to bind the
host cell receptor to trigger Ech entry. We have shown that the type IV secretion system (T4SS) is essential for
Ech survival within the host cell. VirB2 is a T4SS pilus protein that is part of the T4SS machinery. Immunization
of mice with recombinant P28, EtpE, or VirB2 proteins generated Ech-specific antibody responses that
prevented Ech infection. These data support our premise that these proteins serve as rational vaccine
candidates for targeting non-overlapping processes in Ech infection of mammalian host cells. DNA vaccines
offer a number of potential advantages over traditional vaccines, including the stimulation of both humoral and
T-cell-mediated responses, improved vaccine stability, the absence of any infectious agent, and the relative
ease of packaging multi-components and large-scale manufacture. We showed the feasibility of an Ech DNA
vaccine in dogs by safely immunizing dogs with the DNA vaccines by percutaneous needle-free jet injection
and demonstrating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the DNA vaccines. Our hypothesis is
immunization with plasmid DNA vaccine encoding P28, OMP-1B, EtpE and VirB2 singly or in combination
prevents Ech transmission from ticks to mammals. To test this hypothesis, our Specific Aims are: 1. To
construct DNA vaccines encoding P28, OMP-1B, EtpE-C, and VirB2, determine the development of humoral
and cell-mediated immune responses in immunized mice, and evaluate protection of immunized mice from
infection with Ech cultured in tick cells. 2. To test if immunization of dogs with P28, OMP-1B, EtpE-C and VirB2
can prevent Ech transmission from infected ticks. The immediate outcomes of the proposed studies will be to
provide proof-of-principle for a DNA vaccine approach to the Ech vaccine candidates for blocking of Ech
transmission from ticks to dogs. The long-term outcome will be development of an anti-infective vaccine
against HME in humans that does not cause adverse effects."
10877013,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Maintenance of genome integrity is a fundamental function of all cellular life. Respiring
organisms maintain robust antioxidant systems to defend against pathologic reactive oxygen species (ROS)
which are a threat to genome integrity. ROS activates the DNA damage response (DDR) by virtue of several
types of DNA damage including crosslinks between RNA and DNA as well as induction of DNA double stranded
breaks (DSBs). The most common cancer therapeutic that mediates cell kill through induction of ROS is ionizing
radiation (IR). However, the mechanisms by which the DDR responds to ROS to maintain genome integrity are
not well understood. The PI, Neil Pfister, MD, PhD, identified ATP5A1 as a top hit in a genome-wide
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen using IR as the selective pressure. ATP5A1 is the alpha subunit of the soluble
F1 subunit of ATP synthase, the terminal electron transport chain complex that generates ATP in the presence
of an electrochemical proton gradient and molecular oxygen. A cleaved form of ATP5A1 was found to co-localize
to poly(ADP-ribose) and γH2AX foci, which is enhanced by oxidative stress and inhibited by PARP inhibition.
Cleaved ATP5A1 contains a poly(ADP-ribose) interaction domain that is required for poly(ADP-ribose) binding
and localization to DSBs. R-loop resolution proteins DHX9 and hnRNPU were identified as top protein
interactors, and depletion of ATP5A1, DHX9, or hnRNPU significantly increased levels of R-loops and
spontaneous DSBs. This project examines the central hypothesis that cleaved ATP5A1 cooperates with
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases to facilitate R-loop resolution and genome maintenance in response to oxidative
stress. To test this hypothesis, 3 specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will determine how cleaved ATP5A1
is regulated. Specific Aim 2 will delineate how cleaved ATP5A1 promotes genome maintenance through
interaction with DHX9, hnRNPU, and poly(ADP-ribose). Specific Aim 3 will dissect how cleaved ATP5A1 impacts
cell fate following oxidative stress. Dr. Pfister is mentored by Dr. David Yu and Dr. Kathy Griendling with
additional support from Dr. Francesca Storici, Dr. Xingming Deng, and Dr. William Dynan. Emory University
boasts an outstanding research environment at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center to complete
the proposed research. The goal of the K08 career development award is for Dr. Pfister to receive career
mentorship and training in genome maintenance and cell fate, ROS and oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial
biology, and R-loop biology, which complements his past training in order to investigate the role of cleaved
ATP5A1 in coordinating oxidative metabolism with genome maintenance, a topic of critical importance to cancer
initiation and cancer treatment. The proposed research, in combination with a structured mentoring and training
plan, is designed to facilitate Dr. Pfister's long-term goal to supervise an independently funded laboratory that
investigates how cells respond to IR and ROS in order to identify new opportunities for cancer therapy."
10808949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past three decades, substance use disorder (SUD) has emerged as a major public health
crisis. More than 70% of overdose deaths in the U.S. involve a synthetic opioid, which makes
successful treatment critical to those with SUD. However, the relapse rate is estimated at 40-60%,
and those with SUD are also at risk for long-term medical issues. Thus, SUDs are often chronic
conditions that require early and consistent engagement in treatment to achieve long-term
recovery. One effective method of engagement that health care systems have implemented is
matching recoverees with peer recovery coaches (PRCs) to help navigate them through
treatment. These at-elbow support coaches provide consistent, non-judgmental communication
and referral to various treatment and wraparound services, including medication assisted therapy
(MAT), which is considered the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. In this project,
we propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a novel technology tool: Peer PLUS (People
Leveraging Urgent Support). Peer PLUS is a standalone, HIPAA-compliant mobile app that
facilitates and tracks secure communication between PRCs and their clients, referrals to
community resources, and other recovery activities. The companion website allows a team of
PRCs to collectively manage a pool of clients, offering more comprehensive coverage. We expect
this point-of-care app to enhance communication between recoverees and their PRCs and
improve self-reported recovery outcomes. Additionally, Peer PLUS will provide a source of data
to help capture the care coordination efforts associated with peer coaching. Through our strategic
clinical trial and dissemination plan, we anticipate this intervention to be scaled for support of
recovery across different types of community partners with eventual extension to PRCs
supporting other types of mental health crises (e.g., post-suicide attempt). Implementation
science constructs infused with user-centered design strategies will be used to scaffold our Peer
PLUS evaluation and implementation toolkit development in the first phase of this project (R21),
which will provide a critical foundation for the randomized controlled trial and second site pilot
proposed in the second phase (R33). Because both the app and companion website are not tied
to any specific organization and the modular software is adaptable, this will be a low-cost, easily-
implementable option for any group that offers peer recovery support services."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, incurable form of non Hodgkin lymphoma which is disposed to
therapeutic resistance and relapse. Though rare, MCL is both clinically and genetically heterogenous and
represented by multiple subtypes. It is presently unknown how various genomic features impact the clinical
course of MCL and how these biological aspects contribute to treatment resistance and disease progression. It
is difficult to study the molecular features of MCL due to its rarity and lack of representation in accessible
databases like the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Additionally, it is currently challenging to integrate -omics
features in precision medicine initiatives due to the vast size of data from sequencing and unclear biological
and clinical relevance of singular mutational and transcriptional features. It is also difficult to study these
features in combination with demographic and other relevant individual features.
In the F99 phase of the proposed dissertation research project, Holly Hill will employ novel analytical and
computational methods to integrate multi-omics datasets in a pooled analysis of MCL patients. These analyses
will include genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and features of the clinical exposome. Feature selection
and variable reduction techniques will be used as appropriate. These sub-analyses will identify biological
correlates and generate composite variables which will be used in univariate and multivariate models to
examine clinical outcomes in MCL including drug response and survival.
The KOO phase of the proposed activities will include further investigations into MCL and other cancers utilizing
knowledge gained from the dissertation project (F99). Insights acquired during the F99 phase will also be used
to develop targeted assays that simplify the mutational or transcriptional profiles of MCL into clinically useful
and valid applications. Serial -omics measurements will be integrated into correlative genomics studies and
precision medicine trials which will include sequencing from liquid biopsies or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
The proposed efforts will produce insights into condensing and translating data from -omics studies into the
clinical space. It is hoped that the findings of this study will inform methods suitable for precision medicine trials
and help achieve our long-term objective to personalize therapeutics for individual cancer patients."
10870199,"ABSTRACT
The use of RNA technologies to specifically target genetic alterations in tumor cells has shown great potential of
becoming a novel therapy modality for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, systemic delivery of RNA agents such
as messenger RNA (mRNA) to tumor cells in vivo commonly faces multiple barriers, including low stability, rapid
elimination by renal excretion, insufficient cellular uptake, poor endosomal escape, and transient activities. Our
long-term objective is to develop robust nanoparticle (NP) platforms for effective and safe RNA delivery to solid
tumors, and along with cancer target validation in vivo, to eventually transition the RNA nanomedicines into
clinical development. In the last funding cycle, a lipid-polymer hybrid RNA NP system has been engineered with
favorable features, such as small size, high RNA encapsulation, efficient cytosolic translocation, and relatively
long blood circulation. We have also pioneered the application of these hybrid NPs for mRNA delivery to restore
tumor suppressors (e.g., PTEN) in different cancer types including prostate cancer (PCa) and non-small cell lung
cancer, which represents a novel approach to cancer treatment that is independent of oncogene antagonism. In
our latest work, we further reveal that PTEN restoration in PTEN-null/mutated murine tumor cell lines can induce
immunogenic cell death (ICD). Preliminary in vivo studies show that PTEN mRNA NP treatment triggers cytotoxic
T cell responses, modulates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and improves the responses of
immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In this renewal application, we propose to i) address the unique challenge
of transient bioactivity in mRNA delivery by developing a new generation of hybrid mRNA NPs, and ii) apply the
new hybrid mRNA NPs to explore PTEN restoration-induced ICD and evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of PTEN
restoration along with immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the three Aims underlying the proposal are: 1)
To optimize the new generation of hybrid NPs and study the NP-mediated long duration of mRNA bioactivity with
the goal of achieving prolonged PTEN expression in PCa tumors using as infrequent injections as possible; 2)
To apply the optimized mRNA NPs to investigate the mechanisms underlying PTEN-mediated ICD and anti-
tumor immune responses and to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety in subcutaneously grafted, orthotopic,
and transgenic models of PCa; and 3) To expand the new hybrid mRNA NPs to systemic co-delivery of PTEN
mRNA and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (a toll-like receptor-9 agonist) for stronger ICD and to test the co-delivery
NPs for PCa treatment together with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We expect that successful completion of this
project will lead to development of a novel synthetic mRNA nanotherapy that could benefit cancer patients with
loss/mutation of PTEN. Moreover, this NP delivery strategy could be readily expanded to other tumor suppressor-
encoding mRNAs for various malignancies."

In the U.S., 8.37 million adults over age 65 will experience a hospital stay during the next year, which often
has serious and long-lasting consequences including profound deterioration in physical function. Following a
hospital stay, around 1.35 million patients with deconditioning require rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility
(SNF) each year to address the deleterious musculoskeletal and functional deficits from deconditioning.
Unfortunately, current rehabilitation paradigms in SNFs do not adequately restore physical function, which
directly contributes to poor community discharge rates. Strikingly, only 52% of all patients admitted to SNFs
are discharged to a community setting (e.g., home), which suggests a paradigm shift is required to optimize
rehabilitation within SNFs. Currently, usual care rehabilitation in SNFs consists of low-intensity rehabilitation
interventions, which are physiologically inadequate to induce meaningful changes in skeletal muscle strength
and physical function. To address these pitfalls, a high-intensity resistance rehabilitation paradigm has been
shown to improve outcomes including better physical function, increased community discharge rates, and
cost-effective reductions in length of stay. The proposed pragmatic study seeks to apply this rehabilitation
paradigm to multiple SNFs to further evaluate the effectiveness of high-intensity resistance rehabilitation (Aim
1), while evaluating processes, mechanisms, and determinants of successful implementation (Aim 2). We
propose a cluster randomized pragmatic trial design in which a high-intensity intervention (15 SNFs) will be
compared to usual care (15 SNFs). Effectiveness in terms of physical function will be determined via change
in patient gait speed (primary outcome) from admission to discharge. Implementation strategies will be
evaluated by reach (proportion of patients treated with the intervention), adoption (proportion of therapists
appropriately adopting the intervention), implementation (fidelity assessments), and maintenance (long-term
fidelity assessments) of the intervention. This study will provide the first large-scale evaluation of high-
intensity rehabilitation for patients admitted to SNFs following hospitalization. Additionally, through systematic
comparison and in-depth analysis of implementation across a variety of SNFs, this study will provide critical
insight regarding barriers and facilitators of implementation. Overall findings from this study have the potential
to 1) shift SNF rehabilitation care paradigms; 2) optimize patient outcomes and independence and 3) critically
inform future work aimed at wide-scale implementation of high-intensity rehabilitation across post-acute
settings."

10884200,"Total knee replacement (TKR) utilization continues to increase, placing substantial burden on the
economy. As patients live longer with TKR, it is essential to identify strategies that will maximize long-term
functional outcomes and promote health-related quality of life and independence as adults age after surgery.
The majority of TKR patients meet criteria for overweight/obesity and remain physically inactive after surgery,
both of which heighten the risk of poor functional outcomes and disability. Further, most patients will actually
gain weight within two years after surgery. Patients after TKR are also at an increased risk of death from
cardiovascular and mental diseases. Promoting weight management may be an effective strategy to improve
long-term functional and physical activity outcomes after TKR, reduce the risk of disability and death from
cardiovascular and mental diseases, and improve the value of the costly surgery.
 We propose to examine the effectiveness of a Patient-Centered (PACE) weight loss program in adults
after TKR in a fully-powered, two-arm randomized controlled trial. Patients (n=250) will be randomized to
receive either (1) PACE weight loss program or (2) Chronic Disease Self-Management (CDSM) control group.
PACE participants will start the patient-centered program 12 weeks after TKR and continue for 12 months.
PACE is tailored to the patients’ needs and unique barriers to diet and physical activity. PACE focuses on
reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity (aerobic and resistance) to facilitate a weight loss of at
least 7% of initial body weight. Coaching calls with a trained behavioral interventionist will occur weekly during
months 1-4, biweekly during months 5-6, and monthly during months 7-12. No coaching will occur during the
maintenance phase (months 13-18). CDSM will receive a self-directed version of the program and monthly
calls on topics not related to study outcomes. Data collection will occur at baseline (12 weeks after surgery), 6
months (end of intensive intervention), 12 months (end of treatment), and 18 months (maintenance).
Assessments will include measures of weight, secondary outcomes (e.g., physical activity, pain, function), and
potential mediators from our conceptual model (e.g., adherence, self-efficacy, autonomy, competence). Data
related to the cost of implementing the PACE weight loss intervention relative to Control will also be collected
to examine the cost-effectiveness of reducing weight on patient outcomes. The primary outcome is weight
change at 6 months.
 The expected outcome from this study is to determine the effectiveness and long-term maintenance of
a refined patient-centered weight loss program tailored specifically for adults after TKR. If PACE is effective at
improving short- and long-term outcomes, and is found to be cost-effective, orthopedic centers and/or
insurance companies could consider offering this program to TKR patients, offering significant benefits to the
rising number of adults underdoing TKR."
10911914,"Deep learning (DL) based CT image formation methods have proliferated over the past few years. The
existing approaches mostly follow the paradigm established in computer vision, and build a deep neural
network (DNN) with standard modules that capture salient image features useful for computer vision tasks.
These standard modules also work very well for CT images, placing DL-based CT image formation methods at
the forefront of research and innovation. However, current DNNs are oblivious to the fact that CT images,
unlike natural images, must be interpretable by a radiologist to make a diagnosis. CT image interpretation is
affected by image features such as image resolution and noise variance-covariance, which are under exploited
by the standard modules from computer vision. Consequently, current DL-based CT image formation has no
direct characterization, let alone prospective control, of image resolution and noise variance-covariance. These
properties can only be assessed after an image is generated, but resolution/noise has no direct influence
during the image formation process. In this proposal, we challenge this established paradigm and propose an
innovative DL framework named GradDNN to (1) characterize the resolution and noise properties of a DNN’s
output during network training or parameter fine-tuning, and to (2) guide the image formation process so that
the output has the desired resolution/noise properties. GradDNN (which stands for gradient + DNN) applies
network linearization, i.e., gradient computation, to a mother DNN to extract local resolution and noise
properties of the images generated by the mother, and make these properties available during network training
and parameter fine tuning. The linearization method for analyzing nonlinear systems such as a DNN has never
been attempted before. Conceptually, GradDNN associates a daughter module to any mother DNN for
noise/resolution characterization, thereby making the resulting network CT-specific. We will develop GradDNN
and demonstrate its capability in the context of two important clinical tasks: (1) mitigation of calcium blooming
in coronary CT angiography, and (2) low contrast lesion detection in abdominal CT, both of which have high
requirements on resolution and noise. Data for DL network training will be generated using digitally augmented
patient data prospectively collected at two sites. Image quality comparison between the mother DNN alone and
the mother+daughter duo, using a number of effective mother DNN architectures, will be carried out to
demonstrate the additional gain of DL with joint resolution/noise learning. The comparison will use both digitally
augmented patient data and real patient data to further establish robustness and generalizability. In this
exploratory proposal, we focus on DL networks that perform image-to-image transformation. However, the
learning framework using GradDNN is general and can be applied to DL networks that perform direct
projection-to-image transformation. Successful completion of this proposal will generate strong preliminary
data for a follow-up R01 that extends our results to such DL networks."

The proposed research program aims to develop systems for the multiplex assessment of the effect of genetic
perturbation on the response of cells to exogenous and endogenous exposures at the resolution of individual
cells
. Specifically, we will develop a flexible and scalable in vitro platform for high-throughput single-cell gene-
by-environment interaction screens that couples CRISPR-based single-cell pooled genetic screens to a “nuclear
hashing”-based sample multiplexing strategy and a single-cell genomic readout. This platform will allow for the
simultaneous molecular description of 1,000s-10,000s of unique conditions (i.e. gene and exposure
combinations) at the resolution of individual cell types and cell states. In addition, we propose to develop a set
of tools based on heterologous viral receptor expression for the in situ and cell-type specific delivery of CRISPR-
based genetic perturbations in a manner compatible with single-cell RNA-seq. We highlight the versatility and
generalizability of our approach across three applications of our technologies that aim to define gene-by-
environment interactions in neurobiological disease. We propose to dissect the genetic interactions between
mutations associated with Alzheimer’s disease and the transcriptional response of neural cell types to oxidative
stress and peptide aggregates; to characterize the transcriptional effects associated with cell-type specific
modulation of genetic modifier activity in response to mutations in genes that cause epilepsy disorder and; to
determine how genes that are commonly mutated in brain cancer alter the response of murine tumors to
therapies in vivo. Our goal is to arrive at clinically actionable molecular descriptions of how individual genes
contribute to the response of individuals to exposure."
10811753,"Summary
Heart disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is directly related to the severity of coronary artery disease,
which results in impaired coronary blood flow and increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). T2DM patients are
2-4 times more likely to experience MI than non-diabetic patients. Although endothelial dysfunction and
atherosclerosis are known to decrease coronary blood flow (CBF) in T2DM, the underlying mechanisms are not
known. Adverse coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) remodeling is a critical mediator of T2DM-induced
cardiovascular disease. Published studies from the Trask lab show that structural remodeling of CRMs occurs
early in T2DM (db/db) mice and pigs with metabolic syndrome, leading to impaired CBF. While the mechanisms
that govern CRM remodeling are unclear, our preliminary data point to impaired Jagged1 (Jag1)/Notch signaling.
The Notch signaling pathway is known to facilitate communication between endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that expression of Jag1 and Notch3 in CRMs of T2DM (db/db) mice is
reduced, and that mice lacking EC-expressed Jag1, or Notch3-null mice had impaired CBF similar to T2DM
(db/db) mice. Furthermore, EC-Jag1-deficient mice have evidence of inward CRM remodeling. In addition, we
have shown a significant reduction in fenestrae in the of CRMs of diabetic mice and pigs, and in EC-Jag1-
deficient mice, suggesting that heterocellular EC-VSMC communication at the myoendothelial junction (MEJ)
maybe be disrupted in all models. Our recent studies identified Notch3 and Jag1 at the MEJ of normal CRMs.
Based upon our collective preliminary data, our overall hypothesis is that reduced coronary blood flow in T2DM
is driven by impaired Jag1/Notch signaling between ECs and VSMCs. We will test this hypothesis using an
integrative approach, combining genetically-deficient mouse models, EC-VSMC co-culture techniques, single-
cell transcriptomics, and transgenic/drug rescue experiments: The Specific Aims are: Aim1. Test the hypothesis
that T2DM causes a disruption of Jag1/Notch signaling in CRMs and define this mechanism. Aim 2. Determine
if aberrant Jag1/Notch signaling contributes to adverse coronary microvascular remodeling in T2DM using
genetic and transcriptomic approaches. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that activation of Jag1/Notch signaling can
prevent and/or treat T2DM-induced coronary microvascular remodeling. These studies will be the first to
demonstrate Notch signaling is central to CRM remodeling and impaired CBF, and that correction of this pathway
may reverse adverse CRM remodeling and reduced CBF in T2DM."
10901996,"Discogenic back pain, is a leading cause of disability, and involves degenerative changes of the
intervertebral disc (IVD), including structural defects that result in biomechanical instability and
inflammation. Since only a small subset of patients responds favorably to conventional treatments
which address the symptoms but not the disease, there is a need for regenerative therapies to
treat disc degeneration (DD). Treatment of DD with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation
can restore disc height and tissue architecture likely through paracrine signaling. The
degenerative IVD niche represents a harsh microenvironment for cell based repair, characterized
by changes in intradiscal dynamic hydrostatic pressure (HP), increased levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and accumulation of macrophages. While no consensus exists on the factors that
enhance treatment efficacy, studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory IVD milieu inhibits ECM
production. Our goal is to identify strategies to reduce the pro-inflammatory and enhance the anti-
inflammatory responses of bone marrow derived MSCs in IVD repair. Our hypothesis is that anti-
inflammatory macrophages and physiological dynamic mechanical loading augment MSC
immunomodulation and enhance IVD repair quality. In Aim 1, we will assess the contributions of
macrophage subpopulations and hydrostatic pressure on anti-inflammatory cross talk in IVD-
MSC-macrophage cultures. In Aim 2, we will investigate applied loading modulation as a strategy
to enhance MSC immunomodulation in an IVD compressive loading organ culture model. In Aim
3, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory cells in vivo. Successful
completion of this research will identify role of loading on immunomodulation by MSCs and
macrophages and establish the response of DD, a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, to cell
based repair that is optimized to enhance anti-inflammatory activity."

The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution seeks to implement tools, best practices and
analytical workflows for studying cancer evolution from cancer genome and transcriptome sequencing data.
Over the last 15 years, survey sequencing of patient populations of many cancer types has elucidated novel
driver mutations which are mechanistically responsible for disease pathogenesis. The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) and individual laboratory efforts have broadened the understanding of biological processes impacted by
somatic mutation and revealed new therapeutic targets that have achieved clinical impact. However, most of this
work has been based on bulk DNA sequencing from primary tumors and single biopsies from patients. It is well
understood that cancer is an evolutionary process during which clonal expansions within patients generates
heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cell populations across metastatic sites over time (with or without
therapeutic intervention). Indeed, the same targeted therapies developed based on mutation discoveries often
select for resistant clones, keeping durable cures out of reach. We will develop analytical methods, tools and
software infrastructure to study cancer progression through the lens of evolution, shifting emphasis from analysis
of primary tumors to dynamic analyses over clinical trajectories. We expect our program will advance the ability
to study clinical trajectories of patients in a more comprehensive approach, including temporal, spatial and single
cell analysis to better represent the full clonal repertoires of tumors and to study the determinants of how and
why tumors evolve. We use tools, well established in our laboratories, in three key areas: i) variant interpretation
from metastatic and post-treatment samples for discovery of therapeutic resistance mutations (Aim 1); ii) multi-
sample analysis across anatomic space, and/or time series data from serial biopsy or cell free DNA to track and
model clonal dynamics (Aim 2); iii) single cell approaches for clonal decomposition and clone-specific
phenotyping within patients (Aim 3). Our team is well positioned to carry out our objectives having developed
leading software infrastructures supporting TCGA and clinical sequencing through MSK-IMPACT, development
of clinically approved assays for longitudinal monitoring of patients through cell free DNA sequencing (MSK-
ACCESS) and through study of clonal evolution at bulk and single cell resolution. We will implement and improve
tools to support each of these aims, including Cancer Hotspots, OncoKB, and cBioPortal for Aim 1, PyClone
and fitClone for Aim 2 and CloneAlign and CellAssign for Aim 3, tailoring and customizing software to support
investigations into the dynamic and evolutionary nature of human cancers. These tools comprise a software
infrastructure focused on cancer evolution through variant allele interpretation, multi-sample analysis and single
cell investigation. Our infrastructure will enable researchers to automate evolutionary interpretation of disease
dynamics to better understand the clinical end points of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance."
10809386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, over 60,000 infants are born very preterm (VPT, ≤32 weeks’ gestation) each year; more
than 15% of these infants die in infancy, while ~20% survive with severe morbidity. Despite the sobering
statistics, not all preterm infants face these consequences. A crucial factor in determining outcomes is the
individual infant's response to any given therapy. However, our understanding of factors causing variation in
response, beyond immaturity itself, is limited and impedes our ability to customize therapies. The perinatal
period, is a critical time window when multiple changes and adaptations in the fetus/newborn set the foundation
for the future. Perinatal events could therefore be important determinants of variation in later life health and could
be used to identify therapeutically relevant phenotypes. Previous phenotyping efforts in preterm birth have either
based the categorization on the presentation leading to preterm delivery (aimed at prevention of preterm birth);
or used neonatal severity of illness markers (aimed at mortality prediction); or made prediction models for specific
complications (aimed at improving management of said morbidity). These approaches intentionally exclude
perinatal interventions such as delivery mode and perinatal antibiotics to minimize impact of practice variation.
However, maternal care practices are critical exposures that affect the infant’s response to interventions. Our
central hypothesis is that perinatal variables combining reason for birth with intrapartum care variables and
neonatal presentation can be used to categorize infants into finite ‘phenotypes’ early in life and can explain
variation in multiple later health outcomes. In aim 1, we will use a novel conceptual model to create perinatal
phenotypes by integrating the variables using clustering techniques. In aim 2 and 3, we will determine the
contribution of perinatal variables in explaining the variation of 2 key outcomes: timing and type of late-onset
infection and abnormal growth trajectory. In experimental models, both late-onset infection and weight gain are
causally linked with early-life colonization, which, in turn, is influenced by multiple perinatal factors. Thus,
perinatal factors, and any derived phenotypes from these factors, may explain the risk variation for these
outcomes. To perform this study, we will leverage a unique registry of over 3600 very preterm infants and their
mothers with manually adjudicated reason for birth and in-patient neonatal course, that we can link with
longitudinal pediatric records from birth to 5 years. The study team and PI have extensive experience in modeling
perinatal variables, creating linked datasets, clustering techniques and expertise the field of preterm birth and
neonatal infections. The expected result of our study is to create a much-needed and novel patient selection
framework for early life interventions, specifically those targeting early colonization, infection and inflammation.
If successful, such a framework could change the paradigm of how trials are designed and ultimately how clinical
care is customized."

Sulfur mustard (mustard gas) and arsenicals such as lewisite are major threats as chemical warfare or terrorist
agents. Despite different chemical structures, both types of agents lead to similar skin damage with large blisters
and wounds that heal slowly, raising the specter of shared pathogenic mechanisms. In this proposal, we will
investigate the role of oxidant skin injury as a shared mechanism in mustard and arsenical vesicant injury,
employing nitrogen mustard and phenylarsine oxide as surrogates for sulfur mustard and lewisite, respectively.
Although major advances have been made in vesicant research, we still do not have effective counter agents.
This may be in part due to lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis of vesicants. The overarching hypothesis
of this proposal is that defining the early effects of vesicants in vivo at subcellular and single cell levels will refine
our understanding of the role of oxidative stress in vesicant skin injury and lead to new therapeutic strategies.
We will also test the hypothesis that cobinamide, a highly effective and versatile antioxidant that neutralizes both
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, will be effective as a counter-agent and as means to understand better
the role of oxidative stress in nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced vesicant injury. The specific
aims are: 1) To understand the initiation of nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced skin injury
at a single cell level. We will use in vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and single cell RNA sequencing
to gain a new view on the initiation of vesicant injury and the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis. 2) To

vesicant skin injury in mice. Due to differences between mouse and human skin, we will also investigate vesicant

Sulfur mustard (mustard gas) and arsenicals such as lewisite are major threats as chemical warfare or terrorist
agents. Despite different chemical structures, both types of agents lead to similar skin damage with large blisters
and wounds that heal slowly, raising the specter of shared pathogenic mechanisms. In this proposal, we will
investigate the role of oxidant skin injury as a shared mechanism in mustard and arsenical vesicant injury,
employing nitrogen mustard and phenylarsine oxide as surrogates for sulfur mustard and lewisite, respectively.
Although major advances have been made in vesicant research, we still do not have effective counter agents.
This may be in part due to lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis of vesicants. The overarching hypothesis
of this proposal is that defining the early effects of vesicants in vivo at subcellular and single cell levels will refine
our understanding of the role of oxidative stress in vesicant skin injury and lead to new therapeutic strategies.
We will also test the hypothesis that cobinamide, a highly effective and versatile antioxidant that neutralizes both
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, will be effective as a counter-agent and as means to understand better
the role of oxidative stress in nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced vesicant injury. The specific
aims are: 1) To understand the initiation of nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced skin injury
at a single cell level. We will use in vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and single cell RNA sequencing
to gain a new view on the initiation of vesicant injury and the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis. 2) To
define the efficacy of cobinamide against nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced vesicant
skin injury. We will test the efficacy of cobinamide against nitrogen mustard- and phenylarsine oxide-induced
vesicant skin injury in mice. Due to differences between mouse and human skin, we will also investigate vesicant
mechanisms in transplanted human skin. These studies are significant and innovative because they use state of
the art tools to investigate a gap in our knowledge about the role of oxidative stress in the initiation of mustard

10880708,"The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) is especially high among individuals supervised by the criminal
justice system (CJS), and a preponderance of opioid overdose deaths occur among individuals who have a
history of CJS involvement (Binswanger et al., 2007; Bird et al., 2016). Because of the high prevalence of opioid
use among CJS populations, jails offer a unique opportunity to identify and treat persons with OUD. In 2017, the
FDA approved an extended-release formulation of buprenorphine (XR-B, Sublocade®; Indivior, Inc.) with
subcutaneous injections of 100mg or 300mg buprenorphine delivered every four weeks. Early evaluations of
XR-B in community setting show relatively high retention and positive opioid-use outcomes (Andorn et al., 2020;
Ling et al., 2020). Current practice for delivering extended-release medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD)
in jail settings is to detoxify the patient at admission, then provide an injection shortly before release (Vestal,
2018) with the targeted goal of reducing risk of relapse, overdose, and associated problems in the community.
This focus on the post-release phase is widespread. In fact, all of the jail-based MOUD studies we located in
literature searches for this proposal focused on initiating MOUD treatment shortly before jail/prison discharge
and tracking community-based outcomes following release (e.g., continued care, relapse, and recidivism; see
Moore et al., 2019). The ubiquitous focus on post-incarceration raises an important health-services question:
Could there be benefits of initiating XR-B treatment at the time of jail admission, relative to the standard approach
of detoxifying at admission, re-establishing opioid tolerance (with a week or more of administering oral
buprenorphine), and initiating XR-B shortly before discharge? To test this, we propose a 3-year, two-site,
randomized controlled trial in which new jail admissions (N=160) with OUD and sentences of < 6 months are
assigned to either begin XR-B treatment immediately (experimental group) or 3-4 weeks prior to discharge
(treatment as usual; TAU), including a lead-in sublingual Suboxone phase of 1-2 weeks. To assess the potential
effects of in-jail XR-B maintenance, all study participants will be enrolled at jail admission and assessed monthly
over their incarceration term. In-jail assessments include psychological distress (Kessler 6), opioid craving
(VAS), and administrative records of in-jail behavioral infractions (administrative, serious, and related to
diversion). Our inclusion of in-jail outcomes will allow us to have monthly (pre-release) follow-up data for nearly
100% of the sample, overcoming the common problem of missing data in CJS studies of MOUD. Post-release
outcomes will be assessed 1 & 3 months following release from jail, and include XR-B continuation in the
community (Sublocade is on the Medicaid formulary in Massachusetts), patient-centered perceived progress in
recovery (TEA), opioid use (ASI, urine toxicology), and psychological distress (K-6). Six-month recidivism will be
assessed through county records, though recidivism is not a focus of this project. Indivior has agreed to provide
Sublocade for the study participants in both study conditions."

There is a lack of population-based longitudinal studies of alcohol misuse trajectories and related negative

studies examining risk and protective factors for alcohol misuse among sexual minorities have largely focused
on individual-level factors and neglected factors at the social and policy level. There is a need to expand this

Tobacco and Health study (n=45,971; 2013-2021). This study design will allow us to explore changes in
alcohol misuse based on sexual orientation before and after COVID-19 onset. Our study aims to: (1) Identify
alcohol misuse trajectories over an 8-year period and determine if these associations differ by sexual
orientation (a) concordance vs. discordance, and (b) stability vs. fluidity. We will also examine potential
heterogeneity in risk by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and gender identity and compare changes in alcohol misuse
before and after COVID-19 onset by sexual orientation. (2) Examine (a) how variation in alcohol misuse
trajectories shape negative health-related consequences (e.g., AUD symptoms, other substance use disorder
symptoms, polysubstance use, and negative physical health consequences) and (b) whether this differs across
sexual orientation subgroups, by sexual orientation discordance vs. concordance, and sexual identity fluidity

10853022,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Left heart disease (LHD) leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH-LHD, aka Group 2 PH), right ventricular (RV)
failure, and increased mortality and morbidity. Advances in pulmonary vascular biology gleaned from study of
the pulmonary arterial (PA) circulation in Group 1 PH and relevant animal models have led to effective therapies
for Group 1 PH. Trials of Group 1 PH therapies in PH-LHD have shown highly variable (favorable, neutral or
harmful) effects. We propose that two critical knowledge gaps contribute to variability in therapeutic response
and impede progress in treating PH-LHD: (1) the lack of a mechanistically informative hemodynamic
classification system defining the nature (vasoconstriction vs remodeling) and location (PA vs pulmonary venous
(PV)) of pulmonary vascular disease in LHD, and (2) lack of understanding of vessel specific (PV vs PA)
biological pathways mediating pulmonary vascular disease in PH-LHD. The objective of this proposal is to
address these knowledge gaps and enable therapeutic innovation in PH-LHD. Based on extensive preliminary
studies in human and experimental (Exp) PH-LHD, our central hypothesis is that PH-LHD is a phenotypically
diverse entity whose ultimate therapeutic approach will be defined by unique hemodynamic phenogroups and
vessel specific (PA vs PV) pathophysiological perturbations. In human and Exp PH-LHD, we will use novel
hemodynamic assessments to phenotype PH-LHD according to pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR),
vasoreactivity, and the longitudinal distribution of PVR (Aim 1). Findings will be validated in human PH-LHD by
assessing phenogroup-specific differences in aerobic capacity, RV reserve function and exertional lung
congestion. Findings in Exp PH-LHD will be validated by defining PA and PV remodeling (quantitative
histomorphometry). Our broad hypothesis is that both the primary mechanism and location of the elevated PVR
in PH-LHD have clinical implications and anatomical underpinnings. In human and Exp PH-LHD, we will then
(Aim 2) use histochemical, proteomic, and transcriptomic based techniques and bioinformatic analyses to define
vessel specific mechanisms across PH-LHD phenogroups. These studies will couple the Aim 1 hemodynamic
phenotyping approach to vessel specific vascular biology. In Aim 3, we will determine if therapeutic agents based
on our omics studies in human and Exp PH-LHD will ameliorate PV or PA remodeling and delay the progression
of PH in Early or Late Exp PH-LHD phenogroups. The research outcome from this work will be a new
hemodynamic classification of PH-LHD linked to specific pathophysiology and therapeutic targets, thus enabling
individualized medicine approaches to PH-LHD."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of

This K76 Career Development award will address the large unmet need for patient-specific decision support
tools for surgical interventions in older adults and provide a platform for the applicant to become a leader in
geriatric surgery. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder in older adults that is
associated with serious long-term morbidity, including osteoporotic fractures, kidney stones, and chronic
kidney disease (CKD). Parathyroidectomy can prevent these morbid sequelae. However, increased surgical
risk associated with advanced age and frailty, in addition to the competing risk of death prior to achieving
benefit from surgical intervention, raises the question of whether the short-term risks of parathyroidectomy
outweigh long-term risk reduction in this group. Identifying older adults likely to benefit from surgical
interventions, such as parathyroidectomy, while preventing overuse of surgery in this vulnerable group, is
critical to improve patient-centered care. Currently, there is no standardized methodology for developing
surgical decision support for older adults that incorporates individualized risk prediction and stakeholder input
to facilitate informed, patient-centered decision-making. Therefore, this coordinated research and training
proposal aims to: 1) compare the effects of parathyroidectomy vs. medical management on the incidence of
fractures, symptomatic kidney stones, and CKD in older adults with PHPT; 2) develop and validate predictive
models for the perioperative risks of parathyroidectomy and long-term risks of fractures, kidney stones, and
CKD specific to older adults with PHPT; and 3) design and test with stakeholder feedback a PHPT decision
support tool that describes the tradeoffs of parathyroidectomy vs. non-operative management. To accomplish
these aims, Dr. Seib will obtain training in comparative effectiveness and predictive modeling, qualitative and
mixed methods research to develop decision support, and implementation science. Upon completion of this
research, Dr. Seib will have a user-tested risk/benefit calculator that will form the basis of a decision support
tool to improve individualized, patient-centered treatment recommendations for older adults with PHPT. In
addition, this research will establish a framework for developing patient-centered decision support that can be
applied to other conditions to promote appropriate surgical management of older adults. This proposal is
significant because it directly addresses the gap in decision support tools for PHPT and other surgically
managed conditions in older adults. This project is innovative because it proposes a paradigm shift to
incorporate geriatric principles to individualize treatment decisions in older adults with PHPT to optimize clinical
outcomes. At the end of the proposed research, Dr. Seib will have the data and skills necessary to successfully
pursue R01 funding for a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to test this decision support tool and
apply this methodology to other conditions with surgical treatment options that affect older adults."

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in U.S. and worldwide. Post-stroke cognitive impairment
(PSCI), a common sequela after stroke, is a decisive determinant of the quality of life for stroke survivors.
Clinical studies have indicated that PSCI is common in both young and old stroke patients, even in cases
of relative mild stroke and victims with successful thrombolysis and endovascular reperfusion therapies.
However, the underlying mechanisms of PSCI remains poorly understood and no FDA approved treatment
is available for PSCI. In this application, we propose to investigate the roles and therapeutic potential of
DKK3 in PSCI and the underlying mechanisms using an experimental stroke model of transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. Previous studies (including ours) have
demonstrated that mice subjected to transient MCAO developed long-term cognitive deficits that correlate
with secondary damage to the hippocampus. Based on our promising pilot data, we hypothesize that DKK3
plays an important role not only in acute brain damage but also in secondary hippocampal damage and
thereby represents a novel promising therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairment after ischemic
stroke. First, we will determine the tempo-spatial regulation of DKK3 (and miR-125a) expression in the
normal and ischemic brains at different time points after stroke, and evaluate the efficacy of early treatment
versus delayed treatment by intranasal administration of recombinant DKK3 protein to ameliorate acute
stroke injury and to improve long-term neurologic and cognitive outcomes after ischemic stroke (Aim1).
Next, we will determine the mechanistic roles of DKK3 in neuropathology with the focus on the hippocampal
mechanisms of PSCI after ischemic stroke (Aim 2). To test this hypothesis, the loss-of-function and gain-
of-function experiments will be performed, in which conventional and conditional DKK3 knockout mice and
functional reconstitution study with recombinant DKK3 via intranasal drug delivery will be utilized. Based
on pilot data, we further hypothesize that ischemic stroke induces increase of miR-125a expression hence
down-regulates DKK3 expression in the hippocampus, which contributes to PSCI induced by transient
MCAO (Aim 3). We will determine the DKK3-dependent effects of miR-125a inhibition to improve PSCI
after ischemic stroke. Both young adult and aged mice will be studied. The proposed studies may reveal
previously unappreciated mechanisms underlying PSCI and provide a novel therapeutic approach to
improve neurologic and cognitive outcomes following ischemic stroke."

 Once an RNA is transcribed in the nucleus, it is bound by RNA binding proteins and
other regulatory RNAs which control its sequence (by altering splicing), half-life (by modulating
RNA stability and decay) and translation (through mediation of ribosome initiation and
elongation) among other RNA processing steps. Individual RBP binding sites can have
significant physiological importance, as emphasized by the recent example of the drug
Spinraza, which is an antisense oligonucleotide that blocks a single RBP:RNA interaction in
order to cure Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Recent advances in genomics techniques have
dramatically increased our ability to identify the interaction sites for these regulatory RBPs and
RNAs, and we now have catalogs of over a million such interaction sites that are candidate RNA
regulatory elements. However, it is clear that only a small fraction of these elements truly
function as regulatory modules, as few show differences in RNA processing when the RBP is
knocked down or otherwise altered. As such, large-scale assays to sift through these elements
to identify the subset that are function are an essential missing piece in converting these
element databases into a useful tool for researchers interested in understanding whether human
genetic variation will alter RNA biology.
In this proposal, I describe my research group’s proposed efforts to address this major
knowledge gap in two areas:
 1. Using orthogonal approaches (rapid degradation of RBPs followed by genomics
 profiling to identify direct regulatory targets of RBPs and massively parallel reporter
 assays) to characterize which RBP binding sites confer regulation.
 2. Large-scale identification of regulatory targets for snoRNAs, snRNAs, and other
 regulatory RNAs through improved genomics techniques.
My extensive expertise in developing experimental and computational genomics methods to
map and understand RNA processing regulatory networks makes my newly founded lab an
ideal location to undertake these efforts, and build an improved global picture of the RNA
processing regulatory landscape. Further, it will support my efforts to develop an independent
research group that will lay the foundation to the broader effort to understand how human
genetic variation affects disease through mis-regulation of RNA processing."

 Since its discovery about five decades ago, cisplatin has been proven to be one of the most effective
treatments for a variety of cancers and is still a widely used chemotherapy drug subscribed to 10-20% of the
cancer patients. Along with its potent anti-cancer efficacy, well recognized is the toxic side effects associated
with cisplatin/platinum-based chemotherapy. Cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity, as known since its early clinical
trials, is not only prevalent but also severe with long lasting adverse effects. Acute kidney injury has been
observed in 30% of cancer patients receiving a single dose of cisplatin chemotherapy and in 50-70% of patients
receiving multiple doses. Besides disrupting effective anti-cancer treatment, cisplatin induced acute kidney injury
affects those patients even after switching to other anticancer regimens. They still face increased risks of chronic
kidney injury, poor prognosis, and higher mortality. Therefore, it is essential to address this unmet medical need
by developing effective preventions and interventions to mitigate cisplatin induced acute kidney injury. In the
kidney, cisplatin causes both vascular and proximal tubule damages through molecular events of elevated
oxidative stress, inflammation, excessive wastes accumulation in cytoplasm, and apoptosis. Our preliminary
results demonstrated that rapamycin perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticles simultaneously enhance autophagy
to facilitate clearance of wastes in cytoplasm and inhibit inflammation through mTOR-NF-κB signaling. With the
rapamycin PFC nanoparticles treatment, renal function is protected, and survival rate is significantly improved in
the mice receiving cisplatin. Moreover, rapamycin PFC nanoparticles have favorable pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution. Comparing to free rapamycin, rapamycin PFC nanoparticles significantly reduced systemic
exposure of rapamycin and its accumulation in the vital organs, such as brain. Accordingly, in this proposed
study, our central hypothesis is that cisplatin induced acute kidney injury could be mitigated by preserving renal
vasculature and proximal tubule through simultaneously inhibition of inflammation and enhancement of
autophagy via mTOR-NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, following three specific aims are proposed to test the
hypothesis for potential clinical translation. Specific Aim 1 will further validate the therapeutic efficacy of
rapamycin PFC nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo with regard to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
therapy with regard to mTOR-NF-κB signaling pathway; Specific Aim 2 will evaluate integrated 19F and 1H BOLD
MRI for non-invasive therapeutic evaluation of cisplatin induced AKI by simultaneously quantifying renal vascular
injury and hypoxia. In Specific Aim 3, we will rigorously examine the safety of rapamycin PFC nanoparticles,
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, clearance, and biodistribution in both control and tumor-bearing mice for
clinical translation. Also, the effect of rapamycin PFC nanoparticles on tumor growth will be investigated."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication experienced by roughly 20% of adult patients during
hospitalization. AKI is associated with long-term adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease and
death, as well as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although serum creatinine may improve or normalize after an
episode of AKI, the biological processes of injury, repair, and fibrosis may continue for months afterwards; thus
during this time period, interventions can be implemented to improve long-term outcomes. Indeed, early post-
discharge follow-up with a nephrologist after severe AKI has been associated with a 25% reduction in mortality
in pilot trials. The overall objective of this multicenter clinical trial is to definitively evaluate the impact of
systematic post-discharge nephrology follow-up among patients with in-hospital AKI in a dedicated transitional
care clinic after acute kidney injury (TCC-AKI) and compare it with the standard of care. The rationale is that
the first few months after hospital discharge represent a critical window of time in which medical interventions
may have a significant impact on long-term kidney outcomes. This intervention will consist of telemedicine or
in-person visits in which nephrologists will address several key domains of patient care that can influence long-
term clinical outcomes, including blood pressure management, medication reconciliation, cardiovascular health
assessment, and patient counseling. We will emphasize appropriate care management targets for several
comorbid risk factors. The overarching hypothesis is that timely longitudinal follow-up at the TCC-AKI post-
discharge in patients with KDIGO Stages 2 and 3 AKI will result in improved intermediate and long-term clinical
outcomes compared to usual care, with better patient-reported outcomes as well. The overall objective will be
achieved by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) to recruit patients with KDIGO stages 2 and 3 AKI during
hospitalization to a randomized clinical trial of post-discharge AKI follow-up; 2) to ascertain intermediate
outcomes in patients receiving post-discharge AKI follow-up compared to those receiving usual care; and 3) to
ascertain long-term outcomes of post-discharge AKI follow-up compared to those receiving usual care. Under
Aim 1, patients will be recruited into this study for randomization to systematic AKI follow-up in a TCC-AKI.
Under Aim 2, intermediate outcomes, including recurrent AKI and hospitalizations will be evaluated. Under Aim
3, long-term outcomes including CKD incidence, CKD progression, and mortality will be assessed. The
research proposed here is innovative for its multidisciplinary approach, use of cutting-edge techniques,
integration of telemedicine for clinical use, and development of a systematic approach to post-discharge AKI
follow-up. This work will be significant because rigorously conducted randomized studies and translational

10909056,"Project summary
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and debilitating complication in hospitalized patients; however, AKI survivors after
hospital discharge often receive fragmented health care. This increases the likelihood for the development of long-term
major adverse kidney events (MAKE), defined as incident or progressive chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease
and all-cause mortality. Patients who experience severe AKI (stages 2 and 3 per the KDIGO classification) are at even
higher risk for poor outcomes including MAKE, due to higher propensity for persistent damage manifested as lower renal
function and proteinuria. In addition, AKI survivors report poor quality of life and exhibit frailty for at least a year after the
AKI incident. To overcome the gaps in severe AKI management, we hypothesize that screening and intensive monitoring
and management of blood pressure and proteinuria via renin-angiotensin system blockade and volume optimization
(following KDIGO guidelines) reduces the rate of MAKE within 2 years, improves patient-reported outcomes, and reduces
healthcare costs. Thus, Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth System have developed the Cleveland COPE-AKI Clinical Center
trial to compare the usual standard of care with an intensive, managed care pathway, called Champion Care Pathway. The
Champion Care Pathway team will comprise a virtual/remote nurse-navigator under the supervision of a nephrologist and
supported by a Patient Advisory Council. The structured longitudinal outpatient care pathway will be facilitated by multi-level
remote patient monitoring, targeting the risk factors for MAKE in AKI stages 2 and 3 survivors. Patients enrolled to the
Champion Care Pathway arm will be empowered to be active participants in their health management by providing their
own blood pressure, weight, kidney function, and albuminuria data for the first three months after their hospital discharge
and at predefined time intervals thereafter for 2 years post discharge. This data will allow the Champion Care team to
mitigate changing health status episodes in an outpatient setting. The planned adaptive trial design will allow the focus of
the intervention to be directed toward the patients most at risk for post-discharge kidney-specific incidents. Thus, the specific
aims of the Cleveland COPE-AKI Clinical Center are to determine the impact of the Champion Care Pathway on 1) time to
MAKE by 2 years 2) patient-reported outcomes and 3) cost effectiveness. Analyses will determine whether long-term
continuity of care reduces morbidity and mortality for AKI stages 2 and 3 patients, reduces healthcare costs and improves
the well-being of long-term AKI stages 2 and 3 survivors. In addition, the Cleveland COPE-AKI Clinical Center will work
collaboratively and closely with the scientific data and research center along with other participating clinical centers to
develop common policies and protocols designed for study interventions and periodic biospecimen sampling for contribution
to the entire COPE-AKI consortium."

This application is the competitive renewal of the “Immunobiology of Rheumatic Diseases”
Training Program at Washington University School of Medicine. The program, which was
initiated in 1977 by Dr. John Atkinson, has a strong record of training postdoctoral fellows who
are committed to careers in rheumatic disease research. The goal of the training program is to
develop independent scientist who will ultimately work to improve outcomes of patients suffering
from rheumatic diseases. The current application, which seeks support for five MD, MD/PhD, or
PhD postdoctoral trainees per year, incorporates a number of new programmatic features to
enhance this training mission. The Program accepts trainees from an expanded pool of
outstanding applicants and benefits from close relationships to the Physician Scientist Training
Programs in both Medicine and Pediatrics, the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences,
and the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences. New to this competitive renewal is the
offering of a clinical/translational research track which complements our basic science research
track. Trainees will benefit from extensive didactic offerings leading to a Master of Science in
Clinical Investigation degree. The centerpiece of either track remains an intense mentored
research experience. Trainees are mentored by a committed primary faculty mentor, in
collaboration with their scholarship oversight committee. The talented group of 35 well-funded
faculty mentors are organized into four thematic areas- Immune Regulation and Host Defense,
Animal Models of Rheumatic Disease, Clinical/Translational Research, and Omics. These

This ambitious proposal will establish an integrated experimental-computational platform to create the first
comprehensive brain-wide mesoscale connectivity map in a non-human primate, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus),. It will do so by tracing axonal projections of RNA barcode-identified neurons brain-wide in
the marmoset, utilizing a sequencing-based imaging method that also permits simultaneous transcriptomic cell
typing of the identified neurons. This will help bridge the gap between brain-wide mesoscale connectivity data
available for the mouse from a decade of mapping efforts using modern techniques and the absence of
comparable data in humans and NHP.
The proposal will bring together new viral barcode-based approaches with established tracer-injection based
methods to collect an unprecedented data set which will permit comprehensive mapping of region-to-region
axonal projections in the marmoset brain with cell-type specificity, apply this data to scientific questions regarding
how brain connectivity differs between primates and rodents, address the relation between MRI-derived
measures to ground-truth connectivity, and utilize web-based tools to engage the research community in
annotating and using the resulting data. A diverse team of world-leading experts and pioneers in the problem
domain who are already collaborating, spanning diverse institutions and disciplines, and equipped with
outstanding facilities and resources, will come together to assemble the enabling platform. There are five specific
aims to achieve stated goals. Aim 1 is to establish data acquisition platform for mesoscale projection mapping
in marmoset using barcoded + fluorescent AAV/AAV-retro. Aim 2 is to develop brain-wide single-axon projection
maps using systemic injections with simultaneous transcriptomic cell-typing. Aim 3 is to develop data
management and analysis pipelines. Aim 4 is to perform comparative studies of the mesoscale connectivity in
marmoset and mouse, comparing MRI-based connectivity with ground truth. Aim 5 is to develop platforms for
data dissemination, community engagement through web portal, collaborative proofreading and annotations.
Such a data set will have profound scientific significance, comparable to the first whole genome map of a primate.
As genomes encode the blueprint for understanding an organism’s phenotype, so does the architecture of brain
circuitry contain the blueprint for explaining an animal’s behavior and holds the key to many open questions."

Nervous system disease may yield devastating impact on cognition, emotion, or sensorimotor function. Gene
delivery using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has demonstrated immense potential for treatment of
congenital and acquired diseases impacting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Advancing
mechanistic understanding of vector uptake and trafficking within nervous system cells would inform viral
vector capsid design. Heretofore, visualizing viral vector cellular transduction in vivo has been hampered by a
lack of optimal means for resolving nanoscale particles in thick tissues. Imaging viral particles whose
dimensions are below the ~250 nm diffraction limit resolution of light microscopy is typically achieved using
electron microscopy, a resource-intensive technique incompatible with life. There is a critical need to develop
intravital imaging techniques that enable high-speed and deep nanoscale imaging of living systems. Two-
photon excitation (2PE) microscopy is a powerful technique for intravital imaging of the nervous system that
employs ultrafast near-infrared laser light capable of penetrating deep into tissues. Though the technique
enables intravital imaging of thick tissues, the achievable resolution and image quality of 2PE microscopy is
inadequate for study of nanoscale processes. 2PE microscopy may be paired with stimulated emission
depletion (STED) techniques to enable resolution of nanoscale fluorescent-tagged targets. To enhance
imaging depth and signal-to-background, 2PE may be achieved via spatiotemporal overlap of two ultrafast
lasers of different wavelengths in a process termed non-degenerate 2PE. Heretofore, wide dissemination of
2PE-STED and non-degenerate 2PE microscopy techniques have been hampered by the cost and complexity
associated with synchronization and alignment of two ultrafast laser sources. Herein, we propose to develop
efficient super-resolved multiphoton microscopy approaches to enhance spatiotemporal resolution and imaging
depth within living tissues by employing a single dual-output commercial ultrafast laser. Once developed, we
will employ these novel imaging platforms to study intracellular trafficking of single AAV particles within cells of
the murine nervous system. In Aim 1, the dual-output ultrafast laser will be utilized to achieve 2PE-STED
microscopy via pulsed depletion and employed to image AAV trafficking in cultured Schwann cells and primary
sensory neurons of murine dorsal root ganglia. In Aim 2, the dual-output ultrafast laser will be utilized to
achieve non-degenerate 2PE and paired with a continuous wave depletion beam for deep super-resolution
imaging of AAV trafficking in corneal Schwann cells and sensory neurons in live anesthetized mice. A liquid
lens will be employed to enhance volumetric imaging speed. If successful, this work carries potential to
advance understanding of viral vector transduction of nervous system cells by identifying intracellular trafficking
bottlenecks, while illustrating the potential of super-resolution 2PE microscopy techniques to advance
knowledge discovery in biomedicine."

The most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in brain, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), is inactivated by two
enzymes: monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and α/β hydrolase domain-contain 6 (ABHD6) that differ in their
hydrolyzing activities and subcellular localization (presynaptic and postsynaptic, respectively). Accordingly,
selective inhibition of each enzyme results in different spatiotemporal enhancement of 2-AG-CB1R signaling in
the brain, and potentially synergistic therapeutic benefits.
 We recently gathered results showing that stimulated increase in 2-AG production is reliably measured using
GRABeCB2.0, a recently developed 2-AG sensor. Remarkably, metabotropic receptor mediated increase in 2-AG
is controlled by ABHD6, whereas ionotropic receptor-dependent increase in 2-AG is not controlled by ABHD6.
These results raise the question of how MAGL controls stimulation-dependent 2-AG production?
 Demonstrating that receptor-dependent increases in 2-AG production and activity at CB1R signaling are
differentially controlled by ABHD6 and MAGL would provide an additional level of mechanistic distinction
between these eCB-hydrolyzing enzymes. To increase our understanding of the respective roles of ABHD6 and
MAGL in controlling 2-AG-CB1R signaling in brain, we initiated an effort and have now successfully validated the
GRABeCB2.0 pharmacological profile in neural cells in culture and identified several stimuli that increase 2-AG
production. Based on this premise, we propose to address the following two questions in mouse neurons in
primary culture and striatal slices using live-cell fluorescence microscopy, two-photon microscopy and
electrophysiology:
Aim 1: Which stimuli increase 2-AG production and GRABeCB2.0 signal in neurons?
Aim 2: How do ABHD6 and MAGL differentially control stimuli-dependent increases in 2-AG-CB1R
signaling in neurons?
Completion of the work outlined in this new R21 grant proposal will provide a comprehensive understanding of
the respective role of ABHD6 and MAGL in controlling 2-AG-CB1R signaling in the brain. Our long-term goal is
to increase our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and system’s level differences by which ABHD6 and
MAGL control eCB signaling in brain, a body of work that will help develop novel therapeutics with reduced
potential for abuse and adverse effects produced by classic cannabinoid agonists."

American children are exposed to violence at a shockingly high rate. Over one in eight have had
the maltreatment they experienced confirmed by the authorities, and at least one in four have
witnessed inter-parental violence. Although formal institutions such as social service providers,
child welfare, and law enforcement agencies are intended to protect families, these institutions
may be seen less as family protectors than as agents of surveillance, punishment, and family
separation—especially in vulnerable communities. The overall goal of this research is to
understand how contact with formal institutions shapes family violence experiences and
their consequences for children. It will also allow the principal investigator, Dr. Tasseli
McKay, the opportunity to build the measurement expertise, analytic skills, and methodological
tools needed to conduct impactful, long-term research on the implications of mass incarceration
for family violence. The project consists of five studies, combining primary qualitative
interviews and mobile surveys with youth and parents in contact with punitive
institutions (such as juvenile and criminal legal systems) and secondary analysis of
survey and administrative data. It will generate (1) Estimates of the bidirectional relationship
between institutional contact and childhood family violence exposure (Aim 1, K99 phase); (2)
New, validated measures of institutional contact that capture objective institutional contacts and
subjective experiences of institutional responsiveness (Aim 2, K99 phase); (3) A qualitative
assessment of how institutional contacts and institutional responsiveness inform family violence
disclosure decisions among affected family members (Aim 3, R00 phase); (4) Estimates of the
influence of institutional contact events and institutional responsiveness on help-seeking
intentions and service utilization (Aim 4, R00 phase); and (5) A quantitative assessment of the
respective roles of institutional contact events and institutional responsiveness in shaping the
relationship between childhood exposure to family violence and involvement in violence during
the transition to adulthood (Aim 5, R00 phase). The project will produce advances in
conceptualization, measurement, and analytic methods that lay a foundation for new research
on institutional contact as a social determinant of child health and well-being and help
inform sound public policy and public health intervention for the most common and
impactful forms of violence: those within the family."

Physical activity (PA) is a cornerstone of human health and well-being; however, its implementation as a viable
treatment and preventative option for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) remains understudied. This is underscored
at the social level by the ~26% of adult U.S. citizens that report binge drinking and the mere 3% of citizens who
manage to meet daily U.S. PA guidelines. The NIAAA recognizes the importance of understanding and
promoting the use of PA for treating AUDs. The effects of voluntary PA on preclinical measures of excessive
alcohol intake are mixed. We seek to better evaluate this relationship by addressing the role of voluntary PA in
reducing binge-like ethanol drinking in a unique genetic risk model of drinking to intoxication, the High Drinking
in the Dark (HDID-1) mouse line (Aim 1). Understanding and defining key stages of PA development and
reinforcement may be important for determining its potential as an AUD treatment option. Chronic PA and
alcohol use create neural remodeling across interconnected brain regions belonging to the mesocorticolimbic
system. This neural network comprises of interoceptive brain regions – those responsible for the processing
and translating the internal body state [such as the insula cortex (IC)] - aversion-related brain regions [such as
the basolateral amygdala (BLA)] and brain regions important for reinforcement [i.e., the ventral tegmental area
(VTA)]. Here, we plan to retrogradely trace the nucleus accumbens (NAc) - the central point of convergence for
this system – and determine which neural inputs are engaged at 2- and 4-weeks of wheel-running. Prior wheel-
running work has characterized cFos using slice-based immunohistochemistry, but only in male rodents.
Considering stark sex differences in PA in humans and rodents, this application addresses a major gap in the
literature. cFos immunoreactivity (IR) will be used in combination with a retrograde tracer (rAAV2-retro-GFP) to
reliably characterize and trace the neural inputs to the NAc. We hypothesize that distinct aversion-related NAc
projections (e.g. extended amygdala) will be engaged during acute wheel-running and that regions important
for interoception and reinforcement (such as the IC and NAc) will be engaged following chronic PA. The IC
relays relevant interoceptive information to limbic regions, such as the NAc, and influences motivated
behaviors (like PA and alcohol use). Chemogenetically silencing the IC  NAc circuit has been shown to
increase interoceptive effects of alcohol in rats. To determine the importance of the IC in the reinforcement of
PA, we will test whether chemogenetically silencing or activating the IC  NAc circuit [using designer
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)] will modulate voluntary PA at acute and chronic
timepoints. We hypothesize that chemogenetically silencing the IC  NAc projection will increase acute PA
(associated with aversion) and reduce chronic PA (associated with reward). In contrast, we hypothesize that
chemogenetically activating the IC  NAc projection will decrease acute PA and increase chronic PA. To
compliment prior alcohol work, we will to determine the importance of this circuit in PA."

The objective of this research proposal project is to identify modifiable factors associated with different
postoperative respiratory failure (PRF) phenotypes in adults following elective surgery and to utilize this
information to develop and deploy a predictive model and electronic health record-based probability scoring
system and dashboard for PRF. PRF, defined as the prolonged inability to wean from mechanical ventilation or
inadequate oxygenation and/or ventilation, has an incidence of up to 7.5% and has been associated with a
risk-adjusted $53,000 increase in hospital charges, 9 extra days of hospitalization, and a 22% increase
in-hospital mortality. With the number of elective surgical procedures increasing annually, there is an urgent
and unmet need to reduce the incidence and burden of this potentially preventable event by elucidating risk,
preventive, and therapeutic factors. These factors, some of which may be modifiable, may differ between
phenotypic presentations. AIM 1: To optimize and validate an automated, EHR-based, clinical prediction model
for PRF. We will automate data collection and model the contributions of pre-and intra-operative factors on full
model discrimination and calibration. Hypotheses: (H1.1) It is possible to automate data curation. (H1.2) A
model including data from 2014-2021 and quantitative risk indices will outperform our previous model that used
data from 2012-2015. AIM 2: To identify unique PRF phenotypes using clinical and biochemical markers that
are readily available in the postoperative phase and determine if these markers predict PRF within 48 hours.
Hypotheses: (H2.1) Readily available clinical and biochemical biomarkers (e.g., mean arterial pressure,
creatinine) previously associated with hypo- and hyper-inflammatory acute respiratory distress syndrome and
acute respiratory failure phenotypes are also present in PRF. (H2.2) These clinical and biochemical markers
can be used to predict the probability of PRF within the next 48 hours. AIM 3: To develop and deploy a
single-site, proof-of-concept, EHR-based probability scoring system, and dashboard for PRF. Hypotheses:
(H3.1) Despite the benefits of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), data mapping into the CDM may cause
information loss and decrease the predictive performance of a CDM-mapped model compared to the native,
site-specific EHR model. (H3.2) The feasibility of a multisource (e.g., real-time and historic clinical and
biomarker data) probability score, embedded in the EHR, will be demonstrated through successful deployment
in a pre-production environment. Completing these Aims, and the five papers we foresee producing from this
work will enable me to develop preliminary data for a competitive R01 proposal focused on implementing and
evaluating a validated, real-time PRF predictive model in a UC-wide multi-center study. My long-term goal is to
expand my existing program of research to enroll more geographically, epidemiologically, and
socioeconomically diverse centers and conduct a large-scale, multisite intervention study (U grant) to validate
our modeling and facilitate personalized treatment strategies to reduce the risk and burden of PRF."

This is a proposal for a two-year career transition award to study atypical B cells as a novel immunologic and
metabolic target to improve vaccine responses in immunosuppressed individuals. The candidate is currently a
postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The proposal builds on the
candidate's extensive experience in vaccine immunology and immunometabolism to understand how metabolic
reprogramming of B cells contributes to successful vaccine responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted
the need to develop and rapidly deploy highly immunogenic vaccines. However, insufficient immune responses
in immunocompromised individuals have emphasized that novel vaccine formulations may be required for
specific populations to overcome immunosuppression. To date, the basic immunology behind successful
vaccine responses during immunosuppression has not been well characterized. By dissecting the immunologic
and metabolic landscape following vaccination in immunosuppressed individuals, we hope to generate building
blocks to reverse engineer vaccines for specific patient populations. Preliminary data from the principal
investigator indicates that solid organ transplant recipients, who respond poorly to vaccination due to a variety
of immunosuppressive drugs, manage to successfully respond to COVID-19 vaccination by expanding atypical
B cells that are reliant on fatty acid oxidation. To further these findings, the principal investigator has proposed
a research plan consisting of 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will define populations of immunosuppressed individuals
who utilize atypical CD11c+ B cells as a salvage pathway to successful vaccine responses. Aim 2 will assess
atypical CD11c+ B cell and T cell interaction to determine specific immunological contexts that drive CD11c+ B
cell expansion. Aim 3 will target fatty acid oxidation using vaccine adjuvants to enhance atypical CD11c+ B cell
development. Together, these studies will answer how atypical B cells develop in the presence of
immunosuppression, what agents we can use to metabolically target them, and who will benefit from vaccine
strategies targeting atypical B cells. The principal investigator will also learn new techniques necessary to
accomplish the proposed research under the advisory team (Drs. Cox, Bailey, Durbin, Ji, and Pearce), all of
whom have pioneering expertise in vaccinology, immunology, immunometabolism, and biostatistics. Importantly,
her advisory committee collectively has a very strong track record of training both clinical and postdoctoral fellows
who have successfully transitioned into independent investigators at top tier research institutions. She will also
engage in and present at national seminars, take coursework on metabolic modeling, clinical vaccinology, Jr.
Faculty leadership program, grant-writing seminars, and training on running a laboratory. The outlined career
development and research plan will provide the candidate with unique cross-disciplinary skills that will enable
her transition to independence and identify promising strategies to improve vaccine responses in
immunocompromised individuals."
10839950,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) studies, longitudinal within-subject imaging and analysis of the human brain gives
us valuable insight into the temporal dynamics of the early disease process in individual subjects and allows to
assess therapeutic efficacy. However, longitudinal imaging tools have not yet been optimized for clinical studies
or for use on nonharmonized scans. Challenges include reduction of noise across serial magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans while weighting each time point equally to avoid biases; and appropriately accounting for
atrophy all in the presence of varying image intensity, contrasts, MR distortions and subject motion across time.
 Many general tools exist for detecting longitudinal change in carefully curated research data (such as ADNI)
in which the scan protocol has been harmonized across acquisition sites so as to minimize differential distortion
and gradient nonlinearities removed prior to data release. Unfortunately, these tools do not work accurately for
unharmonized MRI scans that comprise the bulk of the research data available, and on clinical data, where the
practical need for clinicians to schedule a subject on different scanners leads to additional differences in scans
acquired across multiple scan sessions. For retrospective analysis of past scans or clinical use, it is thus critical
to develop imaging tools that are agnostic to global scanner-induced differences in images but very sensitive to
subtle neuroanatomical change, such as atrophy in AD, that is highly predictive of the early disease process.
 To address the above issues, we propose to design, implement and validate a deep learning (DL) AD image
analysis framework for detecting neuroanatomical change in the presence of large image differences due to the
acquisition process itself, including the field strength, receive coil, sequence parameters, gradient nonlinearities
and B0 distortions, scanner manufacturer, and subject motion in the images across time. We leverage the fact
that, within a subject, there is a physical deformation that relates the brain scans acquired across time unlike the
cross-subject case. Focusing exclusively on longitudinal within-subject studies allows us to craft ultra-sensitive
registration and change detection tools that drastically outperform general purpose ones used in cross-subject
studies, where registration is intended only to find approximate anatomical correspondences. Our longitudinal
imaging framework is thus able to learn to disentangle true neuroanatomical change from irrelevant distortions.
 Since the applicant has a computational background, the proposed training program at Harvard, MIT and
MGH will focus on neuroscience and neurology during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed to transition
to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant aims to become an expert in clinical imaging of AD and push
the limits of what is currently possible in AD research, fundamentally enhancing the quality of healthcare. We
believe that the proposed project is a first step in this direction and the tools developed will further pave the way
for clinical imaging and analysis of AD and neurodegenerative disease processes in general."
10792645,"Social communication depends on the integration of sensory, emotional and cognitive information by a large
network of brain regions. While many brain regions integrate auditory and visual information, the inferior frontal
lobes (IFG) receive a wealth of sensory afferents from multiple modalities, has influence over many brain
regions involved in motor and cognitive processes, and plays a major role in our speech and language
processes. Previous investigations in primate ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a proposed homologue
of human IFG, revealed that neurons are selectively responsive to species-specific faces and to vocalizations
and perform complex integration of these communication stimuli. Furthermore, VLPFC is essential during
crossmodal working memory. These varied functions of VLPFC occur over several cytoarchitectonic regions,
each of which receives different anatomical afferents and demonstrates diverse sensory and cognitive
responses. Inability to integrate face and vocal information impairs speech processing, language learning,
recognition and semantic processing, all essential elements of social communication that VLPFC participates
in. Hence, identifying the integrative and cellular functions of VLPFC subdivisions will clarify the organization of
the primate frontal lobe and its role in disorders of communication. In this proposal, we will determine what
components of face and vocal information are integrated within VLPFC subregions and what neural
mechanism underlie integration in these subregions. In Aim 1, we will investigate which features of face and
vocal information are integrated and whether subregions of VLPFC process and integrate these stimuli
differently (i.e. What is integrated Where). We hypothesize that modality specific subregions of VLFPC will
show differential responses to manipulations of spectrotemporal features of face and vocal stimuli. In Aim 2,
we will interrogate how face and vocal stimuli are integrated by single neurons and across simultaneously
recorded ensembles during the presentation of dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli. In particular we will
determine if VLPFC neurons perform time division multiplexing, where the neural response to face-vocalization
movie shows evidence of “switching” back and forth between neural representations of the face or the vocal
stimulus during integration. Furthermore we will degrade the face and vocal stimuli in an audiovisual pair in
order to selectively diminish the contribution of the face or the vocal stimuli during integration and to determine
how this affects our temporal model of these responses. Merging ensemble recordings of responses to
naturalistic stimuli in the prefrontal cortex of Old World Primates with novel computational methods, will provide
new and valuable data on how we combine social communication information. This is of particular relevance to
understanding changes in sensory integration in intellectual disabilities such as autism spectrum disorders."

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the process by which excess cholesterol is eliminated from the
body. Disruptions in RCT contribute to a variety of metabolic diseases including atherosclerosis, insulin
resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The ABCG5 ABCG8 (G5G8) sterol
transporter facilitates sterol secretion in the hepatobiliary and transintestinal pathways. Our new data
indicate that G5G8 is indispensable in opposing dietary cholesterol accumulation, however, the relative
contribution of hepatic vs. intestinal G5G8 in opposition cholesterol accumulation is unknown. Despite
its discovery over 20 years ago, little known about the post-translational regulation of the transporter.
We've recently developed key biological reagents and approaches that will allow for the investigation
of endogenous G5G8 post-transcriptional regulation. Preliminary experiments revealed several
surprises. 1) G5G8 is localized to an intracellular compartment in vivo and in polarized hepatocytes. 2)
G5G8 translocates to the apical domain in response to stimulation with the intestinal hormone FGF15/19
in vivo. 3) G5G8 is degraded in lysosomes following heterodimer formation. We hypothesize that
hepatic G5G8 is post-translationally regulated to promote biliary cholesterol secretion but
dependent on intestinal G5G8 to prevent dietary cholesterol accumulation, mechanisms that are
disrupted by clinical variants that contribute to MetS phenotypes. Aim I will determine molecular
mechanisms of G5G8 post-translational regulation in vitro and in vivo. We will interrogate the
biosynthetic itinerary and steady state distribution of the G5G8 heterodimer in WIF-B polarized
hepatocytes. The sub-apically located structures in which it resides in unstimulated cells will be
identified. Apical translocation in response to stimuli of biliary cholesterol secretion (bile acids,
FGF15/19, etc.) will be determined and results confirmed in vivo. These studies will be replicated with
human G5G8 expressed in liver-specific G5G8-deficient mice. Aim II will determine the impact of
hepatic and intestinal G5G8 on cholesterol excretion. Control and mice and lacking G5G8 in liver,
intestine or both organs will be challenged with cholesterol-containing diets. Plasma and fecal sterols
and measures of RCT will be analyzed. Hepatic gene expression and metabolic phenotypes including
insulin sensitivity and measures of NAFLD will be assessed. Aim III will investigate the impact of human
variants of ABCG5 and ABCG8 on basal and bile acid-stimulated biliary cholesterol secretion using
novel adenoassociated viral vectors and tissue-specific G5G8-deficieny mice. We will also investigate
the effect of these variants on the development of obesity-related phenotypes in response to
cholesterol-containing diets."

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Approximately one third of patients are drug-
resistant, underscoring the need for alternative therapies. One of the biggest challenges to developing disease-
modifying therapies is the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind the initiation and
propagation of seizures. We propose to develop a novel, translational gene therapy that targets dentate gyrus
(DG) granule cells, which have been shown to act as a seizure gate. We will make use of a promoter specific to
DG granule cells, Prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox-1), to selectively express the inhibitory DREADD,
hM4D(Gi), in these cells. We hypothesize that this novel gene therapy with high translational potential will
effectively suppress spontaneously recurring seizures in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model
of temporal lobe epilepsy. We will first develop and test the sensitivity and specificity of a truncated Prox-1
promoter and enhancers (Aim1). We then will examine the efficacy of a Prox-1::hM4D(Gi)-YFP viral vector in
inhibiting DG granule cells and suppressing chronic seizures in the IHKA mouse model of epilepsy, while also
testing memory effects (Aim 2). Development of an effective and highly translatable therapy can help us better
understand the mechanisms at play during seizures, as well as improve treatment in patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. In addition to its utility in epilepsy, a Prox1-driven expression vector could have potential applications
in Alzheimer’s disease and neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in lymphatic and cancer research."
10835982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The omentum is an immune cell-rich fatty tissue that suspends from the stomach and plays an important role in
defending the peritoneal cavity against pathogens. Paradoxically, the omentum is the major site of ovarian
cancer metastasis and it is unclear why immune cells in the omentum do not effectively defend against cancer
cells. Because metastasis to the omentum can cause substantial pain and bowel obstruction, removal of the
diseased omentum is the standard-of-care. On the other hand, prophylactic removal of the omentum in ovarian
cancer patients who do not present with overt metastasis has been contentious and not universally performed.
However, there are currently no effective strategies to prevent metastasis of occult circulating cancer cells to
the omentum when this site is preserved. The goal of this study is to develop therapeutic strategies that boost
anti-tumor immunity in the omentum and thereby prevent omental metastasis. Our laboratory has previously
identified that neutrophils, the first-line of immune defense, mobilize into the omentum prior to metastasis and
extrude chromatin fibers called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Our more recent studies using genetically
modified NET-deficient mice implicate that NETs `fertilize' the omentum to become permissive for metastasis
by stimulating expansion of immunosuppressive lymphocytes. We therefore hypothesize that treatment with
NET-inhibiting agents boosts anti-tumor immunity in the omentum and thereby prevents omental metastasis. In
this study, we will firstly establish and validate a preclinical model that recapitulates omental metastasis and
enables tracing of immunosuppressive lymphocytes. By using this model, we will then evaluate the ability of
NET-inhibiting agents to decrease the pool of immunosuppressive lymphocytes in the omentum, enhance the
effectiveness of PD-1-targeted immunotherapy, and improve outcomes. If successful, our study could lead to
better quality-of-life in an underserved population of ovarian cancer patients who initially present without overt
omental metastasis. By repurposing available NET-inhibiting agents, our study could accelerate the prevention
of omental metastasis in a timely and cost-effective manner and with fewer risks."

infections. OASs are a family of ISG that belongs to an evolutionarily ancient family of nucleotidyl-transferases
(NTase). The canonical antiviral mechanism of OAS proteins involves the enzymatic synthesis of 2'-5'-
oligoadenylates, causing downstream activation of RNase L, leading to RNA degradation and inhibition of
protein synthesis. However, the host protective function of multiple enzymatically active and inactive OAS
isoforms during bacterial infection is not known. This proposal will address this knowledge gap to define the
innate antibacterial functions of two OAS family proteins, OAS1 and OASL. Our preliminary studies suggest that
human OAS1 and a mouse ortholog, Oas1b, confer protection from infection with intracellular bacteria by
enhancing the expression of several proteins including IRF1, a major antibacterial transcription factor.
Furthermore, we found that mice lacking Oasl2 (ortholog of human OASL), another member of OAS family, are
highly susceptible to intracellular bacterial infection, and show increased production of host-detrimental
inflammatory cytokines. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that specific members of OAS-
family proteins contribute to host defense against intracellular bacteria through unique NTase activity-
independent mechanisms. The goal of this proposal is to determine the innate antibacterial functions of two OAS
family proteins and the underlying mechanisms in three independent aims: (1) Identify the mechanisms of cell-
intrinsic antibacterial activity of OAS1. Here, we will define the molecular mechanism by which OAS1 mediates
cell intrinsic antibacterial defense using in vitro biochemical and cell biological approaches. (2) Determine the in
vivo role of Oas1b in anti-bacterial innate immunity. We will use a newly generated Oas1b knock-in mouse model
to identify the in vivo mediators and cell-type specific antibacterial function of Oas1b. (3) Define the role of OASL
in host defense against intracellular bacterial infections and the underlying molecular mechanism(s). Taken
together, this proposal is designed to elucidate new NTase activity-independent molecular functions of OAS
proteins, and to integrate it with antibacterial cellular defense in an innovative functional-model. Upon completion
of this study, we will establish a new paradigm of innate host defense orchestrated by OAS proteins that may
lead to new therapeutic strategies."
10842313,"PROJECT SUMMARY– FOLLOWER PROJECT 3. Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy, or Best disease (BD),
is a relatively common inherited macular degenerative disorder that results in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
dysfunction and progressive loss of central vision. BD is caused by over 200 different missense mutations in the
BEST1 gene. Currently, there are no treatments for autosomal dominant BD due in part to the absence of
relevant animal models. To overcome the difficulties in modeling the effects of many pathogenic BEST1
mutations, we utilize patient-specific iPSC-RPE models to develop a biological system that can rapidly screen
genome editing leads. As in Follower Project 2, we hypothesize that Cas9-mediated indel formation by the leads
in the mutant BEST1 allele will cause frameshifts leading to premature stop codons and resulting in nonsense-
mediated decay of the edited transcript, removing the dominant-negative effect and restoring function to the wild-
type allele. Our objective in Project 3 is to develop an SNC product, SNC-201, containing a Cas9 payload
to specifically target BEST1 mutant alleles and compare various approaches using ribonucleoproteins (RNPs)
and Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs. To achieve this, we will pursue four aims. First, we will generate dual BEST1 allele
BD iPSC-RPE reporter systems to facilitate on/off-target analysis of mutant allele targeting. We have developed
a BD dual reporter iPSC line that has the mutant BEST1 allele linked to a 3’ tdTomato reporter and the wild-type
BEST1 allele linked to a 3’ GFP reporter. Via fluorescent imaging, we can monitor the expression of both the
targeted mutant BEST1 allele and the wild-type allele, which is the top ‘off-target’ site for our strategy. Plus, we
can monitor channel function on sorted cells. We will adapt this reporter iPSC line to create a wild-type and eight
additional mutant lines. Second, we compare the modular editor components of the lead SNC-201s. Using the
dual reporter systems transfected with SNC formulations containing RNPs or Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, we will rapidly
screen SNC formulations to disrupt each mutant allele in dual reporter iPSC-RPEs. A comparison of the editing
efficiency of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and RNP will be achieved through this work. Third, we scale up the synthesis
of the SNC RNP leads and rely on Lead Project 1 for protocols to scale up mRNA/sgRNA leads. Finally, we
generate a preclinical package for SNC-201 targeting selected mutant BEST1 alleles. After evaluating the safety
of an SNC-201 formulation in nonhuman primates, we will complete one INTERACT meeting with the FDA for a
product that intends to treat BD patients with multiple different mutations. After obtaining feedback, we will draft
a clinical development plan for a pre-IND meeting. Successful completion of our aims will provide a
rigorous, stepwise approach to developing an IND for targeting specific mutations – a strategy that could
be expanded for all individuals with BD – and address central questions pertaining to the application of
gene editing for genotypically heterogeneous dominant diseases. It will also advance the utility of iPSC
models as custom preclinical tools to rapidly develop somatic cell genome editing strategies."
10884400,"Recent American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) cholesterol guidelines
put atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment at the center of decision-making for
initiating and dosing of lipid-lowering therapies including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.
Nonetheless, there remains controversy regarding how efficiently this guideline directs medication to those
who will receive a large absolute ASCVD risk reduction benefit. For primary prevention, the 2018 AHA/ACC
guideline introduced the concept of risk-enhancing factors to identify individuals who have a risk higher than
predicted by the pooled cohort equations (PCE). The presence of risk-enhancing factors supports a decision to
initiate or intensify statin therapy in patients with borderline and intermediate risk. However, the guideline did
not quantify how much a risk-enhancing factor changes an individual's 10-year risk, making decisions to treat
or not to treat informed by the risk-enhancing factors ultimately subjective. Social determinants of health
(SDOH) are important ASCVD risk factors. The PCE systematically underestimates risk for individuals who are
socially deprived; however, SDOH are not included in the PCE or considered as risk-enhancing factors in the
current guidelines. Additionally, the PCE's performance is questionable in Hispanics and Asians, the two
fastest growing minority groups in the US. For secondary prevention, the 2018 guideline recommends high-
intensity statin therapy for the 24 million US adults with established ASCVD, with ezetimibe and PCSK9
inhibitors recommended for a subset with a very high risk for recurrent ASCVD, defined by a history of multiple
major ASCVD events or one major event with multiple high-risk conditions. However, recent evidence suggests
that this definition may classify too many individuals (>50%) as having very high risk. Additionally, women,
racial/ethnic minorities, and those with adverse SDOH may have a higher risk for recurrent ASCVD, but those
factors were not considered in the current guideline when defining very high risk of recurrent ASCVD.
To address these gaps in the literature and guidelines, our study proposes to 1) quantify how much the
presence or absence of each risk-enhancing factor (including SDOH and Hispanic and Asian subgroups) and
their combinations change 10-year ASCVD risk beyond PCE predictions; 2) determine the algorithm that
optimizes the discrimination of individuals at very high risk for a recurrent ASCVD event; and 3) compare the
health, economic, and health equity impact among US adults of selecting individuals for lipid-lowering
therapies according to approaches identified in Aims 1 and 2 vs. in the 2018 cholesterol guideline.
This study will develop approaches that improve the precision of cholesterol treatment guidelines in US adults,
and help direct treatment to ethnic subgroups and groups with a high burden of adverse SDOH who have a
high ASCVD risk but may not be recommended treatment by current national cholesterol guidelines. Findings
from this study will inform future guidelines, improve cardiovascular outcomes, and narrow health inequities."

10880422,"ABSTRACT
 Androgen receptor (AR) is ligand-activated transcription factor and a driver of prostate cancer (PCa).
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of AR-mediated transcription is a key for the development of novel
therapeutic strategies for both castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) and castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). It is well-known that AR transcriptional activity is prominently dictated by the transcription
activator FOXA1, which acts as a ‘pioneer’ factor opening the condensed chromatin and facilitating the
recruitment of AR. Genome sequencing studies have revealed that FOXA1 is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in primary PCa and even more common in metastatic CRPC. Aberrant FOXA1 function is
implicated in PCa development and progression likely through its impact on AR signaling. Therefore, inhibition
of AR through targeting FOXA1 is a promising therapeutic approach for CRPC. However, to date FOXA1 has
been deemed undruggable. We recently reported that critical to the function of FOXA1 is its modulation by
poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP-2), conventionally known as a DNA repair protein. Our studies have
demonstrated that PARP-2 is a critical component in AR signaling through interacting with FOXA1 and
facilitating AR recruitment to prostate-specific enhancers. Expression of PARP-2 is significantly elevated in
primary PCa tumors compared to benign prostate tissues, and even higher in CRPC tumors. Selective
targeting of PARP-2 by genetic or pharmacological means blocks PARP-2/FOXA1 interaction, which in turn
attenuates AR-mediated gene expression and PCa growth. These results lead us to the hypothesis that PARP-
2 plays a central role in AR-mediated transcription through interacting with FOXA1. Therefore, PARP-2
Inhibition attenuates AR signaling through disrupting FOXA1 function, which provides an alternative
therapeutic strategy for AR inhibition without involving AR ligand binding.
 The overall objective of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which selective targeting
of PARP-2 inhibits CRPC growth through disruption of FOXA1 function and define PARP-2 as an alternative
therapeutic target for CRPC. To attain the overall objective, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine
the molecular mechanisms by which targeting the PARP-2/FOXA1 interaction inhibits AR signaling. Aim 2:
Determine to what extent selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits CRPC tumor growth in preclinical models. The
successful implementation of this project will greatly advance our understanding of multifaceted biology of
PARP proteins and their evolving impact on cancer therapeutics. More specifically, the results from the
proposed research are expected to provide a strong basis for future development and clinical application of
selective PARP-2 inhibitors benefiting patients with incurable metastatic CRPC."
10864970,"Protein quality control systems are essential for maintaining neuronal health, with vacuolar dependent pathways
playing a primary role in these systems. The endolysosome system is a major contributor to the maintenance of
the neuronal proteome, and dysfunction of this system occurs early in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) , and likely contributes to the accumulation and mislocalization of tau, which plays a key role in disease
pathogenesis. Recent data provide compelling evidence that the stress responsive, multi-domain protein, Bcl-2-
associated anthogene 3 (BAG3) plays a role in maintaining protein homeostasis and neuronal health. The
expression of BAG3 in specific neuronal populations positively correlates with resistance to the development of
tau pathology in AD. Further, our preliminary data indicate that BAG3 is an upstream regulator of vacuolar
dependent pathways. The UNDERLYING PREMISE of this proposal is that in neurons, BAG3 plays a critical
role in mediating vacuolar dependent pathways, and thus proteostasis and neuronal integrity. The importance
of BAG3 in mediating proteostasis is illustrated by the fact that BAG3 not only plays an important role in protecting
neurons from the accumulation of pathological tau species, but also likely supports synaptic structure.
Nonetheless, our understanding of the mechanisms by which BAG3 regulates vacuolar dependent processes is
very limited. Although previous studies have implicated BAG3 as a mediator of autophagy, we are the first to
present evidence that BAG3 is a regulator of the endolysosome pathway. Further, our preliminary findings
implicate BAG3 as an important modulator of endosomal sorting required for transport (ESCRT) machinery.
BAG3 interacts withTBC1D10B, the primary GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rab35, which facilitates the
recruitment of the ESCRT machinery and protein clients to the endosome, as well as mediating other vacuolar
dependent processes. The conceptual framework that BAG3 acts upstream of vacuolar pathways through its
regulation of Rab35 activity is novel and innovative. The OVERALL HYPOTHESIS of this proposal is that the
BAG3-TBC1D10B-Rab35 signaling axis regulates endosome-lysosome function and neuronal health. In
the context of this overall hypothesis the specific aims of this proposal are: to test the hypotheses that: (1) the
BAG3-TBC1D10B-Rab35 signaling axis regulates ESCRT and the endolysosome pathway, (2) in vivo BAG3
and Rab35 coordinate to mediate neuronal ESCRT/vacuolar processes, and contribute to the maintenance
synaptic integrity, and (3) the BAG3-TBC1D10B-Rab35 axis plays a critical role in regulating the clearance of
pathological tau species. These studies will be carried out using mouse models and primary neuron cultures.
The IMPACT of these studies is that they will provide crucial new insights into the mechanisms by which BAG3
acts as an upstream mediator of the endolysosome systems to maintain a healthy neuron. Overall these studies
represent a new, unexplored area of investigation that will increase our understanding of the factors that are
essential to maintain a healthy, functional neuronal proteome."
10837104,"SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer world-wide with over 600,000 new cases per
year and a dismal five-year survival rate at less than 9%. Most HCC patients have chronic liver disease resulting
mainly from HCV/HBV infection, chronic alcohol consumption or aflatoxin exposure. Although most patients that
develop HCC have cirrhosis or hepatitis, the mechanisms promoting HCC differ between pathologies such that
not all cases should be treated the same. This proposal is aimed at understanding the mechanisms that promote
HCC due to chronic ethanol exposure, a form of HCC that is on the rise as HCV and HBV infections are being
better prevented and treated. In particular, this proposal is focused on understanding chromosome 8q24
amplification that is observed more frequently in alcohol-induced HCC. Because c-Myc resides on this amplified
region, we propose that at later stages of HCC, chromosome 8q24 is amplified leading to high c-Myc levels. The
high Myc promotes Miz1 transcriptional repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype and acquisition of
mesenchymal cell traits. Concomitantly, the high c-Myc activates Zeb1 expression driving cells through the
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) further repressing the epithelial phenotype. As cells metastasize and
colonize at secondary sites, epithelial traits are partially reacquired as cells progress through the mesenchymal
to epithelial transition (MET). Our hypothesis is that the temporal expression patterns of c-Myc, Zeb1 and
Miz1 and epithelial vs. mesenchymal traits are unique in patients with alcohol-induced HCC and can
predict prognosis, drug resistance and potential treatment strategies. In Aim 1 we ask two major questions:
1) does 8q24 amplification drive EMT in alcohol-associated HCC? and 2) do metastatic lesions reacquire a more
epithelial phenotype? To answer these questions, we will examine protein expression patterns using
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of paraffin-embedded human HCC resections (to answer question 1) and
affected lymph nodes and metastatic lesions (to answer question 2). Staining will be correlated to cancer stage,
clinicopathologic variables, alcohol consumption and patient responses to treatment. We will also confirm 8q24
amplification using FISH analysis of c-Myc expression. To directly determine the temporal relationship between
c-Myc, Miz1, Zeb1 and the epithelial vs. mesenchymal phenotypes, we will perform targeted transcriptome
analysis and morphological analysis of human benign and HCC tissue. We will also perform overexpression and
knockdown studies to directly establish the temporal relationship between c-Myc, Miz1, Zeb1 and epithelial vs.
mesenchymal phenotypes in selected cell lines and primary human normal and HCC cells in culture. Finally,
due to the tremendous need to develop new strategies for effective combination therapies to treat HCC, we will
examine drug sensitivity in cells to clinically relevant compounds. We have garnered the support of several others
to provide their expertise to the project. We have continued access to the Imaging Facility located at nearby
Johns Hopkins Medical School and are members of the Hopkins GI Center allowing us access to many services
and resources. The expansive expertise of our collaborators and the access to human tissue samples and high-
end resources coupled with our considerable expertise in polarized hepatic cell biology situate us perfectly to
perform these important mechanistic and translational studies."
10896255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The potential for the development of novel therapeutic modalities has energized the genome editing field since
it first emerged in the 1990s and especially since the demonstration of programmable genome editing with
CRISPR-Cas9 by multiple groups in 2012. There has been substantial progress with ex vivo therapeutic
applications of genome editing in patients in the past few years, most notably with CAR-T immunotherapies for
cancer and with durable treatment of hemoglobinopathies. Progress with in vivo therapeutic applications, i.e.,
somatic cell genome editing, has been slower due to the technical challenges inherent in the delivery of genome-
editing tools into the body. As of the time of this writing, there are few published examples of successful genome
editing performed in vivo in primates (including humans), with almost all examples involving somatic genome
editing in the liver: TTR with Cas9 nuclease delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), PCSK9 and ANGPTL3
with adenine base editors delivered by LNPs, and PCSK9 with meganucleases delivered by adeno-associated
virus (AAV) vectors. The prospects for genome-editing therapies extend to before birth, with in utero genome
editing having the potential to treat genetic diseases that result in significant morbidity and mortality before or
shortly after birth. Although restricted to small animal models so far, in utero genome editing has proven effective
in the liver, lungs, heart, and other organs.
Our Overall Program seeks to build on these early successes, pursuing goals that that would be of major impact
in advancing the field of therapeutic genome editing. Our three Research Projects seek to develop base-editing
therapies targeting the liver in order to treat three rare metabolic genetic diseases: phenylketonuria (PKU),
hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), and mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPSI). Lead Project 1 will focus on
LNP-based postnatal treatment of PKU, with the aim to file an IND application by the end of the five-year
funding period and begin a phase 1/2 clinical trial soon afterwards. Project 2 will focus on LNP-based postnatal
treatment of HT1, with the aim to file an IND application and begin a clinical trial, and prenatal treatment of
HT1, with the aim of performing preclinical studies during the five-year funding period to enable an eventual IND
application if the postnatal clinical trial proves successful. Project 3 will focus on AAV-based postnatal and
prenatal treatment of MPSI, with similar aims as Project 2. Unique, specialized Resource Cores focused on
off-target editing and in utero treatment of small and large animals will be indispensable in achieving these aims."
10885102,"Project Summary / Abstract
Natural products continue to provide important drug leads in medicine. While the majority of clinical
antibiotics are derived from bacterial natural products, the emergence of antibiotic resistance emphasizes
the need to discover new antimicrobial leads. This renewal application builds upon a productive
collaboration between the Jensen (microbiology/bioinformatics) and Moore (biosynthesis/natural
products chemistry) laboratories to address this need through the mining of microbial genomes and
metagenomes for new bioactive compounds. We have prioritized two diverse groups of chemically gifted
marine bacteria for study from a collection of >10,000 strains collected across the world’s oceans. We
continue our efforts with the obligate marine actinomycete Salinispora, which produces the potent
proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (Marizomib) that is presently in phase III trials to treat brain
cancer. Here we capitalize on the recent identification of six new Salinispora species and 99 new
genomes to expand our efforts in this unique taxon. We further expand our genome mining efforts to
include the MAR4 lineage, a second chemically gifted group of marine bacteria for which we are uniquely
situated to explore with 42 new genomes. This lineage shows the first evidence that marine adaptations
are linked to natural product biosynthesis and includes at least six new species. We have identified
hundreds of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in these two groups and prioritized them as lead
discovery targets. We have further taken this program into new directions by mining BGCs directly from
environmental DNA (eDNA) using a nontargeted metagenomic approach that provides unbiased access
to the biosynthetic potential of microbial diversity. These samples originate from both shallow tropical
ocean sediments (1515 natural product BGCs already assembled) as well as deep sea sediments (down
to 2000 meters) that are being collected for this program and have yet to be explored for natural products
research. We will maximize access to these unique resources and employ innovative techniques in
genome mining and synthetic biology to prioritize the targeted discovery of new antibiotic leads such as
beta-lactone-containing products from eDNA that are predicted to inhibit protease virulence factors in
Gram(-) bacteria. These genome mining efforts are governed by a logical workflow that prioritizes novel
antibiotic discovery from poorly explored microbial resources."

10884365,"Reactivation of chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection causes ocular, cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic disease in immune-deficient individuals. Current treatments fail to eliminate the slow replicating, persistent Toxoplasma bradyzoite cysts that seed reactivation and disease, which manifests most severely as Toxoplasmic encephalitis. Our long-term goal is to identify critical liabilities for disrupting Toxoplasma persistence, thereby eliminating the risk of potentially fatal Toxoplasmic encephalitis in at-risk individuals. Toward this goal, we have recently demonstrated that the viability of bradyzoite cysts in culture and in infected mice critically relies on the parasite having a functional autophagy pathway based on targeted disruption of TgATG9. TgATG9 deficient bradyzoites show markedly reduced autophagy and severe loss of viability in culture and in experimentally infected mice. Since autophagy is necessary for cellular homeostasis, our findings support a new concept of disrupting parasite homeostasis to quell infection. However, little is known about autophagy in Toxoplasma and pursuing this concept requires identifying new and divergent components in the pathway. To meet this need, we will discover novel early components of the autophagy pathway, define how they cooperatively mediate the development of autophagic structures, and determine their contributions to parasite persistence in vitro and in vivo. Completing the proposed studies will provide proof-of-concept that targeting parasite homeostasis is an effective strategy to disrupt persistence."
10821481,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Chronic stress causes molecular adaptations and structural remodeling of neurons within corticolimbic
brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). This is important because the PFC
and HPC are integrated in brain circuits that regulate complex behaviors and cognition. Preclinical and clinical
studies indicate that synapse loss and reduced connectivity in the PFC and HPC contribute to behavioral and
cognitive symptoms in several psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major
depressive disorder (MDD). While previous reports have identified candidate genes and pathways, the molecular
mechanisms that cause lasting stress-induced changes in gene activity patterns and structural remodeling in
neurons remain unknown. In preliminary studies, exposing mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) triggered
the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) within stress-activated neurons in the PFC. Administration of
the GABAA receptor agonist, diazepam, diminished both the number of stress-activated neurons and the levels
of DSBs, suggesting that stress-induced DSBs are generated by activity-dependent mechanisms. Accumulating
evidence indicates that neuronal activity induces the topoisomerase, topoisomerase II (Top2B) to generate
DSBs and promote the transcription of an important subset of genes that mediate experience-driven synaptic
changes, including early response genes (ERGs), such as Fos, Npas4, Egr1, and Arc. These results suggest
that experience-dependent DSB formation could regulate stress-induced gene activity patterns and subsequent
remodeling of neurons. Yet the sites of stress-induced DSBs in PFC and HPC neurons have not been mapped
and how DSBs affect stress-related gene activity patterns has not been explored.
 Interestingly, preliminary studies revealed that recurrent and ectopic induction of Top2B-mediated DSBs
in cultured neurons is sufficient to recapitulate chronic stress-induced gene expression profiles for various
neuronal activity-responsive genes, including ERGs and Bdnf. Preliminary chromosome conformation capture
(3C)-based experiments (3C and 4C-seq) further suggest that DSBs regulate gene activity patterns by altering
chromatin topology. These observations have led to the hypothesis that recurrent DSB formation during chronic
stress alters chromatin architecture at associated genes, which in turn, stabilizes stress-related gene activity
patterns that trigger neuronal remodeling and synapse loss in the PFC and HPC. To test this hypothesis, the
proposed studies will map genome-wide sites of CUS-induced DSBs and utilize conditional deletion of Top2b to
define how DSBs affect stress-dependent changes in transcription and neuronal structure and function in PFC
and HPC projection neurons. Additionally, 3C-based methods (HiChIP) will be employed to assess how DSBs
affect stress-dependent changes to chromatin architecture. Together, these efforts will provide novel insights
into the mechanisms driving stress-induced neuronal adaptations, and may uncover new therapeutic strategies
for psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and MDD."
10850676,"ABSTRACT
The origin of racial and ethnic disparities in obstetric outcomes does not appear to be genetic nor fully explained
by individual-level factors. Hence, we must look toward the broader context in the physical, social and built
environments to understand and mitigate disparities in maternal and child health. In the physical, social and built
environments, air pollution, neighborhood disadvantage, and residential greenness may play important roles. As
compared to low birth weight, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth, considerably less is known about air
pollution exposure's impact on stillbirth, defined as an intrauterine fetal death that occurs at or after 20 weeks of
gestation. Urban air pollution is a complex mixture of particle and gaseous pollutants, often correlated because
they are influenced by common nearby sources and meteorology and thus, simultaneously studying exposure
to multiple air pollutants is challenging. Previous studies on the risk of stillbirth associated with air pollution
exposure have largely focused on pollutant-specific effects, including our studies examining ozone and metal
constituents of PM in the fourth largest city in the U.S., Houston, Texas. Using source apportionment to assess
air pollutant exposures takes advantage of the highly correlated nature of the air pollutant mixture, quantifies the
contributions of different source categories and provides information that allows more targeted control strategies
to be developed. To date, we are aware of only one study that applied source apportionment for fine particulate
matter, and it used the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor modeling. Yet, that investigation used
estimated source contributions as if they were true exposures without accounting for spatial misalignment error
and inherent uncertainty in the method itself. Addressing these shortcomings, we will apply an innovative
approach that integrates Bayesian spatial multivariate receptor models (BSMRM) with land-use and traffic data
as well as accounting for exposure measurement errors in health effects estimation. Like air pollution, the social
and built environments cluster neighborhood-level exposures that adversely impact health. These stressors are
often greater among minority and low-income populations who suffer what has been termed “double jeopardy”.
The objective of the proposed study is three-fold. First, we wish to evaluate the impact of source-specific
multipollutant exposures on stillbirth using an innovative approach that integrates BSMRM with land-use and
traffic data and accounting for exposure measurement errors in health effects estimation. We hypothesize that
increased air pollutant source-apportioned concentrations will be associated with increased risk of stillbirth and
that effect sizes will be different for different source categories. Second, we wish to examine the impact of the
neighborhood context on risk of stillbirth. Third, given the priority of health disparities for the NIH and the nation,
another objective is to evaluate the hypothesis that minorities will suffer disproportionate stillbirth risks associated
with air pollutant source-apportioned concentrations and with living in deprived neighborhoods, as assessed by
neighborhood disadvantage and residential greenness."

observed. Using multiple human cell line models we also demonstrate that loss of CHD1 and MAP3K7
promotes castrate-resistant prostate cancer. This project will evaluate downstream targets of AR altered in
tumors with loss of MAP3K7 and CHD1 using functional genomics in vitro and in animal models and assess
the clinical impact of these targets on patient outcome. This work could have impact on the management of the
most aggressive prostate cancer. Co-deletion of CHD1 and MAP3K7 occurs in 10-15 % of primary tumors.
Relapse occurs in approximately 50% of patients with co-deletion. If these deletions occur in primary tumors
and predict poor survival, men could be stratified based on MAP3K7 and CHD1 status. A functional
understanding of this variant of prostate cancer could lead to novel therapeutic targeting strategies in the future."

MYC is a key transcriptional regulator involved in cellular proliferation and has established roles in transcriptional
elongation and initiation, microRNA regulation, apoptosis, and pluripotency. More importantly, MYC has been
directly implicated in over 50% of human cancers and is recognized as a general hallmark of cancer initiation
and maintenance. Despite this prevalence, there are few functional chemical probes for MYC and no
therapeutics that target it. We have discovered a compound, KJ-Pyr-9, that binds to MYC with high potency and
specificity, downregulates the transcriptional activities of MYC and, most importantly, is the first MYC ligand that
shows efficacy in vivo. However, while SAR efforts were able to improve the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties of the scaffold, it remains insufficient for therapeutic use. This endeavor did yield
several valuable probes, one of which, RSH470, exhibits an increase in fluorescence in the presence of MYC.
HDX-MS experiment revealed that RSH470 binds a novel site in the critical bHLH-LZ motif of MYC. Excitingly,
modeling and single amino acids mutations of the site have validated this finding and provided a structural
explanation of the inhibitor mechanism.
Utilizing RSH470, we have developed the first fluorescence-based HTS screening competition assay that
specifically identifies MYC inhibitors and does not require protein modification, DNA binding, or the
complimentary dimer partner MAX. Furthermore, it is simple, inexpensive, and free of proprietary restrictions that
limit available HTS assays for MYC. The effectiveness of this assay has been validated by established orthogonal
methods (BLI, Bio-FET, SPR) and cellular oncogenic transformation experiments. Furthermore, structurally
distinct compounds, with specific cellular activity, have been discovered by pilot screens performed on both
Scripps Research campuses. In this proposal, we present a strategy to screen of the entire >665,000 Scripps
Drug Discovery Library (SDDL) to identify novel MYC inhibitor scaffolds. A secondary HTS with and without MYC
will determine whether hit activity is MYC dependent. Hits selected by a medicinal chemist will then be validated
by bio-layer interferometry (BLI), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and field-effect transistor analysis (Bio-
FET). Cellular potency and MYC specificity will be established through oncogenic transformation assays with
orthogonal oncogenes as well as with inhibitor resistant MYC mutants cell lines. The pharmacokinetics properties
of leads compounds will be assessed in vitro before their final evaluation in an established xenograft model. This
research program will produce a set of precisely characterized chemical leads with a strong correlation between
in vitro and in vivo efficacy. Not only will these compounds be beneficial in the study MYC functions, but they will
may lead to a therapeutic strategy for MYC driven cancers."

This is a proposal to re-fund a recently established post-doctoral training program at Columbia University focused
on training physicians in research techniques that will form the basis of careers in translational investigation of
cancer biology, diagnosis and treatment. We will identify and recruit individuals with outstanding research
potential who have completed clinical training in medical oncology and prepare them for productive careers as
translational investigators in oncology. We will utilize a comprehensive two-year program comprised of didactics,
workshops, small group sessions, coursework, including a possible master's degree, and individualized training
within the research programs of Columbia University faculty to develop the careers of the participants. Funds
are requested in a graded fashion to support up to 6 trainees annually.
The Molecular Oncology Training Program faculty is comprised of 46 independent investigators who will provide
direct supervision of the trainees. The faculty members are uniformly funded by the NCI, other branches of the
NIH and other cancer-focused research organizations and have established themselves as thought-leaders in a
broad range of cancer-related disciplines. Faculty members are divided into the main thematic areas of the
training program: I) Precision Oncology and Systems Biology, II) Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics and III)
Tumor Biology and Microenvironment. Participating faculty have been identified on the basis of their research
productivity and quality, demonstrated collaboration with other investigators, often across research disciplines,
and a history of supporting and developing research careers that transition beyond the post-doctoral level. The
trainees will be chosen competitively from a highly select group of committed physician researchers on the basis
of past accomplishments and their potential to develop careers as productive, independent translational
investigators.
The Molecular Oncology Training Program will be supported by the diverse research resources at Columbia
University and the ongoing expansion and commitment to oncology that has included both laboratory and
clinically focused research. The expansion was heralded by the opening of the Irving Cancer Research Center
a 300,000 square-foot building within the Columbia University Irving Medical Center that is entirely dedicated to
cancer research and the ongoing recruitment of leading clinical-translational research faculty to the Division of
Hematology and Medical Oncology. These changes have significantly broadened the diversity of research at
Columbia University with a concomitant increase in quality that has established Columbia in the top tier of
oncology programs and has attracted a pool of consummately trained physicians committed to careers in
translational cancer biology."

With age, individuals are often faced with more negative life events, such as declining health or the death of a
loved one. But, older adults tend to report better emotional well-being than younger adults (e.g., more positive
affect, greater happiness), and older adults show a greater attention to and appreciation for positive
information relative to negative information compared to younger adults. These differences suggest that basic
cognitive and emotional processes may change in older age, becoming more positive in general. However,
most of the existing evidence regarding these age differences is based on self-report measures and lab-based
tasks. Thus, it is uncertain whether these age differences are observable in the “real-world.” Furthermore, the
reasons for age differences in emotional well-being or appreciation for positive information are unclear. The
proposed project is a feasibility study in which an innovative behavioral assessment will be utilized to test
whether age differences in emotional well-being and appreciation of positive information can be captured in
natural, everyday social environments. Furthermore, a behavioral assessment of present moment time
perspective will be tested as a possible mechanism underlying age differences in emotional well-being and
appreciation for positive information. An adult life-span sample (N =120; 40 young adults, 40 middle-aged
adults, and 40 older adults) will be recruited to wear a digital recording device for four days (two week days
and two weekend days), recording for at least eight consecutive hours each day. Audio recordings will then be
coded for emotional well-being, positivity versus negativity, and time perspective. Older age is expected to be
related to better emotional well-being. That is, older adults' conversations are expected to contain more
behavioral indicators of positive mood (e.g., laughter, calmness). Older age is also expected to be associated
with greater emphasis on positive than negative information, as indexed by a greater proportion of positive
conversation content than negative content. Finally, older age is expected to be associated with greater focus
on present time, rather than past or future, as indexed by conversation content and verb tense. Differential time
perspective may account for age differences in emotional well-being and positivity. The proposed project will
clarify whether age differences in emotional well-being and appreciation for positive information are
phenomena observable in everyday life and will potentially elucidate an underlying mechanism – present time
perspective. The proposed feasibility study will provide a novel, ecologically valid assessment tool of emotional
well-being, positivity, and time perspective in an adult lifespan sample and will serve as the foundation for
future collaboration between the team members and research on healthy aging. In particular, findings from this
study may inform interventions to promote emotional well-being and subsequent mental and physical health in
older adults, as well as people of all ages."

A key priority for combatting the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic is shortening the length of treatment required
to reliably cure TB. A critical impediment to drug and regimen development is the lack of metrics of effective
treatment response for use in drug discovery and pre-clinical development. Two factors considered crucial to
shortening treatment are the capacity of a drug to penetrate and accumulate in lung lesions and the inherent
activity of a drug against residual drug-tolerant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) populations that survive initial
drug killing. This proposal focuses on the inherent treatment-shortening activity of drugs, independent of PK.
Unfortunately, the bacteriological basis of why existing TB drugs and regimens vary in treatment-shortening
activity remains unclear. This project evaluates the basis of drug treatment-shortening activity in TB, focusing
particularly on the role of overall bacterial activity and replication during treatment. Conventionally, drugs are
assessed based on the degree to which they lower Mtb burden. Our alternative approach evaluates how drugs
affect fundamental bacterial cellular processes. Specifically, we developed an assay that quantifies how drugs
affect ongoing ribosomal RNA synthesis called RS ratio. We found TB drugs and regimens that shorten treatment
profoundly suppress rRNA synthesis; whereas drugs with high bactericidal activity but low treatment-shortening
activity allow surviving Mtb populations to sustain rRNA synthesis. The RS ratio is already transforming drug
development pipelines and clinical trials, but the physiological basis for the predictive power of the RS ratio
needs to be fully elucidated. Since the rate of rRNA synthesis is fundamentally correlated with replication rate,
we hypothesize that Mtb replication during treatment is an important unrecognized factor in treatment-shortening.
Aim 1 will elucidate the effect of diverse drugs on replication while validating the RS ratio as a measure of Mtb
replication and establishing a series of confirmatory molecular assays. Aim 2 will test the paradigm in vivo by
evaluating pairwise combinations selected based on their potency on inhibiting Mtb replication. Collectively, our
innovations are moving beyond crude measures of bacterial burden to a new era in which drugs and regimens
are evaluated based on nuanced multifaceted molecular testing of their impact on fundamental physiologic
processes of the pathogen."

statistical support, the Core provides advanced statistical methods and expertise in the design, conduct a nd
analysis of clinical research and laboratory studies to CFAR investigators. This includes the development of
novel methods when standard approaches are not adequate or optimal by providing a crucial link between CFAR
biomedical researchers and the large number of biostatistics and other quantitative sciences faculty at the
University of Washington and the Fred Hutch who are developing novel statistical methods. New in this
application is the additional expertise in qualitative methods, bringing both qualitative and quantitative expertise
together in one cohesive group. Finally, the core provides training in both standard statistical methods as well
as more advanced topics involving specialized method for complex new data types and provides an opportunity
for the next generation of quantitative researchers and leaders. Finally, the support we provide contributes to the
innovative, impactful, multidisciplinary and global research of all members who collaborate with our core.
We propose three specific aims to achieve these goals stated above: 1. Provide statistical leadership and
support, including study design, database development, analysis and reporting to CFAR researchers; 2. Provide
leadership, mentorship and assistance in the use of qualitative methods, especially within the fields of behavioral
and implementation science, to build CFAR capacity to evaluate context and incorporate personal
experiences within their research studies; and 3. Provide training and exposure to rigorous qualitative and
quantitative methods for all CFAR researchers."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically altered HIV disease progression, but emerging complications of
HIV from chronic immune activation and metabolic changes when the virus is largely suppressed are driving
morbidity and mortality in the contemporary ART era. PWH develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes,
cancer, cognitive and functional decline at ages 10-15 years younger than uninfected controls. Geriatric
syndromes such as frailty and multimorbidity are becoming increasingly prevalent in PWH, leading to more
hospitalizations and deaths. Thus, there is an urgent need for research on aging in PWH. The 2023-28 CCR
Core will leverage an unparalleled combination of resources developed over 25 years to support
interdisciplinary clinical, epidemiologic, socio-behavioral, translational, and basic research at the interface of
HIV and aging through the following specific aims. AIM 1. Target expansion of the UW HIV Information
System, UW HIV Cohort and novel IT to support emerging HIV research priorities: develop, test, and
scale innovative technologies to ascertain new data and adjudicate key comorbid outcomes and extend these
platforms to multi-center HIV research consortia such as the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems
(CNICS). AIM 2. Improve clinical outcomes through comorbidity research at the intersection of HIV and
aging: foster an inclusive, collaborative research environment engaging local experts and ESI in HIV-
associated Comorbidity Research Collaborations (CRCs) conducting high-impact research focused on
prevention and treatment of CVD, metabolic, neurologic, pulmonary, liver disease, cancer, aging and emerging
priorities such as COVID-19 in PWH. CCR Core leadership of large multi-center HIV networks, such as CNICS
and the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), facilitates access
to data and specimens for PWH across North America, increasing the scope and generalizability of research.
AIM 3. Support clinical, translational and basic HIV research and enhance community engagement:
provide high-quality clinical data, consultation on feasibility and study design, analytic datasets with
adjudicated outcomes (e.g., strokes) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as current substance use,
specimens, and eligible study participants from a single entity. The Core will connect study teams to clinical
teams and the community to inform research priorities, facilitate study implementation and better engage with
underrepresented groups to advance equity and inclusion. AIM 4: Mentor the next generation of HIV
investigators: CCR Core multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology, data science,
health informatics, biostatistics, clinical medicine, basic and translational research will train ESI in study design,
methods (qualitative, quantitative), statistical analysis, manuscript and grant writing, and facilitate participation
in CRCs and multi-center HIV networks (e.g., CNICS, NA-ACCORD, International epidemiologic Databases to
Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium) to support development of the next generation of HIV researchers."

The newly merged Immunology, Retrovirology and Cure (IRC) Core will provide technological expertise,
practical support, consulting, and mentorship in HIV laboratory sciences. Based on our and NIH’s evaluation of
recent progress and remaining research gaps, we aim to especially support three priority areas: 1) HIV latency
and cure, 2) HIV vaccine design for prevention and cure, and 3) the processes underlying chronic inflammation
and comorbidities in people living with HIV (PLH). We also plan to target our support to 1) early-stage
investigators, e.g., by convening a Junior Investigator Group (JIG) monthly; 2) underrepresented minority
(URM) investigators, leveraging activities towards increasing URM participation at our institutions and in
collaboration with our Office for Community Engagement (OCE); and 3) basic scientists new to HIV/AIDS,
ensuring that information about HIV-related NIH concepts, RFAs, and key conferences and workshops are
disseminated to basic scientists in Seattle who have primarily conducted research in other fields. We will also
provide specific suggestions for potential collaborations with our IRC Core faculty, members, and users.
The extreme diversity of HIV necessitates continual reevaluation of how innate and adaptive immune
responses change the composition of HIV quasi-species, and, conversely, of how the biology of HIV and
therapeutic interventions (for example the induced reactivation of latent proviruses) influence antiviral
immunity. To emphasize this intricate link between virus biology and antiviral immunity, we are proposing to
unite virus-focused and immunity-focused laboratory sciences into a single core, co-led by a virologist (Dr.
Keith Jerome) and an immunologist (Dr. Florian Hladik). A combined core, supported by a single, highly
experienced, and dedicated core administrator (Tom Andrus), will provide a streamlined user experience,
enabling us to optimally consult investigators on selecting and implementing the most appropriate techniques
for their research questions. Merging of scientific expertise and resources into one Core is also responsive to
CFAR member surveys by simplifying access to the large array of expertise, instruments, and assays we offer.
Our Specific Aims are to : 1) Offer scientific guidance and consultation to investigators, with special focus on
those at an early career stage (ESI), from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, or new to HIV science;
2) Provide access to and consult on laboratory assays and instruments; 3) Enable studies in animal and ex
vivo tissue models of HIV infection and treatment; 4) Encourage the use of specimen and data repositories, in
a joint effort with the Clinical and Comorbidity Research (CCR) Core. We will assess our impact with these
aims by rigorously collecting metrics of our success, which will include demographic data to verify that we are
increasing user diversity over time. Most importantly, over the 5-year period of this award, we strive to increase
the scientific impact of the IRC Core, as measured by research reports published with our support and
HIV/AIDS-focused grants received by our users."

Structural and institutional discrimination create inequities in opportunities and resources needed for HIV
prevention and treatment, contributing to pervasive HIV disparities in key populations, which have persisted
since the early years of the HIV epidemic. As individuals with marginalized identities encounter significant
barriers to accessing HIV-related services due to the intersectional nature of systemic discrimination, bias, and
racism in the US and globally, there is an evident need for increased research and attention on addressing HIV
related disparities in historically disadvantaged groups. The proposed Health Equity Scientific Working Group
(SWG) will catalyze efforts to investigate and understand the complex social and structural determinants of
health disparities and to promote innovative research to attain health equity and remove sources of unfair health
differences among historically marginalized populations. Our Steering Committee and the CFAR EDI Director
will help to guide our work. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Create a hub for community-engaged,
interdisciplinary collaborations that will generate key data and conduct analyses that elucidate
characteristics of HIV-related health disparities; 2) Promote and support interdisciplinary teams that
include community partners and academic researchers to develop research agendas that advance
community-engaged, health equity-focused HIV research at our CFAR; and 3) Develop research
proposals that advance the achievement of health equity in HIV prevention and treatment among health-
disparities populations with attention to the Pacific Northwest region. For Aim 1, we will conduct monthly
works-in-progress meetings that will convene a multidisciplinary group of researchers, including early career and
underrepresented individuals, to facilitate collaborations that will contribute to data generation and analyses that
elucidate characteristics of HIV-related health disparities. For Aim 2, we will convene community meet and
greets developed in partnership with the UW/FH CFAR Office of Community Engagement (OCE) to foster
collaborations for researchers and community members to develop health-equity related research projects. For
Aim 3, guest speakers will provide expert perspectives on select health equity-related research topics to support
development of successful research proposals that will advance the achievement of health equity in HIV
prevention and treatment. The Health Equity SWG presents an important opportunity to bring established and
new investigators and community members together to strengthen and promote equity-focused research
programs and provide scientific leadership in the area of health equity. The SWG will contribute to the strengths
and interdisciplinary expertise of the UW/FH CFAR through its integration of community partnerships and
multidisciplinary collaborations. Through the proposed activities, the SWG will expand current research
approaches to build upon what we know about health disparities to eliminate barriers to achieving equity in
access and utilization of HIV prevention and care."

The Substance Use Scientific Working Group (SU SWG) is proposed to stimulate interdisciplinary scientific
collaboration to investigate the intersection of substance use and HIV, an area that is critical to address to end
the national and global HIV epidemics. There is renewed interest and urgency to enhance research on substance
use and HIV, in part due to the opioid crisis being associated with HIV outbreaks in parts of the US, including
Seattle, and increasing rates of methamphetamine use, being associated with high-risk sex. Furthermore,
substance use still strongly drives disruptions and disparities in the HIV care continuum, including continuation
in HIV care and adherence to ART which are needed for “treatment as prevention”. The SU SWG will bring
together CFAR investigators from varied backgrounds with a shared interest in tackling the unique issues facing
persons with substance use disorders living with, or at risk for, HIV, particularly people who inject drugs (PWID)
who are a key vulnerable population. The SU SWG addresses a key NIH HIV priority area furthering “research
that examines health and social issues, such as other infectious or non-infectious conditions and substance use
or mental health disorders”. We will support research to understand current patterns of substance and
polysubstance use, including opioids, stimulants, sedatives, cannabis, alcohol, and nicotine, among persons
living with HIV and those at risk of acquiring HIV, and to elucidate how they impact HIV disease transmission
and outbreaks. We will also foster research to develop and test patient-centered interventions, both biomedical
and behavioral, that will prevent and/or treat HIV among persons with substance use disorders and research
that will integrate care for addictions and HIV. Our overarching goal is to bring together a multi-disciplinary
community of researchers dedicated to advancing the research agenda for substance use and HIV prevention,
treatment, and cure. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) create and support a multi-disciplinary network of UW
researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise to develop substance use research and receive
critical feedback on projects and grants. 2) cultivate new skills and knowledge related to substance use
and HIV research among early stage investigators and those new to HIV or substance use research,
particularly those from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. We will leverage and create
multidisciplinary collaborations between diverse researchers on substance use at our CFAR, support monthly
work-in-progress meetings, and host an annual workshop for skills development specific to the intersection
between substance use and HIV. Our efforts will include a focused effort to support early stage investigators.
This work will be done in collaboration with the CFAR Office of Community Engagement to ensure that
community priorities are addressed. With this new SWG, we will leverage the substantial momentum building
around research on HIV prevention and improved HIV care for persons with substance use and use disorders to
position our CFAR to be a leader in the field of substance use and HIV."
10925327,"Cancer nano-formulations for delivery of small molecule drugs are limited by the ability to target only ~10%
of the genome. RNAi molecules can, in theory, be designed against any gene of interest, but siRNA use in clinical
oncology faces delivery barriers such as nuclease degradation, rapid renal clearance, poor distribution into tumor
tissues, and poor cell membrane penetration. To overcome these challenges, most RNAi therapies focus on
synthetic lipo- and poly-plex nano-formulations. Unfortunately, while these technologies typically achieve very
high delivery into the liver, high-penetrance siRNA tumor delivery remains elusive.
 The overarching goal of this project is to develop siRNA chemical modifications that provide potent, safe,
tumor-penetrating, and molecularly targeted nano-therapeutics against currently undruggable tumor drivers. The
approach builds upon our recently published proof of principle siRNA molecules end-modified through a PEG45
linker with a diacyl lipid (siRNA-EG45<L2), which forms a nano-complex with albumin (alb-NC) in situ following
intravenous injection. This albumin “hitchhiking” siRNA-EG45<L2 enhances siRNA pharmacokinetic properties, is
very safe, provides natural tumor tropism, and increases tumor delivery level, homogeneity of tumor delivery,
and tumor:liver delivery ratio compared to conventional nano-polyplexes formed with in vivo-jetPEI (PEI-NPs).
The alb-NCs especially outperformed PEI-NPs for accumulating within challenging patient derived xenograft
(PDX) tumors that have reduced access to delivery by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.
 The specific goal of this proposal is to further explore and optimize siRNA chemical modifications for in
situ formation of effective alb-NCs. We will benchmark new candidates against conventional nano-formulations
in simple (xenograft), immune-competent (allograft) and rigorous (PDX and spontaneous) tumor models. This
platform will be validated for silencing of the oncogene myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) to treat triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Mcl-1 is a vetted target with relevance in a broad range of cancers, supporting its use for
proof-of-concept. Furthermore, TNBC is a highly aggressive clinical breast cancer subtype with few treatment
options. TNBC patients are currently relegated to chemotherapies, and do not typically benefit from molecularly-
targeted therapies.
 This project is uniquely accessible by our multi-PI interdisciplinary team with bioengineering expertise in
intracellular biologic drug delivery nanotechnologies (Duvall), chemical synthesis (Uddin), analysis of noncoding
RNA transport on serum components (Vickers), Mcl-1 pathway modulation and analysis (Cook), and cutting
edge preclinical models, including PDX, for testing experimental therapies (Brantley-Sieders). Our basic
science expertise will be supplemented by consultation with Dr. Ingrid Mayer, a medical oncologist involved in
breast cancer clinical trials at Vanderbilt. This group will enable previously inaccessible investigations toward
development of more effective, tumor-penetrating, and molecularly-targeted TNBC therapeutics."
10906749,"ABSTRACT
An estimated 13 million preterm births (PTBs) occur annually worldwide and PTB is the single most significant
contributing factor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. The inability to correctly identify patients at risk for PTB
limits efficient research progress by preventing assembly of cohorts actually at risk for the disease and leaves
major research investments with heterogenous cohorts, modest or conflicting effects of interventions tested, and
unclear clinical translation. Current PTB prediction is applied according to two primary risk factors: 1) prior PTB
and 2) short cervical length on ultrasound. These two risk criteria are particularly problematic in nulliparous
patients because they have no obstetric history to guide risk stratification, and cervical length has poor predictive
ability. In fact, in a 2021 American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology practice bulletin on PTB prevention,
the authors concluded that “whether and how to screen nulliparous women is a matter of uncertainty and debate.”
Cervical tissue elastography is a promising technique to measure cervical remodeling. However, current systems
are unable to quantify the pressure applied to the cervix, making the measurement non-quantitative and thereby
preventing standardization between examiners, longitudinal within-patient comparisons, and between-patient
comparisons. We have overcome this key limitation with a novel, precise, operator-independent, ultrasound-
based imaging modality—fully quantitative cervical elastography system (Q-CES). Our preliminary data
shows that 1) cervical stiffness, detectable by Q-CES in early pregnancy, is significantly associated with
spontaneous PTB, and 2) Q-CES may have stronger predictive utility for spontaneous PTB than cervical length.
The aims of this proposal will test the overall hypothesis that Q-CES values of cervical stiffness can more
accurately predict spontaneous PTB than cervical length using a multicenter, diverse prospective cohort. In Aim
1 we will, for the first time, quantify normative Q-CES values of cervical stiffness in nulliparous patients who
deliver at term versus preterm. In Aim 2 we will use Q-CES to develop a multiparametric risk prediction model
for spontaneous PTB compared to existing models based on cervical length.
We have an established, multidisciplinary team already performing Q-CES at all three centers in this proposal,
with equipment in place and ready to be leveraged for this project. We will enroll 35% Black and Hispanic patients
to ensure that our results can explore the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in PTB risk. Completion of these
aims will allow us to, for the first time, numerically quantify cervical tissue stiffness longitudinally in pregnancy
and to detect softening patterns predictive of spontaneous PTB. This will be directly clinically actionable and
address a fundamental roadblock in PTB science by improving the ability to assemble rational research cohorts
for more meaningful testing of known and as-yet-undeveloped PTB prevention strategies."
10840895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The main goal of this grant application is to target circadian rhythm for perioperative cardioprotection.
Perioperative myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and infarction continue to be major causes of morbidity
and mortality in surgical patients. However, percutaneous coronary intervention in combination with
anticoagulation and platelet inhibitors may be unsuitable in the perioperative setting due to the risk of bleeding
from the surgical site. Finding novel pharmacologic or interventional strategies to render the myocardium more
resistant to the deleterious effects of myocardial IRI would be highly significant for perioperative and critical care
medicine. Previous studies indicate that the occurrence of myocardial IRI follows a circadian pattern which could
be linked to an interaction between circadian rhythm and hypoxia signaling. Thus, the current application is
focused on identifying circadian mechanisms that could be targeted therapeutically to dampen myocardial IRI.
 To study the circadian control of myocardial IRI, we established a murine model of in situ myocardial IRI and
found the smallest infarct sizes at zeitgeber time (ZT) 8 (3 pm), and largest infarct sizes at ZT 20 (3 am).
Subsequent unbiased RNA sequencing of the area at risk from the left ventricle of mice exposed to myocardial
IRI at ZT8 versus ZT20 pointed us toward the core circadian transcription factor - Bmal1. Similarly, RNA-seq
data from left ventricular biopsies of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the morning versus afternoon groups
confirmed BMAL1 as the most differentially expressed gene. In functional studies, using transgenic mice with
myocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 (Bmal1loxp/loxp Myosin Cre+ mice), we observed complete blunting of the
cardioprotective effect at ZT8. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry identified hypoxia-
inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF2A) as a binding partner for BMAL1. Similar to Bmal1loxp/loxp Myosin Cre+ mice, we
observed abolished cardioprotection at ZT8 in Hif2aloxp/loxp Myosin Cre+ mice. Subsequent biochemical and
biophysical studies revealed a direct interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A showing a 4.5 Å electron density
map of the BMAL1/HIF2A heterodimer in complex with hypoxia-response element (HRE) DNA. Finally, we
identified amphiregulin (AREG) as a critical transcriptional co-target for BMAL1/HIF2A heterodimer in mediating
circadian-dependent cardioprotection. Thus, we hypothesize that BMAL1 and HIF2A form a transcriptionally
active complex critical in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection via daytime-dependent
regulation of AREG. We propose three Specific Aims to address this hypothesis: (1) Characterize the interaction
between BMAL1 and HIF2A and their functional roles during hypoxia in vitro or myocardial IRI in vivo. (2) Study
the co-target gene of BMAL1/HIF2A – AREG in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection. (3) Target
BMAL1/HIF2A for cardioprotection and proof-of-principle studies during perioperative myocardial IRI."

 PARP inhibitor (PARPi) use in the clinic is expanding into multiple cancer types, and consequently,
PARPi resistance is a growing clinical problem. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tumors and cells
remain an optimal model system to assess PARPi response and resistance. We have developed a panel of
unique isogenic PARPi sensitive and resistance HGSOC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models. We published that hyperactivation of the Wnt/-catenin pathway promotes PARPi resistance. Through
the current literature and our preliminary investigation, we have discovered that Wnt-mediated PARPi resistant
HGSOC cells have increased expression of the immune checkpoint, PD-L1, and reduced expression of the
tumor suppressor, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Further, Wnt/-catenin signaling directly inhibits
effector T cell differentiation and promotes a tumor-promoting, M2-like macrophage. We will continue to
collaborate with MD2 Biosciences to investigate a first-in-class allosteric -catenin inhibitor, 1525. We
hypothesize that Wnt-dependent PARPi resistance inhibits anti-tumor immunity, and combining ICB with Wnt
inhibition will promote immune activation to eradicate PARPi resistant HGSOC. We are proposing to use
both in vitro and in vivo models to determine the role of PARPi resistance and Wnt signaling in promoting an
immune-suppressive environment. In Aim 1, we will use our unique PARPi resistant cell line models to
establish -catenin regulation of PD-L1 (gene – CD274) and IRF1. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
secreted factors from PARPi resistant cells attenuates T cell activation and promotes macrophage M2
differentiation. In Aim 3, we will use our novel syngeneic and humanized mouse models to assess the 1525 -
catenin inhibitor combined with anti-PD-1. The proposed work has the potential for a high impact on
understanding ovarian cancer biology and improving therapeutic options. We anticipate combining -catenin
inhibition with an immune checkpoint blocker will overcome PARPi resistance and provide a therapeutic option
for those who are no longer responding to PARP inhibitors. Thus, the proposed work's long-term goal is to
develop an investigator-initiated clinical trial at the University of Colorado."

Project Summary
 Metastatic melanomas are aggressive tumors that respond poorly to chemotherapy and radiation and
promptly acquire resistance to targeted therapy. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can induce
sustained melanoma remission, nearly half of patients are intrinsically resistant to ICIs, in part because their
tumors are too large to be cleared by the immune system or are immunologically “cold” and lack immune
recognition necessary to generate anti-tumor T effector cells. Our preliminary data show that senescence-
inducing therapy enhances melanoma-cell intrinsic pro-inflammatory program driven by transcription factor NF-
κB. We identified the RIG-I-Like Receptor (RLR) pathway as a candidate NF-κB inducer. This pro-inflammatory
program involves enhanced antigen presentation and secretion of chemokines that recruit antigen-presenting
cells into the tumor. We also found that senescent cells overexpress checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and Galectin
9, which can inhibit T cells by binding their inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3, respectively. This suggests
that senescence-inducing therapy can enhance recognition of tumor antigens while targeting senescence-
specific immune checkpoints can promote adoptive T cell responses against these antigens.
 Despite its immunogenic properties, therapeutic application of senescence-inducing agents is complicated
by the reports that persistent senescent cells may promote tumor metastasis, relapse, and chemo-resistance.
Here we hypothesize that we can safely improve melanoma immunogenicity by inducing tumor cell
senescence for a limited time, followed by elimination of persistent senescent cells using senolytic drugs that
specifically kill senescent cells. This novel therapeutic approach is expected to be effective by: 1) directly
blocking tumor cell growth and survival, 2) activating RLR-mediated tumor cell intrinsic immuno-stimulatory
signals, and 3) making tumor cells vulnerable to inhibitors of PD-L1/PD1 and Galectin 9/TIM3 immune
checkpoints. Three specific aims will examine these mechanisms. In the first aim we will establish the optimal
dosing schedule for combined senescence-inducing and senolytic therapy and determine the direct anti-tumor
efficacy in an immune-deficient mouse model. A pre-clinical trial using our extensively characterized melanoma
PDXs will be conducted to estimate response rate to senescence-inducing and senolytic drug combinations
and to identify response-predictive biomarkers. Second aim will investigate the mechanisms whereby
senescence-inducing and senolytic therapy facilitates the innate immune sensing of tumor focusing on the role
of RLRs. We will examine whether deficiency in RLR signaling can abrogate NF-κB activation, chemokine
secretion, and immune cell recruitment into senescent tumors. Aim three will determine if senescence-inducing
and senolytic therapy augments immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responses. We will utilize anti-PD-L1 and
anti-TIM3 agents to target senescence-cell specific immune checkpoints. These studies will provide a
preclinical basis for clinical development of rational combinations of senescence-inducing and senolytic agents.

10658491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint pathway, consisting of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on T cells, and its ligand
PD-L1 on tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), is a major mechanism for tumors to escape immune
attack. Blocking antibodies of PD-1 and PD-L1 have demonstrated unprecedented clinical activities against an
array of human cancers, yet durable benefit is limited to a small subset of patients. Expanding the clinical benefit
to a larger population of patients has met critical challenges due to our incomplete understanding of the PD-
L1/PD-1 pathway and how their blockade antibodies work. Our long-term goal is to fill these mechanistic gaps
through the use of novel, unique and robust approaches. We recently uncovered two novel aspects of PD-L1/PD-
1 signaling. Intracellularly, we showed that the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target of PD-1
associated phosphatases. Extracellularly, we discovered that PD-L1 can be neutralized in cis by PD-1 expressed
on the same cells, i.e., APCs. In this proposal, we will integrate and extend these two prior findings to elucidate
a poorly defined extracellular crosstalk between PD-L1/PD-1 and CD28 pathways. Our preliminary experiments
revealed that the CD28 ligand B7.1 binds and neutralizes PD-L1 in cis, but not in trans. Guided by this new
finding, we propose to pursue three specific aims to determine the biochemical and functional consequences of
the B7.1/PD-L1 cis-interaction and how this interaction might underlie unreported mechanisms of actions for PD-
L1 and PD-1 blockade antibodies. In Aim-1, we will determine whether B7.1 neutralizes the ability of PD-L1 to
bind and activate PD-1 through cis-interaction. In Aim-2, we will ask the reciprocal question of whether cis-PD-
L1 inhibits the ability of B7.1 to bind and activate CD28. In Aim-3, we will use well-defined co-culture assays and
mouse tumor models to determine the effects of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade antibodies in the context of B7.1/PD-
L1 cis-interaction. The key for achieving these goals is to decouple and quantitate cis and trans interaction at
the cell-cell interface. To this end, we plan to integrate classical approaches and our recently developed
membrane reconstitution, live cell imaging (TIRF) and cell-specific antibody blockade assays. Completion of the
project will reveal in-depth insights into the regulatory mechanism of the PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint axis,
its crosstalk with the B7/CD28 pathway, and the mechanism of actions of therapeutic antibodies. These
mechanistic insights will likely yield novel targets and biomarkers of PD-1 targeted cancer immunotherapy."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant
exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment,
structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child
development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of
life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To
accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed
to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented
by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the
United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-
NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be
placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco
and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a
racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2)
pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3)
demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal
inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and
protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-
modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide
novel insights into child development using state-of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public
policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation."
10793593,"Abstract
Glucose metabolism generates important signals that regulate several facets of β-cell health, including insulin
secretion, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. We have found that the TCA cycle enzyme pyruvate
carboxylase (PC), which promotes metabolic signals that regulate insulin secretion, has previously
unappreciated roles in β-cell stress mitigation by promoting urea cycle activity and de novo glutathione (GSH)
synthesis. These PC-directed pathways can promote a dual defense mechanism, whereby nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis from arginine is reduced as arginine is utilized for ureagenesis and antioxidant capacity is increased
by de novo GSH synthesis in the face of diabetes-related stress stimuli. Both pathways receive input from
glucose through PC activity and are modulated by phosphorylation of BAD, a GK binding and activating protein
that drives a broad β-cell protective program.
This renewal application addresses key questions that stem from these findings: What are the molecular
mechanistic components of this PC-driven β-cell protective program and how do they contribute to β-
cell mass dynamics? We will address these questions in two aims. First, we will dissect the downstream
effectors of the urea cycle pathway that are required for β-cell protection. Our prediction is that beyond changing
the balance between urea and NO production, urea cycle activation provides biosynthetic intermediates that
promote growth, including ornithine and polyamines. We will also examine how glucose is connected to these
pathways using metabolomics and metabolic tracing studies combined with genetic and pharmacologic
perturbations of these pathways. Similarly, we will examine the route for glucose to GSH synthesis and how this
antioxidant mechanism factors into PC-mediated protection. We will then test the relevance of these pathways
in protecting donor islets in a marginal mass islet transplantation model (Aim 1). Second, we will test the
contributions of these pathways to β-cell mass adaptation in response to high fat diet (HFD) using two
complementary approaches; a β-cell-specific PC knockout mouse model treated with HFD and assessing the
response of donor islet grafts to (HFD) treatment of transplanted mice (Aim 2).
These studies will provide an integrated picture of the pathways connecting phospho-BAD, GK and PC activation
to β-cell stress response and adaptation. In the fullness of time, understanding these connections will yield
valuable insights into the most effective strategies to capture and mimic the protective aspects of glucose
signaling for preservation/restoration of functional β-cell mass."

We seek to develop a new class of drugs for RAS-MAPK driven cancers by targeting the interfacial binding
sites of key regulatory complexes within the cascade. By moving away from conventional active site-based
drugs, we have the potential for a unique class of compounds with advantages in terms of selectivity, target
engagement, therapeutic index, and combinatorial activity to mitigate the emergence of drug resistance.
The MAPK/ERK Kinase (MEK) MEK is a shared effector of KRAS and BRAF, which are among the most
frequently mutated oncogenes and protein kinases across all human cancers. As such, MEK has long been
pursued as a drug target in oncology, and more recently in immunotherapy and aging. However, many drugs
that target MEK are limited due to on-target associated toxicities and drug resistance. Accordingly, a
molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a
template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. My laboratory has made initial steps in this
direction through the determination of X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the RAF paralog Kinase
Suppressor of Ras (KSR), and in complex with various MEKi, including the first ever co-crystal structures
bound to the clinical drug trametinib (Khan et al., Nature, 2020). Unlike most targeted therapies, trametinib was
serendipitously identified through phenotypic screens, and X-ray crystal structures had been lacking. Our novel
structural and functional insights have revealed an unexpected mode of binding in which the inhibitor pocket for
trametinib is formed through the interface between MEK and KSR, revealing KSR as a direct co-receptor of the
drug and trametinib as an ‘interfacial binder’. Moreover, our studies suggest that the unique therapeutic
properties of trametinib derive from the ability of the drug to bind at the interface of the complex. Building from
these insights, we have developed a tool compound, trametiglue, with enhanced interfacial binding properties
and several novel pharmacological features, including unprecedented potency and an ability to overcome a
common resistance mechanism to trametinib and other clinical MEKi. This proposal focuses on developing an
advanced set of analogs through structure-based design and synthesis. Our targets include advanced
trametiglue analogs, including paralog-selective molecular glues to target individual MAPK signaling
complexes that have been implicated in RAS-MAPK driven cancers and sensitivity to currently available drugs
(Aim 1). In vivo target engagement and optimization of drug-like properties with this expanded set of analogs
(Aim 2). Testing in preclinical cancer models, including patient derived organoids and xenografts (Aim 3).
There are over 5 million individuals diagnosed globally with RAS-MAPK driven cancers on a yearly basis.
Despite recent therapeutic breakthroughs with, for example KRAS-G12C and BRAF-V600E inhibitors, over
90% of RAS-MAPK tumors are unactionable. Advances in this proposal will lead to next generation drugs and
a new therapeutic modality for selectively antagonizing RAS-MAPK driven malignancies in patients."
10884309,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Celiac disease (CeD) is a complex intestinal inflammatory disorder that is triggered by dietary gluten and
develops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. 1% of the
worldwide population is affected by this disease for which the only effective treatment is a lifelong and
restrictive gluten-free diet (GFD). Yet, persistent symptoms and enteropathy remain commonplace even
among CeD patients that adhere to a GFD. This stresses the need to develop non-dietary interventions for
CeD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete
understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying CeD pathogenesis and the lack of a suitable mouse
model. CeD is characterized by the loss of oral tolerance to gluten manifested by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8-
restricted anti-gluten inflammatory CD4 T cells in the small intestinal mucosa and by a massive expansion of
cytotoxic intraepithelial CD8+ lymphocytes (IE-CTLs) that are involved in the killing of intestinal epithelial cells.
These observations have led to the general idea that CeD is primarily a T cell-mediated immune disorder. We
hypothesize, however, that B cells also play a critical role. This hypothesis stems from several observations.
First, CeD is characterized by a considerable expansion of plasma cells in the mucosa of CeD patients as well
as the development of anti-deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) antibodies and autoantibodies against the
enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Second, the main model to explain the production of anti-DGP and
anti-TG2 antibodies is that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells provide help to B cells suggesting that B cells could act
as antigen-presenting cells for T cells and promote the amplification of the anti-gluten CD4 T cell response.
Finally, several case reports on patients having CeD associated with another autoimmune disease suggest
that B cell depletion therapy can provide clinical benefit in CeD, and we have demonstrated that B cell
depletion significantly reduces intestinal tissue damage in our mouse model of CeD. The objective of this
application is to characterize in vivo the role of B cells in amplifying the anti-gluten T cell response and allow it
to reach a sufficient magnitude to promote tissue destruction. This project is innovative as it employs unique
mouse models of CeD allowing to manipulate B lymphocytes, gluten-specific T cells, the gluten antigen, and
the CeD predisposing HLA molecule to 1) assess the contribution of B cells as antigen-presenting to the
activation and amplification of the anti-gluten CD4+ T cell response, and 2) assess the role of B cells and
antibodies in the activation of IE-CTLs and tissue destruction. The knowledge gained from this study will
provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms by which B cell-mediated immunity contribute to the
pathogenesis of CeD and will assess for the first time the therapeutic potential of B cell depletion therapy in an
experimental mouse model of CeD."

Lipid and cholesterol-rich Western diet is a major risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, including
cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A common
lipid derivative associated with the pathogenesis of these inflammatory and metabolic diseases is low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) which is scavenged by its receptor (LDLR) expressed in almost all tissue. Despite the known function
of LDL in atherosclerosis, its role in other diseases is poorly understood. Inflammation is a common trigger for
atherosclerosis and other non-communicable diseases. However, whether native LDL, which is the most abundant
physiological form of LDL, is involved in the inflammatory response is unknown.
The goal of this study is to define a role of native LDL in inflammatory response, so the association of LDL with many
human diseases can be explained. This critically important objective was stemmed from our preliminary studies in
which we observed that mice having high blood LDL are highly susceptible to experimental colitis. Interestingly, mice
defective in LDLR (Ldlr-/-) were relatively protective against colitis. Reduced colitis susceptibility of Ldlr-/- mice was
associated with suppressed inflammation and decreased activation of inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-
kB and MAPK, pointing to an uncharacterized function of LDL/LDLR in inflammation. Indeed, we observed that native
LDL stimulates macrophages in vitro to produce inflammatory molecules. Given that no study yet documented a role
of native LDL in innate immune signaling and inflammatory responses, our observation underscored a novel
mechanism of pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders associated with high blood LDL. We, therefore, hypothesize
that endocytosis of LDL through LDLR induces inflammatory responses in myeloid cells causing inflammation, and
such an inflammatory pathway imparts a major contribution in inflammatory disorders like colitis. This hypothesis will
be tested through two specific aims: Aim 1. To dissect the pathway involved in LDL-mediated induction of
inflammatory responses; Aim 2. To define the role of native LDL and its receptor in intestinal inflammation. Using
biochemical and molecular biology techniques, we will explore signaling events and mechanisms involved in
LDL/LDLR-mediated activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways. We will use Ldlr-/- mice and mouse models of colitis
to investigate the in vivo relevance of LDL/LDLR in inflammatory disorders.
Overall, this study will explore a novel biological function of native LDL which will help elucidate the pathogenic
mechanism of diseases associated with high blood LDL. Furthermore, this study will decipher a yet unknown role of
blood LDL in colitis pathogenesis. The findings of this study will open the opportunity to treat IBD and other non-
communicable diseases by targeting LDL synthesis or LDLR downstream signaling pathways."

Pediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) carries a high risk of cardiovascular disease mediated
by chronic inflammation and premature atherosclerosis, but responsive surrogate outcome measures of
cardiovascular (CV) risk are currently lacking. Loss of nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) decline by ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is common in children with pSLE, and has potential as an early, modifiable,
non-invasive measure of vascular health. Loss of NBP decline predicts CV events in adults and may be a
marker of endothelial dysfunction, which precedes structural changes in atherosclerosis. More importantly,
cardiovascular risk associated with NBP decline is potentially reversible with renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)
blockade. In order to determine the role of NBP decline as an outcome measure in pSLE, this proposal seeks
to first understand which mechanisms of increased cardiovascular risk contribute to loss of NBP decline, and
how NBP decline relates to endothelial function or other measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. Responsive
outcome measures would enable studies of interventions to improve vascular health. Potential pharmacologic
interventions include RAS blockade, which targets endothelial function without increasing infections from
immune suppression. There is, however, a paucity of data to guide the use of RAS blockade in pSLE.
 The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) identify the major factors that contribute to loss of NBP decline
in pSLE; 2) determine whether loss of NBP decline is associated with endothelial dysfunction and could serve
as a CV risk marker or potential treatment target; and 3) determine whether RAS blockade is associated with a
decreased risk of CV events in adolescents or young adults with SLE. We will perform a prospective
longitudinal study of children with SLE recruited to undergo serial ABPM, peripheral endothelial function testing
and comprehensive vascular profiles. We will also perform a retrospective analysis using advanced
pharmacoepidemiologic methods to estimate the effect of RAS blockade on the risk of cardiovascular events
among adolescents and adults in a large electronic health record database.
 K23 Candidate Dr. Chang completed a Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn) and has been appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP). The proposed research and training plan will provide her with the necessary experience
conducting prospective patient-oriented research, expand her expertise in non-invasive vascular assessment
and cardiovascular outcomes research, and provide advanced training in pharmacoepidemiologic methods, to
become an expert in early identification and prevention of cardiovascular complications of child-onset
rheumatic disease. She has established a strong multidisciplinary mentoring team that, together with the vast
resources at CHOP and UPenn, will facilitate the proposed work and foster her development as an
independent investigator and leader at the cross-section of cardiology and pediatric rheumatology."

Over the last decade Chimeric Antigen Receptor based T cell therapy (CAR-T) has developed into an effective
immunotherapy for some cancers. However, CAR-T cell therapies have several shortcomings and clinical
success has primarily been limited to hematological cancers. Challenges of CAR-T cell therapy include tumor
immune evasion through loss of target antigen expression by tumor cells and inhibition of CAR-T cell function
by tumor expressed inhibitory molecules. Natural killer (NK) cells present an alternative to T cells that could be
more effective due to their ability to perform both antigen dependent and independent killing. NK cells have
demonstrated antigen specific killing when engineered to express T cell CARs and NK cells also mediate the
direct killing of transformed cells with reduced or absent MHC expression. In fact, NK cells carry out antibody
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ACDD) of cells that bind antibodies via the NK cell CD16A receptor. Due
to the multiple modalities for cancer cell killing, there is an increased interest in NK cells for cancer
immunotherapy. As NK cells are not associated with graft versus host disease, neurotoxicity, long-term
autoimmunity, nor cytokine release syndrome, they are more suited for use in allogeneic settings than T cells
and have significant clinical potential for use as off-the-shelf products. However, previous publications and
clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of unmanipulated NK cells to treat cancer is minimally effective,
likely due to limited engraftment, little in vivo expansion, and suppression by the tumor microenvironment. NK
cells activated and expanded with feeder cells expressing membrane bound interleukin-21 (mbIL-21) have
shown promising results clinically with high-risk myeloid malignancies and preclinically in several solid tumor
models. Therefore, we hypothesize that activated/expanded NK cells that have be genetically edited can be
used to successfully treat osteosarcoma, a disease for which patient outcome has not improved in over thirty
years. Our proposed objectives are to evaluate the baseline response of rested- and activated-NK cells against
various osteosarcoma cell lines, knockout negative regulators of NK cell function (specifically, c-CBL, IL-1R8,
and SMAD3), and implement a specific CAR that optimally activates NK cell antigen-specific killing. Genetically
engineered NK cells will be evaluated for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and safety in osteosarcoma models.
Our preliminary data strongly supports the hypothesis that NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy can be fully
realized using activated, genome engineered NK cells."
10843278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence suggests robustness of transcriptional regulation, yet human genetic studies indicate
phenotypic sensitivity to transcription factor (TF) dosage in both complex traits and rare disorders, motivating
quantitative studies of TF dosage effects. These features are exemplified by the development of the human
face, which is frequently disrupted in a range of syndromes with typical features. The aim of this proposal is
to develop and apply tools to precisely modulate dosage of craniofacial TFs in cranial neural crest cells, the
progenitors of the face, and assess effects across multiple biological levels – molecular, cellular, and
morphological. The proposal initially focuses on SOX9, using diverse approaches to understand the rules
that determine which regulatory elements and genes are sensitive to SOX9 dosage (Aim 1), as well as their
phenotypic consequences (Aim 2). Then, such rules will be generalized to five additional craniofacial TFs
(Aim 3) and used to dissect mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with craniofacial
morphology or disease (Aim 4). These studies will reveal drivers of craniofacial morphological and disease
variation, provide general insights into transcriptional regulation, and help transform our approach to
studying TF function, from binary to quantitative in nature.
The proposed research, along with a comprehensive plan for my career development, combines my scientific
background and postdoctoral training in functional genomics, gene regulation, and human genetics with
opportunities for additional training in machine learning, mouse genetics, and morphological analysis. I will
be mentored by Drs. Joanna Wysocka and Jonathan Pritchard in a vibrant scientific environment (Stanford
Chemical and Systems Biology) and receive additional training from my advisory committee of Drs. James
Ferrell, Anshul Kundaje, and Benedikt Hallgrimsson.
My transition to independence will be facilitated by participation in both scientific and non-scientific trainings
and workshops, as well as experience in presenting my work at scientific conferences. I will also gain
experience mentoring students and technicians, and will hone my grant management and writing skills.
Collectively, my mentors have guided over 25 of their former postdocs to independent academic research
positions, and they will provide practical advice and feedback during my faculty job search.
My long-term career goal is to direct an independent research program aimed at understanding the
molecular underpinnings of quantitative variation in craniofacial morphology and disease risk. So far I have
achieved significant progress towards this goal through my research experience, publications, and
engagement with the broader scientific community. I firmly believe, however, that a K99 mentored phase
will maximize my chances for success by providing access to key resources and training that would be
otherwise lacking from my postdoctoral experience."

undergraduate students in STEM research and increase the number of such students going onto doctoral
programs and careers in biomedical sciences research.
 The ODU U-RISE program has four specific aims: (1) To recruit five cohorts of 6 juniors (steady state of 12
trainees) and 16 pre-U-RISE trainees (8 freshmen and 8 sophomores) from groups underrepresented in
biomedical sciences, (2) To incorporate changes in U-RISE based on what we learned in the current MARC
program and deliver a comprehensive support system to guide trainees through the two-year program, (3) To
ensure that the U-RISE program is a rigorous academic and research-training program that prepares trainees
for the challenges of graduate education, and (4) To ensure that trainees develop the communication,
presentation, and networking skills required for a successful biomedical research career
 The pre-U-RISE trainees will be assigned to faculty mentors for guidance and retention. They will be engaged
in mentored hands-on laboratory research experience and attend all U-RISE activities. They will apply to the U-
RISE program and be selected based on their academic record and performance in the U-RISE activities.
 The program activities will include advanced instruction in software, programming, laboratory equipment,
critical thinking, literature analysis, and professional development targeted specifically toward application to
biomedical and behavioral Ph.D. programs. Responsible Conduct of Research training will be provided. The
trainees will receive intensive training in presentation skills and scientific writing, ultimately resulting in
presentation of their work at regional and national conferences, as well as publications in peer-reviewed journals.
Further, they will be provided mentorship on the Graduate Record Examination preparation, graduate school
preparation, and how to successfully compete for graduate fellowships. The U-RISE trainees will perform their
research both in the laboratories of ODU mentors, as well as in laboratories of external collaborators at T32
funded universities and other biomedical research-intensive institutions.
 The Program Director will share administrative leadership responsibilities with a Co-Director and additional
departmental liaison faculty members from the Colleges of Sciences, Engineering, and Health Sciences. A
Program Manager will oversee day-to-day operations. Internal and external evaluators will assess the program
execution process and its results. An Advisory Committee will provide oversight and feedback.
 Strong institutional support for the ODU U-RISE program is demonstrated through the letter of support
from the Provost and the President."

The public at large has grown keenly aware of the effects of environmental toxins on the developing body. Briefly,
exposure to toxicants frequently induces changes in inflammatory activity in the body. That inflammation can
spread systemically and impact multiple organ systems, including the brain. Chronic inflammation, even at low-
grade levels, has been linked to negative mental and cognitive health outcomes, including aberrations in the
development of neural circuitry and the onset and progression of psychological symptoms and disorders.
Knowing the potential effects of such toxins, one surprisingly common, but rarely studied environmental toxin is
radon. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that accumulates in homes and poses significant health
risks, including increased risk of developing certain cancers, and damage to developmentally sensitive tissues
and organs through accentuated inflammatory processes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency
set the action limit for home radon concentrations at 4 pCi/L, which is the carcinogenic equivalent of smoking 10
cigarettes per day. An astonishing 1 in 15 homes across the country is expected to have radon concentrations
at or above the set action limit, leaving a large number of youths across the country chronically exposed to high
levels of radon. However, studies linking radon toxicity to altered neural and cognitive development are extremely
sparse. The current proposal aims to address this critical gap in knowledge by examining the impact of radon
exposure on inflammatory activity, neural circuitry, and cognitive and mental health function. Our groundbreaking
preliminary work is the first to show robust links between chronic radon exposure and specific inflammatory
activity, coupled with deficits in high order cognition and increased depressive symptomologies. We have also
found evidence that radon exposure is associated with aberrant neural dynamics in a network of frontoparietal
regions that have been commonly implicated in cognitive and emotional control. In the current multimodal
neuroimaging study, we will quantify the impact of home radon exposure on inflammatory processes, and
whether such inflammation has a mediating role on functioning in the distinct neural circuits implicated in emotion
regulation and higher order cognition. To this end,a cohort of adolescents will undergo magnetoencephalography
(MEG) during a battery of tasks designed to assess multiple neural systems serving cognitive and emotional
control. Youths will also complete assessments targeting cognitive and mental health, and provide blood samples
to capture measures of peripheral inflammation. Our specific aims are to 1) identify the impact of chronic radon
exposure on the neural circuitry implicated in emotional and cognitive control, and 2) quantify the mediating role
of inflammatory processes through which radon alters neural circuitry and behavioral phenotypes in youths. The
outcomes of this study have the potential to shape the future of public health policy surrounding radon awareness
and mitigation efforts, and this is especially true in the local region where home radon levels are some of the
highest in the nation."
10805479,"Human diseases are seldom confined to individual tissues or organs, but instead present with a spectrum of
comorbidities. A common example includes a group of congenital diseases with linked heart, limb, and lung
defects. Using zebrafish as model, the goal of my research is to uncover how individual causative genes drive
multi-organ comorbidities in the heart, limb, and lung. Understanding the underlying mechanisms will contribute
to the development of therapeutics across disease groups and improve predictive diagnostics of patients with
complex multi-organ diseases. In the adult body, the heart, limb, and lung vasculature seem unrelated at the
structural level, yet share a close developmental origin in the embryo. These structures all derive from
uncommitted lateral plate mesoderm that harbors progenitor cells for numerous organ systems. My overarching
hypothesis posits that the lineages of the heart, limb, and lung blood vessels (cardiopharyngeal vasculature)
derive from a common progenitor population within the lateral plate mesoderm, and form in an interconnected
manner through the action of TBX-FGF and lineage-specific signaling inputs.
 In Aim 1, I will test the lineage connection between heart, pectoral fin, and cardiopharyngeal vasculature
using transgenic lineage labeling and CRISPR-Cas9-based barcoding experiments. My work will directly test my
hypothesis that heart, limb, and lung defects are linked by a shared developmental origin of the affected cell
types. In Aim 2, I will functionally test the contribution of TBX-FGF signaling pathways, and lineage-specific
inputs on joint heart, limb, and cardiopharyngeal vasculature lineage patterning. These experiments will test the
impact of shared and lineage-specific signaling perturbation on co-occurrence and severity of heart, pectoral fin,
and cardiopharygneal vasculature defects. Upon completion of my aims I will have tested how shared lineage
origins, and perturbation of shared signaling pathways and lineage-specific inputs, contribute to human diseases
with linked heart, limb, and lung defects.
 Altogether, my proposed research aims, my technical training, and my career development plan will provide
the basis for my career goal of becoming an independent investigator at a leading research institution. During
the K99 phase, I will receive mentorship from my mentor Dr. Christian Mosimann and my advisory team, and
technical training from my collaborative team consisting of light sheet microscopy, scRNA-seq experimental
design, and cardiovascular phenotypic analysis. My career development plan will further my training in
intellectual development and collaboration, scientific writing and communication, and mentorship and teaching,
facilitating my transition to an independent investigator during the R00 phase. The section of Developmental
Biology within the Department of Pediatrics at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus is an exceptionally supportive
environment, providing extensive resources that will contribute to my continued academic success and
professional development, facilitating the accomplishment of my career goals."

Despite clear and convincing evidence for the efficacy of preventive interventions in preventing substance use
and abuse (SU/A), the public health impact of these programs has been limited by inadequate uptake in
community settings. This application seeks to train 3 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral fellows annually to
conduct research that reduces the gap between real-world practice and evidence-based preventive
interventions targeting SU/A. The proposed background is a renewal of our current NIDA-funded T32 (currently
in Year 5) and builds on a lengthy and successful 33-year history of T32 training that has been funded by
NIMH from 1987-2014 and NIDA from 2014-present. Our training program is informed by the translational
research cycle and Chambers and Proctor's recommendations on training for early career Dissemination &
Implementation (D&I) researchers. The training is housed at ASU's REACH Institute, and participating units
include the Arizona State University (ASU) Department of Psychology and School for Social and Family
Dynamics. The interdisciplinary training faculty will be drawn from these units, as well as existing collaborators
from College of Health Solutions, W.P. Carey Colleges of Business, Edson College of Nursing and Health
Innovation, Fulton Schools of Engineering, Hugh Downs School of Human Communications, School of
Criminology and Social Justice, and the School of Social Work. Training faculty conduct numerous NIH-funded
projects in which collaborative research teams design, implement, and evaluate theory-based preventive
interventions in natural service delivery settings and study the implementation science questions related to
successful program uptake. Training faculty have unique strengths in SU/A prevention, D&I, culture and health
disparities, and research methodology (particularly quantitative methods). The program is guided by an
External Training Faculty of national experts in implementation science and a Community Advisory Board
composed of decision leaders from service delivery settings (schools, courts, health care, and mental health
care settings), with whom we partner on community-based research projects. Training consists of mentored
research apprenticeships, an ongoing training seminar (including training in ethics and career development),
required courses in SU/A and D&I, and other relevant experiences based on Individualized Training Plans that
will be co-created with mentors. Through this tailored combination of coursework and research
apprenticeships, trainees acquire skills in designing interventions for implementation, models of cultural
adaptation, technology-based interventions, community-based participatory research, implementation theory
and design, organizational characteristics, and economic analysis. The research contributions of our trainees
will increase the adoption of evidence-based interventions in real world practice, helping to realize their public
health impact at the population level."

Despite the scale-up of free antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV incidence among men who have sex with men
(MSM) in Perú remains high. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal linkage to care are two important factors driving
onward transmission. New strategies to increase rates of testing and promote timely linkage to HIV treatment
and prevention are greatly needed. Venue-based testing and mobile health (mHealth) are two promising
strategies that could address these challenges by mitigating key barriers to care experienced by MSM in Perú.
Based on our previous work, offering HIV testing at social venues (e.g. bars/discos, public plazas) in Lima is
acceptable and identifies MSM with previously undiagnosed HIV infection. Extending this to sex-on-premises
venues (SOPVs: saunas, sex clubs, hourly hotels) could reach a particularly vulnerable sub-population of MSM,
including those not reached by clinic-based testing. One potential pitfall of venue-based HIV testing is low linkage
to care among newly diagnosed HIV+ individuals. WelTel is an evidence-based mHealth platform that may be
well-suited to assist by adapting its theory-guided two-way messaging approach to support linkage to care – and
prevention – among MSM reached for HIV testing at SOPVs. In this proposal we will develop, refine, and
conduct feasibility testing of a multi-component HIV testing and linkage-to-services intervention for MSM
in Perú, consisting of two core components: 1) SOPV-based HIV testing and 2) “AppSalud”, a novel tailored
application of WelTel to facilitate linkage to HIV services. In AIM 1, we will conduct formative research with the
target population and key stakeholders to guide development of the intervention. In AIM 2, we will develop
AppSalud by reconfiguring WelTel with new tailored content, then beta test it with both potential user types: (a)
MSM, and (b) providers at HIV clinics in Lima (to test the provider interface). Guided by the “mCFIR”, a mHealth-
specific version of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we will conduct a mixed
methods analysis exploring potential implementation barriers and facilitators for AppSalud from the perspectives
of both MSM and providers. In AIM 3, we will conduct a feasibility trial of the multi-component intervention (SOPV-
based HIV testing plus AppSalud), comparing 3 HIV testing formats: rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), home
based self-testing (HBST), and referral for clinic-based testing (RCBT). Supported by a team of experienced
international HIV investigators and outstanding institutions in both the U.S. and Perú, these studies constitute
the mentored clinical research component of the candidate’s career development plan. In parallel with this
research, the candidate will pursue additional training in implementation science, qualitative/mixed methods,
mHealth, and intervention trials, guided by a multidisciplinary team of committed mentors with expertise in
each of these areas. The training and mentored research made possible by this K23 Award will launch the
candidate’s career as an independent investigator poised to achieve his long-term goal of becoming a leading
HIV researcher developing evidence-based strategies to optimize HIV prevention and care globally."

My long-term career goal is to improve outcomes for pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in
part through development of improved modalities to detect residual disease and thus allow early identification
and intervention for those patients at highest risk of relapse. My clinical experience as a pediatric oncologist
specializing in treatment of myeloid malignancies informs my translational research focus in this area. This
mentored career development award will facilitate my development into an independent translational physician-
scientist by providing salary support and protected time to enhance my technical skills, knowledge base, and
personal development in digital PCR (dPCR) assay development and validation, duplex NGS technology, NGS
data analysis and bioinformatics, clinical trial design and development, networking, and collaboration. My
mentoring team comprised of Dr. Craig Jordan (primary mentor), Dr. Dan Pollyea, Dr. Mike Verneris, and Dr.
Chris Hourigan are all leaders in their respective fields and have a proven track record of fostering trainees and
junior faculty to successful academic careers. The resource-rich environment on the Anschutz Medical
Campus of the University of Colorado and the access to patient samples afforded me by the COG Myeloid
Committee further contribute to a high probability of success for the proposed patient-oriented research. AML
accounts for a disproportionate percentage of leukemia-associated morbidity and mortality in children, with
relapse the leading cause of death in these patients. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has been shown in
AML and other hematologic malignancies to be the single most valuable post-treatment predictor of relapse,
but the existing clinical assays for MRD have significant limitations such that a high proportion of children who
ultimately succumb to relapsed AML are actually MRD negative post-treatment. We hypothesize that
application of molecular MRD assays to pediatric AML disease monitoring will be a sensitive predictor of
disease burden and relapse. During the next 5 years I propose (1) to retrospectively evaluate the correlation
between relapse and MRD positivity by mutation-based and chimerism-based dPCR assays in pediatric AML
patients generally or post-transplant, respectively; (2) to retrospectively evaluate the correlation between
relapse and MRD positivity by custom duplex NGS panels in pediatric AML patients; and (3) to prospectively
validate the relapse predictive value of duplex NGS as a novel MRD modality in pediatric AML. Successful
completion of this project will pave the way toward development of molecular tools such as dPCR and duplex
NGS as improved MRD modalities that will enhance clinicians' ability to identify patients at highest risk of
relapse and intervene to prevent its occurrence. This will lead to improved survival in pediatric patients
suffering from myeloid leukemia."
10815738,"Each year, 20,000 children in the United States suffer a cardiac arrest, but only 17-50% survive. Survival
is associated with high-quality chest compressions. Yet, healthcare providers adhere to the rate and depth
guidelines recommended by the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) program for cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) an abysmal 20-40% of the time. Rates of high-quality chest compressions improve to 64%
with a quality CPR (qCPR) coach (a teammate giving real-time feedback on chest compression performance).
While effective, qCPR coaching is resource and personnel intensive, limiting its use in prehospital or community
settings where most children in cardiac arrest present for care.
 A novel strategy to provide real-time CPR feedback without additional personnel is the use of visual
feedback in a medical provider's field of view through augmented reality (AR). An AR feedback system called AR-
CPR has been shown to improve chest compression quality in real time, with promising usability and feasibility.
Data from 34 subjects, demonstrate the feasibility of a head mounted display to offer instantaneous visual CPR
feedback, and improved PALS adherence to chest compression rate and depth goals to 73%, from 17% without
feedback. While these data are promising, significant development and evidence gaps remain.
 Therefore, the R21 aims of this proposal are to refine AR-CPR for accurate and precise rate and depth
measurement (R21-Aim 1a), enhance usability (R21-Aim 1b), incorporate recoil feedback (R21-Aim 1c), and
validate the accuracy and precision of all measurements (R21-Aim 2). The R33 aims of this proposal are to
quantitatively evaluate AR-CPR in an international multicenter randomized simulation-based non-inferiority
study as compared to qCPR coaching (R33-Aim 1) and qualitatively evaluate usability and user experience
(R33Aim 2). It is hypothesized that these enhancements will improve the adherence to PALS guidelines and the
rate of high-quality CPR performance, positioning AR-CPR as the most effective pediatric CPR feedback system
available. The proposed research will take place as a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at The
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and
the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research, and Education (INSPIRE).
 In accordance with the mission of The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), this
proposal lays the groundwork to refine and improve AR-CPR by making this clinical lifesaving tool easier to
use, accessible, and affordable and thus equitably supporting providers at the point of care to perform higher
quality pediatric CPR in various clinical settings. This research will address two long term key goals: saving
children's lives and addressing inequities in care delivery by making high quality CPR widely available in lower
resource settings including in every hospital and ambulance, and with all automated external defibrillators in
schools, airports, malls, and households."
10833644,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rehabilitation of central visual disorders like amblyopia and cortical visual impairment depends on synaptic
plasticity, the changes in synaptic connections between neurons in the brain. A major regulator of synaptic plas-
ticity is brain state - the moment-to-moment fluctuations in attention, arousal, emotions and other factors sep-
arate from the actual content of experience - but brain states are generally left uncontrolled in treatment. Con-
trolling brain state may be particularly important for brain stimulation therapies like repetitive transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (rTMS), which mediate their effect through induction of neuroplasticity. The goal of this re-
search proposal is to explore how attentional state - an experimentally tractable, well-understood, and disease-
relevant brain state mechanism - regulates rTMS-induced neuroplasticity to the human visual cortex (Aim 1) and
frontal eye fields (FEF, Aim 2). Changes in the steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) contrast-response
function following rTMS provide a high signal-to-noise neural readout of visual cortical neuroplasticity, while
changes in psychophysical contrast discrimination sensitivity provides a perceptual readout of plasticity. During
rTMS, subjects will orient attention to either the same or opposite retinotopic visual field to which rTMS is tar-
geted, to determine how attentional state affects the propensity of rTMS to induce neuroplasticity. Powerful
quantitative linking models will then be used to link rTMS-induced neural changes to perceptual changes, and
to determine which neural changes most contribute to behavioral change (Aim 3). These experiments will pro-
vide novel evidence that attentional state controls the neuroplasticity effects of brain stimulation. Moreover, they
will help identify the cortical circuit mechanisms that are affected by rTMS and which of these mechanisms are
most determinative of behavioral change following rTMS. Together this provides fundamental knowledge in hu-
man visual cortical plasticity addressing NEI’s Area of Emphasis Biology and Neuroscience of Vision, and will
inform the development of brain state control paradigms to augment the efficacy of rehabilitative neuromodula-
tion therapies for visual disorders including hemineglect, cerebral scotoma, and amblyopia, in line with NEI’s
core programs on Strabismus/Amblyopia/Visual Processing and Low Vision/Blindness Rehabilitation. In the
process, the candidate will expand upon his background in in vivo synaptic plasticity and optical physiology in
autism animal models to gain expertise in core methods of human neuroscience including rTMS, MRI, EEG,
visual spatial attention paradigms, and computational modeling, learning from Stanford mentors who are au-
thorities in these techniques (Dr. Nolan Williams, Dr. Tony Norcia, and Dr. Justin Gardner). He will take full
advantage of Stanford’s vibrant intellectual environment, interacting with clinicians and researchers to bridge
the gap between basic neuroscience bench and the clinic bedside. This training will allow the candidate to estab-
lish a unique research niche at the interface of neuromodulation, neuroplasticity, and brain states and eventually
lead a translational program to implement neuromodulation-assisted behavioral and rehabilitation therapies."
10839368,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. While inflammation is a hallmark pathologic
feature of pneumonia, the use of corticosteroids to blunt the profound inflammatory response remains
undefined. Decades of studies in heterogeneous populations failed to show a consistent benefit, leading to
conflicting guidelines on the use of corticosteroids. Although corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in
COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of corticosteroids in other infectious pneumonia remains unclear with high
variability in clinical practice. This variability in practice presents an opportunity to see how corticosteroid
administration in pneumonia can be optimized and tailored to patient specific characteristics. The objective of
this study is to adapt advanced statistical and machine learning methods to already available robust
observational data from the electronic health record to identify predictors of clinical deterioration and to develop
an individualized treatment rule for steroid use in patients with community acquired pneumonia. This will be
accomplished through three specific aims: 1) To develop and validate a machine learning prediction tool for
in-hospital disease progression, 2) To develop and test an individualized treatment rule (ITR) for steroid use,
and 3) To conduct a single center feasibility clinical trial comparing ITR and biomarker guided corticosteroid
use and dosing to usual care in patients with community acquired pneumonia. We hypothesize that: 1) a
combination of demographics, physiological parameters, clinical and laboratory data will be accurate in
predicting risk of in-hospital disease progression and identifying steroid-responsive patients in whom benefit
from adjunct corticosteroid treatment outweighs potential harm, and 2) ITR and biomarker-guided
corticosteroid use, and dosing will be feasible. This career development award will provide important
preliminary data for future larger clinical trials focused on optimizing corticosteroid use in pneumonia while
training a junior investigator in the essential skills needed to become an independent researcher."
10862871,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation is a leading cause of human poisoning in the United States, resulting in about
50,000 cases and at least 1,500 deaths annually, as well as long-term cardiac and neurocognitive sequelae for
one-third of survivors. Unfortunately, no point of care antidotal therapy exists for CO poisoning to date. A field-
deployable agent that irreversibly scavenges and sequesters CO could serve as an improved therapeutic that
increases survival and long-term outcomes for patients suffering from CO poisoning. In this proposal, we will
exploit the uniquely strong and specific interaction between CO and ferrous heme by utilizing a hemoprotein
scaffold to develop a high-affinity CO scavenger. We recently discovered a remarkable hemoprotein domain,
found in the bacterial CO-sensing transcription factor RcoM (regulator of CO metabolism), that exhibits a 900-
fold increase in CO binding affinity compared to hemoglobin, the primary biological target in acute CO poisoning.
This RcoM hemoprotein also shows exquisite selectivity for CO over oxygen, a critical property for a CO antidote
that will be infused intravenously in humans under oxygenated conditions. In Aim 1, we will utilize in vitro
spectroscopic methods to identify 1) the minimum functional RcoM subunit, and 2) key amino acid residues that
confer high CO affinity, selectivity, and heme stability. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
three RcoM truncates with highest CO affinity and selectivity in vivo. We will assess systemic and organ-specific
effects of intravenous RcoM delivery in healthy mice and quantify the ability of infused RcoM to scavenge CO,
reverse hemodynamic collapse, and prevent death in a severe preclinical mouse model of CO poisoning. The
outcomes of these aims will provide fundamental insight into hemoprotein ligand selectivity and demonstrate the
therapeutic potential of recombinant RcoM as a treatment for acute CO poisoning. While toxic at high
concentrations, CO, endogenously produced as a by-product of heme degradation, serves as a cytoprotective
signal at low concentrations. Preclinical and clinical studies have explored the use of CO as a therapeutic under
conditions ranging from infection to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Despite potential clinical benefits, the roles of
CO as a signaling molecule are poorly understood, and the CO concentration regimes corresponding to basal
signaling, cytoprotection, and toxicity are poorly defined. A genetically encoded, CO-selective fluorescent
reporter would be the ideal tool to tease apart physiological roles of CO in living systems. In Aim 3, we will
employ the CO-sensing function of RcoM to design a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, characterize CO-
dependent response in vitro, and incorporate this reporter into the mouse genome using CRISPR/Cas9. We will
quantify CO accumulation in transgenic reporter mice under different CO exposure conditions and define regimes
that give rise to CO signaling, cytoprotection, and toxicity in vivo. Through this aim, we will develop critical
biomolecular tools that will enable elucidation of CO-dependent signaling mechanisms relevant to human health."
10835969,"ABSTRACT
 Premature birth is the leading cause of neonatal intensive care unit admissions and exerts a high burden of
disease and health care cost, approaching $13.4 billion annually in the United States. Advances in neonatal
medicine such as antenatal steroids and surfactant have improved survival, particularly in infants born extremely
premature (before 30 weeks’ gestational age). Consequently, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is increasing
in prevalence. This often results in lifelong cardiopulmonary sequelae that overlap with chronic diseases such
as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension, increasing the risk of premature
death. Unfortunately, the impact of extreme prematurity or postnatal steroid treatment on cardiopulmonary
structure and function has not been rigorously evaluated during early school age (6-8 years), when early
identification could prevent long-term adverse outcomes. Thus, significant changes can occur and remain
undetected during this critical age of rapid lung growth and alveolarization, a time during which intervention could
be the most advantageous. To address this unmet need, we will capitalize on two outstanding resources already
in place at Cincinnati Children’s: 1) cutting-edge proton and hyperpolarized-gas magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) that can precisely characterize phenotypes of BPD in the Cincinnati BPD Center and 2) a well-
characterized population-based cohort of preterm infants from the NIH-funded Cincinnati Infant
Neurodevelopment Early Prediction Study (CINEPS) that will reach school age during this funding period. We
will recruit the CINEPS subgroup of extremely preterm infants (140 with BPD; 68 without BPD) and a new cohort
of 50 term-born controls and study them longitudinally at 6 and 8 years of age with proton and hyperpolarized
gas MRI, spirometry, plethysmography, diffusion capacity, and a parent questionnaire. The primary goal of this
proposal is to define changes in cardiopulmonary structure and function in extremely preterm infants
during early school age. We will further evaluate the effects of postnatal steroids therapy on lung structure
and function compared to untreated infants matched using propensity score weighting. This novel proposal
represents the first application of hyperpolarized gas MRI in a cohort of extremely preterm children. Further, this
proposal represents the most detailed evaluation of the trajectory of extreme prematurity on cardiopulmonary
structure and function through early school age. This high-impact research will define the progression of lung,
heart, and pulmonary vascular disease as well as response to postnatal therapies and provide a unique
opportunity for early identification of patients who will develop chronic changes related to extremely preterm birth
and BPD."
10815733,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sinai Chicago (Sinai) is Illinois’ largest private safety-net healthcare system, serving
predominantly low-income communities of color with large Medicaid-eligible populations
in Chicago. In response to high diabetes rates and community calls for coordinated,
multidisciplinary diabetes care, Sinai designed the Center for Diabetes and
Endocrinology (the Center) which launched in 2020. The Center uses a comprehensive
model with streamlined services to address the full spectrum of patient medical and
non-medical needs. We propose a convergent mixed-methods optimization study to
determine the appropriateness and fidelity of three intervention components of a team-
based care model for patients served by the Center to define the ideal sequence for
improving patient outcomes. Grounded in qualitative methodology and guided by a
sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), we propose evaluating the
appropriateness of novel intervention enhancements (Aim 1); measuring fidelity of new
intervention enhancements (Aim 2); comparing the effectiveness and determining
optimization of intervention enhancements (Aim 3). We will evaluate Aim 1 via key
stakeholder interviews and focus groups. We will analyze Aims 2 and 3 by conducting
descriptive statistics on all variables, giving special attention to outlier values. We will
also run bivariate and multivariate analyses across variables of interest and time points
to determine the optimal sequence of intervention activities. We will disseminate our
learnings broadly to key stakeholders through community forums, peer-reviewed
publications and presentations. Our multi-disciplinary team has a wealth of experience
in health services programming as well as research and evaluation. We propose a 3
year, $1.5 million project from March 2023 to February 2026."
10818615,"Project Summary
Transposable elements are major sources of heritable human genetic variation and can contribute to disease by
causing somatic mutations. This application focuses on the development of genomic tools and technologies to
assess the contributions of these transposons to somatic mosaicism in normal tissues. Specifically, we will
develop tools and technologies to detect variants in long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) sequences. L1 is
the only active self-propagating protein-coding transposon in humans. We each inherit a distinct complement of
active L1 loci, each of which is typically repressed through methylation of its internal promoter. Here, we propose
to develop single cell mapping approaches to detect de novo L1 insertions and integrate these with long-read
sequencing approaches to reveal the epigenetic status of source elements. We will also pioneer highly innovative
approaches to detect intermediates of the target primed reverse transcription (TPRT) reaction that gives rise to
L1 insertion events. Our multidisciplinary team brings together investigators with expertise in retrotransposon
biology and genetic variation; innovation in the field of epigenetics; and experience with molecular biology and
computational genomics methods development. Our shared goal in this UG3/UH3 project is to provide enabling
tools and technologies to the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) Network."
10898774,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Cancer is a complex disease in which multiple genetic, genomic, epigenetic, environmental, and other
factors combine to influence one’s risk—and ultimately to mediate cancer development and progression. While
cancer researchers recognize this complexity, most analytical methods in use have been built around relatively
simple approximations that fail to capture the multifactorial nature of cancer. During the past few years, my
colleagues and I have worked to develop new methodological approaches to analyze the nature of complex
diseases such as cancer. At the heart of these methods is the postulate that what defines each phenotype is a
characteristic network, that differences in networks between phenotypes can provide insight into biological
mechanisms, and that the structure and properties of these networks can shed light on the factors that drive
disease risk, development, and progression. While many methods have been developed to model networks,
we believe that what distinguishes our methods is that they use our understanding of biological processes,
such as transcription, to seed the model in a principled way and that, by design, their goal is translational,
bridging the gap between mathematics and medicine to support our understanding of cancer. This R35 project
would allow me to build on my successes, expanding my work in systems biology approaches by integrating
multi-omic and multi-factorial cancer data into our models with an emphasis on providing insight into both the
underlying biology of cancer and new ways to treat and manage the disease."
10896398,"A fundamental question in organ formation is how the constituent tissues achieve their correct sizes and
cytoarchitectures. Defects in a single tissue can affect the formation of an entire organ and a classic
example of this is the eye, where disruptions in retinal histogenesis can cause microphthalmia, a severe
ocular anomaly characterized by small, poorly formed eyes and congenital blindness. Mutations in the
Visual System Homeobox 2 (Vsx2) gene cause microphthalmia. A definitive marker of retinal
specification, Vsx2 functions in retinal progenitor cells to define tissue identity. Concurrently, Vsx2 is
required for progenitor proliferation and several aspects of the neurogenic program including the timing
of neurogenesis onset (neurogenic timing), and the fate specification of bipolar cells. Two gaps in our
understanding are the mechanistic interconnectedness of the progenitor properties regulated by Vsx2
and whether progenitors change in how they utilize Vsx2 over the course of histogenesis. To address
these gaps, we generated two new Vsx2 alleles in mice, one with a knock-in reporter/knock-out
configuration and the other for conditional gene inactivation. In the first two aims, we will characterize the
retinal phenotypes of these mutant alleles and determine how they compare to phenotypes caused by a
natural null allele and two missense alleles that correspond to disease-causing mutations in humans.
Conditional gene inactivation will be done with tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox recombination to determine
the temporal windows of Vsx2 utilization in progenitors and test the hypothesis that Vsx2’s control of
retinal identity, neurogenic timing, and proliferation are separable. We also predict that additional roles in
the balanced production of cells in each retinal cell class (neurogenic output) will be unmasked by
temporal inactivation after the start of neurogenesis. In the third aim, we test the hypothesis that retinal
identity control shifts from a Vsx2-dependent to independent state that is epigenetically defined for some
of the earlier targets. In the fourth aim, we will incorporate an ex vivo culture paradigm to test candidate
genes identified in the previous aims for their functional significance in promoting or interfering with
retinal development. Completion of these studies will provide new insights into how Vsx2 orchestrates
retinal progenitor properties and how retinal progenitors drive retinal histogenesis, an essential
component of eye organogenesis."
10893024,"This is a competitive renewal application to continue our work deciphering the molecular and cellular facets
of host immunity in high-risk corneal grafts, performed in inflamed host beds and distinguished by their
rapid rejection. Over the past 4 funded cycles, this project has led to over 100 scientific articles spanning
important areas of transplant immunity, including characterization of corneal antigen-presenting cell (APC)
populations and the mechanisms of their trafficking, regulation of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis,
mechanisms of T cell activation and homing, and the function of regulatory T cells (Treg) in promoting
immune quiescence and allotolerance. In the last 4 years, we have made significant progress, showing how
the microenvironment of a graft can regulate Treg phenotype: in the physiologic state, which is largely
maintained in the low-risk graft setting, Foxp3hi Treg express an array of membrane-associated inhibitory
factors (CTLA-4, PD-L1) and secreted anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFβ) that promote immune
tolerance and graft cytoprotection. This homeostasis is lost in the high-risk setting, leading to Treg
dysfunction and potential generation of a subset of Treg (`ex-Treg') that express pro-inflammatory cytokines
that cause tissue damage. In the current proposal, we aim to better understand the cross-regulation of APC
and Treg in different graft settings. Our overarching hypothesis is that the high-risk graft is characterized
by an ocular microenvironment that abrogates the capacity of Treg to suppress graft site APC maturation
(Aim 1), while these mature APC will in turn promote Treg dysfunction in the draining lymph node, the
critical site of host T cell sensitization and expansion (Aim 2). We then aim to exploit functional host Treg by
administering them locally to high-risk host beds to assess their anti-angiogenic functions (Aim 3). Our aims
are novel, addressing important gaps in our knowledge: Aim 1, investigating the differential capacity of
Treg derived from the ocular surface of HR vs. LR graft recipients in regulating APC maturation is the first
study in the field of transplantation evaluating regulation of APCs by Tregs at the graft site. Aim 2 will
address a major gap in our knowledge about how APC secretory function can influence Treg phenotype and
function. Aim 3 includes the first studies characterizing the mechanisms by which Treg exert anti-angiogenic
function in transplantation, a novel and potentially feasible therapeutic strategy in the HR transplant setting.
Our study design relies on the core expertise and extensive experience of our lab studying the
immunology of corneal transplantation. The overall health relevance of this research is that corneal
grafting is the number one form of transplantation performed in the US. While most high-risk transplants get
rejected, there has been no significant change in their management for 60+ years. The long-term objective
of our project is to develop new strategies to promote graft acceptance without the use of systemic
immunosuppressive regimens that place grafted recipients at significant risk of serious morbidities."
10766813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The central nervous system (CNS) is an important target organ for nearly every major human fungal
pathogen including Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma and others. In almost all
examples, the fungus either colonizes or infects one organ system and then disseminates to the CNS. The
most common initial site of infection is the lung as exemplified by the pathogenesis of Cryptococcus,
Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Aspergillus while Candida albicans is unique in that it is a commensal of the
human GI tract that infects in the brain during invasive disease. Premature infants have long been recognized
as the patient cohort most at-risk for C. albicans CNS disease, although recently it has been recognized that
adults with mutations in the CARD9 innate immune pathway are also at high risk. Importantly, C. albicans
meningoencephalitis contributes to the fact that, among infants who survive sepsis, those infected with C.
albicans have much poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes than infants infected with bacteria. Thus, CNS
disease is a clinically important sequelae of candidiasis. However, we know very little about the mechanisms
that underlie the ability of C. albicans to infect the CNS. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose to
utilize a new model of C. albicans CNS infection to screen collections of transcription factor (TF) and protein
kinase (PK) mutants to identify key regulators of C. albicans neurotropism. We discovered that mice lacking
the IL-1 receptor (IL1-R) develop dramatically increased brain burden during disseminated candidiasis relative
to congenic WT mice. The increased CNS fungal burden in il1r-/- mice provides sufficiently robust dynamic
range to allow the identification of C. albicans mutants with decreased CNS infectivity whereas standard WT
mouse strains are only transiently infected by C. albicans at relatively low fungal burden. We, therefore,
propose to use this novel model to perform a genetic screen to identify TFs and PKs that are required for C.
albicans CNS infectivity (Aim 1). We will generate competitive fitness profiles of barcoded pools of TF mutants
isolated from mouse brain tissue after both intravenous (IV) and intracranial (IC) inoculation routes. In Aim 2,
we will characterize the effects of a focused set of TF and PK mutants by: 1) analyzing their interactions with
on brain endothelial cells; 2) determining their effect on the transcription of virulence and environmentally
responsive genes in vivo during CNS infection; and 3) determining their genetic interaction profiles with the
other TFs and PKs. These experiments will provide the first characterization of the genetic and transcriptional
requirements for C. albicans CNS infection and will set the stage for future, detailed mechanistic studies of C.
albicans neurotropism."

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI, Hurler syndrome) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease in

immunogenic enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A GàA mutation

genotype-phenotype correlation—all homozygous W402X patients exhibit severe disease. Project 3 will focus
on an AAV-based adenine base editing postnatal treatment of MPSI, with the aim to file an IND application

10880563,"Project Summary
The embryonic ventral telencephalon, the subpallium, is the developmental origin of numerous brain structures
and cell populations such as the basal ganglia and cortical interneurons. These structures and cell populations
are critical for higher brain functions and are often causally involved in neuropsychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia, autism, and drug addiction. Thus, a better understanding of ventral telencephalon development
will not only improve our understanding of brain development and brain function but also advance treatments
of nervous system disorders. All neurons and glia generated in the ventral telencephalon are descendants of
subpallial neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which here broadly include multipotent stem/progenitor cells known
as apical progenitors (APs) and lineage-restricted transit-amplifying cells known as basal or intermediate
progenitors (BPs). Because research on NPCs during mammalian brain development has focused on the
cortex, comparatively little is known about the steps of the developmental progression of subpallial NPCs and
the mechanisms involved, although it is evident that subpallial NPCs must possess unique features that
underlie their distinct cellular outputs (in terms of cell number and cell type). The objective of this application is
to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control the developmental progression of subpallial
NPCs. Recently, by analyzing a conditional knockout mouse line lacking Tead1 and Tead2, which encode key
transcription factors of the Hippo pathway—a signaling pathway crucial for the development, tumorigenesis,
and regeneration of most tissues across species, we found that the TEAD transcription factors are novel
regulators of the developmental progression of subpallial NPCs; they uniquely regulate subpallial, but not
pallial (cortical), NPCs and act through Hippo pathway-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that TEAD regulates the developmental progression of subpallial NPCs with a
dual mode of action: in APs, TEAD interacts with YAP/TAZ to maintain the AP state; in BPs, however, TEAD
interacts with INSM1 to repress the AP state and promote developmental progression. Specifically, the
proposed study will: (1) dissect the role of TEAD in subpallium development by using various genetic modified
mouse models, (2) determine whether TEAD acts through INSM1 in subpallial basal progenitors, and (3) define
the transcriptional mechanism through which TEAD regulates subpallial NPCs. The proposed study is
expected to expand our knowledge of the mechanisms that uniquely regulate the developmental progression of
subpallial NPCs and improve our understanding of an important signaling pathway—the Hippo pathway."
10877749,"Title: Enhancing the efficacy of androgen signaling inhibitors in prostate cancer
Abstract
It has been documented that androgen receptor (AR) signaling remains to play a critical role in castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Indeed, Androgen Signaling Inhibitors (ASI), such as abiraterone, an
inhibitor of de novo androgen synthesis pathway, and enzalutamide, a direct AR inhibitor, are major drugs
used in clinic to manage CRPC now. Unfortunately, ASI-based treatment only improves the overall
patient survival by several months. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASI
resistance and development of novel avenues to increase the efficacy of ASI-based therapy are urgently
needed. With the goal to identify new pathways/targets whose inhibition might overcome ASI resistance,
we performed extensive bioinformatics analyses of RNA-seq data including those from paired prostate
cancer (PCa) cells with different sensitivities to enzalutamide, 498 PCa tumors with different responses
to hormone therapy and 52 pairs of PCa specimen (tumors vs adjacent normal). Both the -catenin-
dependent canonical Wnt cascade and the -catenin-independent non-canonical Wnt signaling were
identified as pathways whose elevation might contribute to acquisition of ASI resistance. The objective
of the proposed research is to define the roles of Wnt signaling in acquisition of ASI resistance in CRPC
and to exploit these pathways as novel therapeutic targets for CRPC patients who no longer respond to
ASIs. The central hypothesis is that Wnt signaling causes constitutive activation of AR signaling, thus
CRPC progression and development of ASI resistance. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three
Specific Aims - (1) to dissect the role of-catenin signaling in enzalutamide resistance of PCa; (2) to
examine how activation of the non-canonical Wnt signaling contributes to enzalutamide resistance in
PCa; and (3) to test whether simultaneous inhibition of canonical and non-canonical Wnt cascades is an
effective approach to treat enzalutamide-resistant PCa and to probe the significance of tumor
microenvironment Wnt in the acquisition of enzalutamide resistance. These complementary aims will be
accomplished using biochemical analyses of signaling intermediates and employing gain-of-function and
loss-of-function strategies with inducible PCa mouse models, culture systems, human PCa xenograft,
and patient-derived organoid methodologies. The rationale for the research is that it will be the first to
comprenhensively probe the importance of Wnt signaling in acquisition of ASI resistance of CRPC. This
contribution is significant because it will (i) define the molecular mechanism by which Wnt signaling
activates AR; (ii) genetically evaluate how these pathways contribute to PCa progression and metastasis;
and (iii) demonstrate Wnt cascades as critical therapeutic targets to enhance the efficacy of ASI."
10880554,"Breaking neuronal symmetry is a fundamental process in the formation of a polarized neuron. Neurons in the
developing cerebral cortex are born as spherical cells that must extend leading and trailing processes to migrate
to their destination in the developing cortical plate. Cortical neurons then extend long axons and dendrites from
these processes to create functional circuits. Cortical neuron migration and process extension is critically
dependent on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, but relatively little is known about how the actin cytoskeleton
and plasma membrane are coordinated during these events. Membrane protrusion and invagination are
fundamental cellular activities that require coordination of the plasma membrane and underlying actin cytoskeleton.
However, there is a dearth of data on how membrane protrusion and invagination are integrated in process
outgrowth and neuronal migration. The F-BAR superfamily of proteins are involved in membrane curvature sensing
and deformation through their F-BAR domain, positioning them as potentially important players in both membrane
invagination and protrusion. Structurally, they form a curved dimer that self-multimerizes around endocytic
vesicles, causing their elongation into tubules. The CIP4 family of proteins (CIP4, FBP17 and TOCA1) is a group
of F-BAR proteins that bind actin-associated proteins. Like other F-BAR proteins, the CIP4 family is thought to
function primarily in membrane invagination and endocytosis, but our recent work has implicated CIP4 in neuronal
membrane protrusion as well. Lamellipodial-like protrusions induced by CIP4 strongly inhibit neurite outgrowth in
culture. Conversely, we find that a close family member, FBP17, forms endocytic tubules in developing cortical
neurons and promotes prominent filopodia formation, resulting in precocious neurite outgrowth. In this proposal we
will test the novel hypothesis that protrusion through CIP4 and invagination through FBP17 act in opposing
manners to regulate cortical neuron migration and process formation in the developing cortex. Specifically, we will:
1) Determine how CIP4 induces membrane protrusions and FBP17 forms endocytic tubules, 2) Establish how
membrane tubulation results in precocious filopodia formation and neurite outgrowth, 3) Reveal the spatial and
temporal expression pattern of endogenously-labeled CIP4 and FBP17 in mouse lines and 4) Resolve CIP4 and
FBP17 function in cortical development in vivo. This work will provide fundamental insights into how proteins that
bridge the membrane and actin cytoskeleton function to regulate process outgrowth and cortical neuron migration
in the early developing mammalian brain. CIP4 and FBP17 have been implicated in Huntington's disease and
several forms of cancer, underscoring the importance of determining the function of these proteins in the developing
cerebral cortex."

The objective of the Human Clinical Phenotyping (HCP) Core is to promote excellence in human phenotyping,

readily available to IDDRC investigators through this centralized database. The HCP also provides IDDRC 
members access to state-of-the-art human neuroimaging resources (Aim 4) and engages in the development 
of next-generation phenotyping tools (Aim 5). The HCP actively disseminates research findings and 
information about ongoing research projects to the local community, and information about HCP Core 
resources and opportunities for collaboration to the Einstein/Montefiore researchers and clinicians (Aim 6). 
Since its inauguration 10-years ago, the HCP has become an integral part of human IDD work at 
Einstein/Montefiore. For example, it is essential to Einstein’s role in an ‘Autism Centers of Excellence Network’ 
project on the genetics of autism in individuals of African descent (MH100027), and it has been vital to a 
number of clinical-research partnerships including a basic neuroscience-HCP collaboration that led to the 
identification of a novel IDD syndrome (ANKS1B haploinsufficiency syndrome). Under the P50 the HCP will 
continue to support these interwoven aims to promote the mission of the RFK IDDRC to advance diagnosis, 
prevention, and treatment of children with IDDs. In addition, it will serve the proposed IDDRC signature 
Research Project by generating a research database of individuals affected by KDM5C mutations (Aim 7). 
Through these aims the HCP will maintain its role as the central hub for a variety of Center investigators for 
whom comprehensive human phenotyping is key to understanding the implications of their work."
10886057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – NEUROGENOMICS CORE 
Neurogenomics research, including analysis of DNA, RNA and the epigenome, consisting of investigation of 
chromatin and methylation, is increasingly important in studies of intellectual and developmental disabilities 
(IDDs). For example, neurogenomics analysis can identify the cause of human IDDs as well as determine the 
mechanism by which genes are regulated in animal or cell-based models. The Neurogenomics (NGEN) Core 
provides standard and innovative genomic assays that range from genotyping of DNA variants in human 
subjects through single cell RNA-sequencing or evaluation of accessible chromatin in neural progenitor cells. 
The NCEI with the NGEN Core will establish spatial transcriptomic technology, making it possible to investigate 
gene expression in the context of tissue architecture. Further, the NGEN Core provides computational and 
bioinformatic analysis of large datasets that emerge from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments and 
will train students and postdoctoral fellows. The NGEN core is flexible to relinquish old services that are no 
longer utilized or cost effective, to implement innovative services that will enhance IDD research and discovery. 
The team consists of a Director and Associate Director with complementary expertise in human genetics, 
functional genomics and epigenomics. The Operations Directors have hands-on roles in implementing and 
establishing new technologies or bioinformatic services that are performed by senior technical staff. The 
NGEN Core has an advisory committee needed to ensure optimal service and to help decide which services to 
offer in the Core. The NGEN Core Components are part of established shared facilities at Einstein that also 
has oversite from the Cancer Center and College. One of the challenges in performing genomics research is 
how to choose among many different assays that are available. The NGEN Core provides guidance to IDDRC 
investigators in a prioritized manner, from study design, to experimental optimization to bioinformatic analysis. 
For this, the Directors meet with individual investigators to provide guidance in helping to choose assays that 
are best suited for their particular research question. Members of the IDDRC will receive prioritized access to 
NGEN Core services and personalized consultation. The IDDRC Pilot Award and Voucher program is also 
available through the ADM Core on a competitive basis, making it possible for investigators to initiate 
neurogenomics projects even if current grant funding is limited. Through this facilitated availability of a wide 
range of services and innovative technologies involving critical aspects of genomic analysis, the NGEN core is 
an essential component of the IDDRC."
10886062,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – (Core D: NCEI Core) 
The Neural Cell Engineering and Imaging Core (Core D, NCEI) has been a vital component of the Kennedy 
Center for 30 years, steadily growing in resources and user base, with 70 individuals from 50 IDDRC 
laboratories utilizing the Core in the last 3 years alone. The NCEI Core consists of 3 major divisions: The Cell 
and Tissue Engineering Subcore, with facilities and expertise for cell/tissue culture work including primary, 
embryonic, iPS cells and modern neural differentiation protocols. The Modern Microscopy Subcore, with 
instruments for tissue sectioning and imaging. And the Analysis and Graphics Subcore, which provides 
workstations with sophisticated software for deconvolution, quantitative 2D to 5D image analyses and 
reconstruction, custom software and macros, as well as graphics and printing services. To optimize use of 
these tools for IDDRC investigators and their trainees, NCEI leadership provides in-depth user consultation, 
emphasizes well-planned experimental design, and engages in vigilant monitoring of project progress. The 
Core’s value is extended linkage with expert advisors allowing studies on gene targeting, gene therapy, RNA 
constructs, optogenetics, electrophysiology, and human ES, iPS and fetal cells, including organoids. 
Productivity and innovation are also enhanced by interaction with other IDDRC Cores, coordinating, e.g., 
studies correlating brain cell and anatomic changes with behavioral phenotypes (AP), genetic or epigenetic 
evaluations on isolated cell subpopulations/single cells (NGEN), and translational studies on reprogrammed 
cells and iPSC-derived organoids from patients (HCP). Core resources also serve the P50 research project on 
KDM5C disease by providing imaging and quantitative analyses of changes in gene expression, analysis of 
neural subtypes and dendritic changes in mouse models, and generating iPS cells/organoids and 
differentiating neurons from patient samples carrying KDM5C mutations. The Core maintains high standards of 
quality control through scheduled internal evaluations and the annual user survey carried out by the ADM 
Core. Collectively, the NCEI Core represents a significant part of the scientific bridge between genetics and 
cognitive phenotypes and as such has a broad and significant impact on the research carried out by IDDRC 
investigators and their trainees focused on, and critical to, understanding and treating IDDs."
10886066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – ANIMAL PHENOTYPING 
Phenotyping animal models of disease is a critical element in our Center’s goal to understand, effectively treat, 
and when possible, prevent intellectual and developmental disabilities in children. Accordingly, the mission of 
the Animal Phenotyping Core (Core E, AP) is to assist investigators seeking to discover behavioral, 
physiological, structural and metabolic phenotypes in diverse rodent models of intellectual and developmental 
disabilities. The AP Core performs studies primarily in mice and rats to identify the functional alterations 
resulting from genetic, developmental or environmental manipulations that may impair neural and behavioral 
development. These include changes in developmental milestones, sensorimotor function, cognitive function, 
affective and social behaviors, feeding and activity patterns, body composition and/or energy expenditure, 
patterns of brain activity and anatomy as assessed by brain imaging in MRI/DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) and 
PET scans. The AP Core accomplishes its goals through SubCores focused on (1) behavior, (2) metabolism, 
and (3) brain imaging. By combining existing capabilities and highly experienced faculty we have established 
an animal phenotyping facility uniquely suited to plan, perform and evaluate coordinated behavioral, metabolic, 
and functional neuroimaging assessments in developing and adult rodents. Through close collaborative efforts 
with the Neural Cell Engineering and Imaging (NCEI) Core and the Human Clinical Phenotyping (HCP) Core, 
as well as the Neurogenomics (NGEN) Core, the consequences of defined genetic, environmental and/or 
physiological alterations are thoroughly characterized to determine their impact in the context of measures 
most relevant and translatable to the human disease phenotype. The AP Core also makes critical contributions 
to Aim 2 of the RFK IDDRC signature research project focused on links between mutations in KDM5C and 
IDD. In addition to the wide range of expertise of its leadership and the resources they bring to this effort, the 
AP Core also emphasizes the importance of integration across measurement and analytical capabilities, i.e., it 
facilitates a combination of methodological approaches such as pursuit of brain imaging simultaneously with 
behavioral studies. We also emphasize, when possible, phenotyping techniques that are most comparable to 
those used in children with IDD. In pursuit of these scientific objectives, the AP Core leadership, in concert 
with ADM Core oversight, also carefully monitors IDDRC investigator Core access and user satisfaction, cost 
effectiveness and quality control."
10886072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RESEARCH PROJECT 
Mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator lysine demethylase 5C (KDM5C) are found in 
patients with intellectual disability (ID). While the direct link between loss of function mutations in KDM5C and 
ID is clear, how KDM5C functions to mediate critical neuronal processes, and therefore the consequence of 
mutations for mechanisms of IDD, remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to understand the 
relationship between KDM5C-regulated gene expression programs and the occurrence of ID and additional 
comorbid features that are observed in patients. We will achieve this by bringing together a multi-disciplinary 
research team with expertise in complementary analytical tools and model systems to test two hypotheses. 
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the use of human iPSC-derived in vitro cell models of KDM5C-induced ID will 
result in the identification of clinically relevant gene expression changes and neuronal functional deficits. One 
key model system we will use is iPSC-derived cerebral organoids, which recapitulate structural and molecular 
aspects of fetal brain development and are a critical research tool used to define the underlying cause(s) of 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Indeed, molecular and cellular studies using in vitro organoid systems allow us 
to carry out studies in a human cell context that would simply not be possible in vivo. iPSCs and organoids will 
be generated from two sources: (1) Cells from patients with KDM5C-induced ID from a newly recruited cohort 
of individuals from which we are generating a genotype-phenotype database; (2) CRISPR-Cas9-mediated 
gene editing to generate a KDM5C null allele and a published ID allele (KDM5CA388P) that lacks histone 
demethylase activity using existing iPSC lines generated from typically developing controls. We will use this 
system to combine morphological, functional and multi-OMICS approaches to define the impact of patient- 
associated mutations in KDM5C. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the regulation of translation efficiency in 
neurons by the fly homolog of KDM5C is conserved in mammalian systems and that this function is important 
for cognition. Here we take advantage of fly and mouse animal model systems, both as discovery tools and to 
test hypotheses regarding possible contributors to the cognitive effects of mutations in KDM5C. Because other 
inherited forms of ID have altered translation and correcting this deficit has shown promise in mouse models of 
other ID disorders, we will test whether altered translation similarly plays a key role in a mouse model of 
KDM5C-induced ID. 
 This work is significant because we will define the etiological links between mutations in human KDM5C 
and ID. The proposed studies are technologically innovative in the use of complementary model systems and 
state-of-the-art genomics techniques such as single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). It is also conceptually 
innovative in proposing a role for translation in KDM5C-induced ID."
10876410,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)
The Administrative Core (AC) oversees all functions of the University of Iowa Hawkeye Intellectual and
Developmental Disability Research Center (Hawk-IDDRC) to ensure an optimal environment for conducting
IDD research across the lifespan, tailored to a rural population, that will improve the diagnosis, prevention,
treatment and amelioration of IDDs. The AC is led by IDDRC co-directors Lane Strathearn and Ted Abel who
have the experience, commitment, and vision to lead a collaborative center that integrates basic and clinical
science. The AC will oversee the research project and cores, including 11 federally funded projects totaling
$6.1 million per year, promote collaboration within the Hawk-IDDRC and among other IDDRCs, and support
outreach and education missions. The AC will focus on four areas: (1) Administrative Oversight. To provide
the leadership and administrative oversight to manage a productive, cost-effective Center focused on IDD
research, the AC will: coordinate Center activities and advisory committees; manage the Hawk-IDDRC budget;
liaise with the NICHD Steering Committee including regular meetings and progress reports; ensure that
institutional resources are available for cores; work closely with the UI Center for Advancement to fundraise;
and conduct an annual center evaluation. (2) Research Support. To support an innovative Research Project
and state-of-the-art core research facilities that promote collaborative, multidisciplinary, and translational
research programs, the AC will: support new and existing research projects that are relevant to IDD, prioritizing
translational research projects, and multi-disciplinary teams; integrate the work of multiple cores with research
projects, using the Hawk-IDDRC Research Project as an exemplar; assess research core services by
reviewing user satisfaction surveys; oversee the recruitment of top IDD investigators; administer Hawk-IDDRC-
sponsored awards; and set up new research services at the request of users. (3) Research Dissemination
and Communication. To ensure effective communication to other scientists, educators, policy makers,
government entities, and the lay public, including diverse populations and those with IDD conditions and their
families, the AC will disseminate research information through: the University Center for Excellence in
Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD); the Hawk-IDDRC website and social media platforms; a monthly INI
seminar series; Iowa’s Center for Disabilities and Development (CDD) Centerlines quarterly newsletter;
biannual public workshops; and scientific and lay publications. (4) Education. To support the next generation
of IDD clinicians, physician-scientists, and researchers, the AC will: provide IDD-specific educational input for
LEND, T32, KL2 and K12 awardees; organize monthly IDDRC seminars and yearly retreats; support mentoring
programs; and sponsor an educational program directed toward the lay public and IDD community. Overall, the
Administrative Core will support 29 federally funded projects ($13.8 million per year)."
10876416,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE (CTC)
The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) of the Hawk-IDDRC seeks to address the challenges faced by those
living with IDD at all life stages by providing investigators the resources to transition discoveries from the
laboratory into clinical practice, and enable an understanding of the biology underlying clinical observations, in
order to advance translational research. The CTC differentiates itself by providing infrastructure for recruiting
rural populations as well as participants at key transition points across the lifespan, including: the perinatal
period, puberty and adolescence, adulthood at varying levels of independence, and later adulthood as
professional caregivers assume a primary role. These transition points represent critical periods that influence
the long-term wellbeing of those living with IDD, yet our understanding of each is limited. Importantly, rural
populations 1) have decreased access to appropriate care, 2) have different potential IDD exposures that are
not well studied, and 3) lack research infrastructure. The Hawk-IDDRC CTC is poised to fill these needs and
will thus provide access to unique clinical data and biosamples from this understudied population by carrying
out the following aims: 1) Facilitate and accelerate the recruitment and clinical evaluation of IDD-affected
patients at all stages of life and from diverse areas to connect them and their families with clinical studies and
resources; 2) Provide IDD researchers with biobanking and bioinformatics services; 3) Facilitate and support
the design, development, and testing of novel IDD therapies by providing a successful architecture for clinical
trials and drug manufacturing services to IDD researchers. The expertise and resources of the CTC Co-
Directors (Mark Santillan and Alexander Bassuk) covers a broad spectrum of capabilities, ranging from
prenatal risk assessment, to human subject recruitment, and banking of clinical data and biosamples. Specific
assets of the University of Iowa (UI) that cover the lifespan include CoLab (Global Pregnancy Collaboration),
an international collaboration of 40 sites focused on pregnancy outcome research, sharing clinical data and
biosamples; a clinical recruitment center for SPARK, a nationwide genetic study of autism; UI-led statewide
networks of collaborating clinics, schools, and providers in rural and urban areas; and the Intellectual Disability-
Mental Illness (ID-MI) clinic, one of only a handful of inpatient units in the country that focuses on patients with
intellectual disability and a co-occurring mental illness. The CTC will serve as a central focal point for these
resources, streamlining access for investigators, and enabling its support of 31 federally funded projects
totaling $12.6 million per year. The access to a unified, harmonized source of clinical data, biosamples, and
clinical cohorts allows the CTC to work with all Cores to perform retrospective and prospective IDD studies.
The resources of the CTC will support the mission of the Hawk-IDDRC to provide an organizational structure
that integrates basic and clinical research across the lifespan—from conception to adulthood—focused on the
prevention, diagnosis, treatment and amelioration of IDDs, and tailored to a rural, underserved population."
10876422,"PROJECT SUMMARY: DEVELOPMENTAL GENOMICS/EPIGENETICS CORE (DGC)
The primary objective of the Developmental Genomics/Epigenetics core (DGC) is to support innovative and
cutting-edge genome-scale research of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) across the lifespan—
from conception to adulthood, tailored to a rural population. Under the leadership of co-directors Dr. Richard
Smith and Dr. Jake Michaelson, who together have substantial, NIH-backed experience in experimental
(Smith) and computational (Michaelson) genomics, the DGC will provide broad expertise that encompasses
model system development, high-throughput sequencing technologies (e.g., genome and exome sequencing,
RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, methylation sequencing, and ribosome
sequencing), and bioinformatics and computational analysis of the results. Each of these foundational services
is housed within its own organizational unit: 1) the Genomics Division provides high-throughput sequencing
and array services including exome and genome sequencing, RNA-sequencing (including 10X Chromium
single-cell sequencing), and array-based genotyping and methylation services under the direction of Dr.
Richard Smith, an accomplished genomics investigator; and 2) the Bioinformatics Division provides services
for quality control, basic processing (e.g., alignment, variant calling, and expression quantification), and
pipelines for calculating polygenic risk scores from data produced by array or sequencing services generated
by the genomics division, and is led by Dr. Jake Michaelson, an experienced computational genomics
investigator. The DGC will utilize existing resources within the Iowa Institute for Human Genetics (led by co-
director Dr. Richard Smith), which has a strong track record in education and dissemination, with regularly
occurring workshops, tutorials, videos, and online certification opportunities. Since its inception, the DGC has
been calibrated to the overall theme of the Hawk-IDDRC: IDD research across the lifespan. In particular,
epigenetic signatures specific to development and aging are accessible through the Core's epigenetic array-
and sequencing-based assays. The DGC also interrogates intrinsic and extrinsic sources of risk by offering
genomic (intrinsic) and epigenetic (extrinsic) assay options. Finally, a focus on rural populations is achieved
through the extensive experience of both Drs. Smith and Michaelson in collecting samples from sparsely
populated areas, both in person and through mail recruitment campaigns (e.g., using saliva collection kits or
Guthrie cards). Services from the DGC will complement and synergize with those of the other Cores in the
Center, such as with the Clinical Translational Core in recruitment efforts to obtain biosamples, and will
support 17 federally funded projects ($4.8 million per year). Collectively, the available expertise and cutting-
edge services provided by the DGC will catalyze IDD research by minimizing barriers for entry into genome-
scale studies of neurodevelopment and cognitive function."
10876425,"PROJECT SUMMARY: NEUROCIRCUITRY AND BEHAVIOR CORE (NBC) 
The primary objective of the Neurocircuitry and Behavior Core (NBC) is to provide state-of-the-art services that 
foster studies of intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) across the lifespan—from conception to 
adulthood, tailored to a rural population. The Core will support research projects affiliated with the Hawk- 
IDDRC that utilize both animals and humans as well as those that cross-fertilize a translational approach to the 
study of IDD from a lifespan perspective. The Core is made up of two units: 1) Neuroimaging Division (NID) 
and 2) Neural Circuits and Behavior Division (NCBD). The NID will assist in the development, 
implementation, and completion of neuroimaging research studies in animal models as well as humans. 
Neuroimaging modalities will focus on imaging techniques to assess brain structure, function, and metabolism. 
The resources provided will include expertise in the following aspects of brain imaging: a) development of 
novel imaging tools, pulse sequences, and equipment; b) implementation of protocols for image acquisition; c) 
implementation and deployment of standard image analysis pipelines; d) development of novel image analysis 
strategies; and e) data management, bioinformatics, and statistical support for imaging data. The NCBD will 
provide expertise in neural circuit function, behavior (e.g. social interaction, sleep), and cognition (e.g. learning 
and memory) in animal models and humans using tools that are often not available within individual 
laboratories. For studies using animal models, the NCBD will provide facilities and services to aid investigators 
performing behavioral assays. For human studies, the NCBD has significant expertise in studying human 
behavior and cognition across the lifespan and will design and implement cognitive paradigms to study neural 
circuits, which can be applied to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as controls. 
Finally, the NID and NCBD are able to conduct experiments as requested by investigators, or will provide the 
necessary training to enable laboratory personnel to perform experiments in the facility. 
The NBC will integrate and capitalize upon strong existing resources currently available at the University of 
Iowa including the Iowa Institute for Biomedical Imaging (IIBI) and the Iowa Neuroscience Institute (INI). Tools 
that are developed as part of the NBC will be shared with IDD investigators across the country. The NBC will 
support 27 federally funded projects ($11.3 million per year) and will build upon strong existing collaborations 
between basic scientists who use animal models and clinical scientists engaged in human brain studies. In 
addition, the NBC will help strengthen the relationship between scientists and the IDD community and their 
families, many of whom live in rural areas, helping foster collaborations that will enable a better understanding 
of IDD from a lifespan perspective."
10876427,"ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT
Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) affect up to one in six children in the United States, with
proposed etiologies ranging from genetic to multi-factorial. For a vast majority of children, no clear genetic or
environmental etiology is identified, although evidence suggests that genetic (intrinsic) risk may interact with
the early learning and social environment (extrinsic risk) to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in later
stages of life. For example, the neuropeptide oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) are epigenetically altered by
early social experience, play crucial roles in mammalian social and cognitive development, and are associated
with both genetic and epigenetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of this Hawk-IDDRC
Research Project is to examine epigenetic, polygenic and environmental risk factors for IDD, focusing on ASD
as a prototype. We will use an innovative new smartphone application, BabySteps, to enroll and collect data on
300 mothers and their children between 2 and 3 years of age, over a 6-month period. One hundred and sixty
ASD children will be enrolled, along with 80 children with non-ASD developmental delay (DD), and 80 typically
developing (TD) control children, matched by race/ethnicity, sex and family socioeconomic status. We will
examine changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) in 27 specific ASD-associated loci, as well as 3 OXTR loci, as a
function of age and social experience, in children with and without autism, comparing DNAm from stored
newborn dried blood spots to samples collected at the time of diagnosis. Polygenic risk scores for ASD will be
calculated using Illumina PsychArray, and the relative polygenic and epigenetic risk assessed using resources
from the Developmental Genomics/Epigenetics Core. The relationship between DNAm and social
experience will be assessed using 2 complementary measures: 1) the Language Experience Analysis (LENA)
based on audio recordings from a LENA device worn by the child over a 4-day period at home and in daycare;
and 2) ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of parental social and emotional availability collected using
the BabySteps app. Children will be recruited through the Clinical Translational Core and Autism Center after
ASD is either confirmed or excluded, based on ADOS testing and/or rigorous clinical assessment. A subset of
20 ASD and 20 TD children will participate in pilot resting state functional connectivity scanning through the
Neurocircuitry and Behavior Core, to examine associations between DNAm of ASD-associated loci,
including OXTR, and differences in brain connectivity. With the Administrative Core, we will share the
BabySteps app with other Centers in the IDDRC Network and prospectively compare the effects of perinatal
stress and social/learning experience on DNAm in children yet to be diagnosed with ASD. It is hypothesized
that both polygenic factors and early social experience (via epigenetic modifications) contribute to ASD or IDD
risk. Understanding how the environment interacts with genetic vulnerability will provide an unprecedented
opportunity to re-assess early intervention and prevention strategies."
10851965,"Abstract
This revised renewal application investigates novel mechanisms driving dysregulation of post-
transcriptional control in cancer. Indeed, dysregulation of these events can drive the production
of proteins that underpin proliferation, survival, invasion and metastases. Dysregulation can
occur at many levels of RNA processing including splicing of RNAs, their nuclear export and
translation. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, dysregulated in ~30% of cancers
including in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), governs the RNA processing of networks of
transcripts that ultimately underpin its oncogenic activities. Its ability to govern these regulons
has been attributed to its well-established roles in nuclear export and translation of specific
RNAs. Here, we discovered that eIF4E reprograms the splicing landscape of 1000s of
transcripts both as a function of eIF4E dysregulation in AML patients as well as upon eIF4E
overexpression in model systems. We compared alternative splicing (AS) events in high-eIF4E
AML and upon eIF4E overexpression in cells, postulating those in common would represent
pan-cancer targets of eIF4E-dependent splicing. We discovered a set of ~150 AS “core”
transcripts, which encoded factors in the same biochemical networks. Importantly, these
pathways also play roles in AML and in cancer more generally. Many of the AS events are
predicted to produce proteins with different domain structures and thus altered functionalities.
As to the mechanisms by which eIF4E modulates AS, our studies unearthed physical
interactions between eIF4E and components of the spliceosome as well as revealed novel
means to control the production of the splicing machinery i.e. via eIF4E. Three aims are
proposed to dissect the mechanistic principles and biological impacts related to these novel
findings: Aim 1. Explore eIF4E-dependent alterations to splicing where we will dissect the
biochemical activities of eIF4E required for its AS activity, and assess the functional outcome of
this activity; Aim 2. Elucidate the biochemical role that eIF4E plays in re-programming splicing
by dissecting the physical interactions of eIF4E with components of the spliceosome and
ascertain its relationship with active spliceosomes; and Aim 3. Determine the impact of
dysregulated eIF4E-dependent splicing in AML where we will explore the impact of AS, and
identify the splicing factors required for eIF4E’s activity. These studies will transform our view
with regard to the impact of eIF4E dysregulation, which would now include altering the form of
the transcript as well as regulating its protein-coding capacity."
10809657,"ABSTRACT
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong, neurodevelopmental disorder with significant
consequences for individuals and their families. Over 95% of individuals with ASD have at least one comorbid
psychiatric, neurologic, or physical health condition. Many also struggle with other developmental challenges
such as intellectual disabilities and/or complex communication needs and often receive inadequate care.
These unmet needs, which often begin in childhood, can have negative impacts on the health and well-being of
those with ASD through their lives. The incidence rates of adverse outcomes have steadily increased for youth
with ASD over the last decade. While consistent management of mental health and other comorbid conditions
might reduce episodes of emergencies, the heterogeneity of ASD and health disparities resulting from
race/ethnicity, gender, and/or socioeconomic status (SES) potentially impede the effectiveness of evidence-
based treatments for ASD in the “real world”. In addition, the increasing practice of excessive polypharmacy of
psychotropic medication is likely to have negative impact on utilization and effectiveness of non-
pharmacological treatments, though little is known about its specific effect on uptake as well as, intensity and
duration of behavioral therapies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress on individuals with mental
health illnesses, and, subsequently, incidence of psychiatric crises. Understanding treatment utilization
patterns and variations across demographic, geographic and socioeconomic factors will provide guidance to
improve the efficiency of health care delivery and quality of health services for individuals with ASD.
 Leveraging large, national, longitudinally constructed Medicaid claims databases (2008-2022), we will
examine the interplay between polypharmacy of psychotropic medications and key ASD behavioral therapies
among youth aged 5-26 with ASD and evaluate their impact on preventing behavioral health crises. In
particular, we will (1) examine the trends and multi-level factors associated with utilization and quality of
behavioral health and pharmacological treatments among youth with ASD; (2) examine the trends and health
disparities in the rates of psychiatric adverse events among youth with ASD; (3) examine the impact of quality
of behavioral health treatments and their interplay with polypharmacy on psychiatric adverse events among
youth with ASD. The proposed study will provide a comprehensive assessment of the quality of ASD-related
treatments and services in a real-world setting and shed light on disparities in service use, quality of care, and
health outcomes, particularly in regards to the risk of behavioral health crises among youth with ASD. This
information will be valuable to families exploring treatment options, as well as to providers in determining
treatment options to maximize benefit. Identifying barriers to accessing services and implementation of
evidence-based practice will help guide policies at the payer, state, and national levels."

Project Summary
Programmed cell death (PCD) operates during innate immunity to eliminate virus-infected cells and regulate
infection-associated inflammation during virus invasion. Little information is available regarding the precise
contributions of PCD toward the pathogenesis of retinal diseases of virus origin, especially those caused by
herpesviruses including AIDS-related human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis. A critical barrier to progress
in advancing our ability to diagnose, prevent, and/or treat herpesvirus retinal diseases has been a lack of
information on the possible contributions of different forms of PCD toward onset and development of these
virus-induced retinal diseases including AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. Our goal is to address this knowledge
deficit and the critical barrier to progress by obtaining new information needed to define the relative individual
and collective roles of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis during onset and development of this sight-
threatening eye disease using an established mouse model of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) retinitis in
mice with retrovirus-induced immunosuppression (MAIDS). Our central hypothesis is that apoptosis,
necroptosis, and pyroptosis conspire via different mechanisms to contribute to the severe retinal tissue
destruction during MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis pathogenesis. Our objectives are to use the MAIDS model
of MCMV retinitis to (1) obtain the information needed to understand the precise contributions and begin to
understand the mechanisms by which these PCD pathways contribute to retinal tissue destruction and loss of
function, (2) explore the mechanisms by which these PCD pathways stimulate inflammation within retinal
tissues during retinal disease onset and development, and (3) establish that PCD inhibitors represent a new
therapeutic approach for management of cytomegalovirus retinal disease. These objectives will be met through
successful completion of three Specific Aims: (1) test the hypothesis that multiple PCD pathways contribute to
retinal tissue destruction during MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis pathogenesis, (2) test the hypothesis that PCD-
initiated inflammation plays a critical role in development of retinal tissue destruction during MAIDS-related
MCMV retinitis pathogenesis, and (3) test the hypothesis that PCD inhibitors will alter the onset and
progression of MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis.

The theme guides a career development program in which early career faculty acquire capabilities in scholarly 
communication, scientific leadership, and the translation of research findings to effective interventions, with a 
new emphasis on Hispanic aging. 
The aims will be achieved by integrating the REC scholars with teams conducting research relevant to the 
OAIC goal of identifying pathways of physical function and developing interventions that will improve functional 
recovery and enhance independence in diverse older adults. The teams are multidisciplinary and led by 
experienced mentors with demonstrated research expertise and documented external funding. The REC 
leadership includes senior faculty with both research and administrative experience related to career 
development, e.g., directors of training programs, T32s, K12s. In addition, the REC includes clinician-scientists 
as members of each research team to ensure that the mentoring experiences are high quality and include 
appropriate translational opportunities related to diversity, aging and geriatric research."
10908357,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PESC) 
The UTMB Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) drives the innovation of the UTMB OAIC by supporting 
the development and maturation of new research programs relevant to our core mission of understanding 
and improving physical function and independence in older adults. The PESC prioritizes support of early 
stage investigators, while seeking to build and extend collaborations by attracting established investigators 
from other disciplines. Over the previous cycles we have supported a high proportion of early stage (71%), 
women (37%) and minority (34%) investigators. 72% of the pilot studies completed during the past two 
cycles have led to extramural funding. 
The PESC funds pilot projects, and small exploratory projects that align with our broader OAIC theme: 
“Translate Pathways of Function Loss and Gain into Interventions to Optimize Functional Recovery in 
Diverse Geriatric Populations”. By leveraging institutional resources and OAIC-network collaborations we 
seek to accomplish the following specific aims: 
 1. Stimulate new research foci relevant to the OAIC theme. 
 2. Oversee and monitor the funded projects. 
 3. Support the development of new research programs. 
We will accomplish our aims by soliciting, reviewing and selecting meritorious pilot proposals relevant to the 
OAIC theme; identifying opportunities for collaboration and co-sponsorship of our studies; providing early 
mentoring support and access to resources from other OAIC cores and institutional facilities; monitoring 
progress of the funded studies; ensuring regulatory compliance, safety and protection of human subjects; 
tracking success and productivity of the funded projects; and providing individual mentoring and resources 
to transition completed PESC studies into competitive, external grant applications. 
In the next cycle we will expand our breadth by developing new multicenter collaborations with other NIA 
centers (RCMAR) and other OAICs (Wake Forest), with an emphasis on scaling up trials in hospitalized 
geriatric patients, neurologic diseases and Hispanic Aging."
10897932,"PROJECT 4 – SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is driven by a complex, multifactorial etiology that has stymied progress toward
effective therapies. Despite decades of research on amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, we do not fully understand the
cellular and molecular effects of these key disease drivers. These pathologic proteins interact with genetic
drivers, such as apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), creating complex and diverse cellular and brain-regional effects.
One promising approach to understanding the diverse effectors of AD pathogenesis is to study central processes
that are perturbed by each disease driver. Both AD pathology and APOE genotype exacerbate neural network
dysfunction in brain regions critical for cognition, nominating neural network function as one such critical central
process. Besides causing AD-related cognitive decline, neural network dysfunction results in comorbidities such
as subclinical epileptiform activity. The lack of a comprehensive picture of the cellular, molecular, and genetic
underpinnings of AD underscores the need for detailed and rigorous dissection of the many factors that contribute
to this disease. The goal of this PPG is to identify the cellular and molecular consequences of the interactions
between Aβ, tau, and APOE and determine how they lead to prolonged neural network dysfunction.
 Genetic and pathologic alterations drive AD by affecting cellular state. For example, neuronal and glial cells
interact with and are affected by Aβ and tau pathology, leading to changes in gene expression that are further
altered by the genetic milieu of the cell, culminating in an altered cellular state. Understanding how cellular state
changes and is controlled by multifactorial inputs of AD could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. However,
these cellular responses are cell type– and cell context–specific. Techniques for single-cell transcriptomic and
epigenomic profiling now make it possible to characterize the specific cellular response to combinatorial
interactions between Aβ, tau, and APOE. To systematically understand cellular responses to Aβ, tau, and APOE
in human AD, Project 4 will comprehensively characterize cell-type-specific transcriptomics and epigenomics in
primary human samples.
 In Aim 1, we will perform single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling in human cohorts that
have been rigorously characterized, both clinically and pathologically, and that vary in APOE genotype, Aβ and
tau pathology, and cognitive state. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data with snRNA-seq results from novel
humanized mouse lines designed to dissect the combinatorial effects of Aβ, tau, and APOE (with Projects 1–3).
In Aim 3, we will use single-cell technologies to understand the effects of therapeutic reversal of prolonged neural
network dysfunction in mouse models (with Projects 2 and 3). The results of the proposed studies, in concert
with the other complementary projects, will provide an unparalleled characterization of the multifactorial etiology
of neural network dysfunction in AD, and may suggest novel avenues for therapeutic intervention."
10799694,"Summary: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer that is treated with
neoadjuvant therapy that targets both the primary tumor and systemic disease, with subsequent adjuvant
immunotherapy. Even with the most cutting-edge therapeutic approach, approximately 20% of these patients,
despite a pathologic complete response (pCR), have residual disease, present locally or in distal tissues, which
may lead to disease recurrence either locally or within distal tissues. We have devised a novel technology – a
scaffold that serves as a synthetic metastatic niche (MN) – that captures the systemic effects (i.e., immunological
changes, tumor cells) of residual disease and could be employed to monitor for disease burden, progression, or
regression. The pores of the scaffold allow for host cell infiltration and vascular ingrowth, with immune cells
attracted to the implant based on a foreign body response. In a tumor-bearing mouse, the immune cells recruited
to the implant are distinct from tumor-free mice, reflecting the changes observed in endogenous tissues (i.e.,
lung) because of systemic changes following cancer initiation and progression. These infiltrating immune cells
precede the arrival of tumor cells, prepare the site for colonization, and facilitate disease progression. We
propose that the scaffold can be used for longitudinal monitoring of disease following neoadjuvant and adjuvant
immunotherapy. Disease monitoring is based on the molecular and cellular composition within the scaffold (e.g.,
immune cells or tumor cells) that reflect the systemic impacts of residual disease. The aims of the proposal
include: Aim 1 will develop a prognostic signature that can determine response to neoadjuvant therapy and
reflect the presence of residual disease. The scaffold will supplement the histological analysis of the primary site
and can indicate the presence of residual disease through the systemic effects on cellular and molecular
phenotypes in the scaffold. The scaffold analyses will be compared with histology of patient tissue, with the goal
of identifying situations in which a pCR does not capture residual disease. In Aim 2, we propose to investigate
the use of scaffolds for surveillance of recurrence and monitoring response during adjuvant therapy. We will also
analyze the scaffold for the mechanisms that underlie the development of resistance to immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB). Identification of residual disease typically occurs when patients self-report symptoms, indicating
late-stage disease recurrence. Our platform overcomes this critical barrier by pre-defining a location to analyze
for the systemic effects of disease. Collectively, these scaffolds provide a defined site in vivo to analyze that
captures the systemic effects of residual disease on distant tissues. A solid organ, such as lung, cannot be
readily monitored over time in a patient due to the morbidity of the procedure and early metastatic foci are small
and difficult to detect within the total organ. Collectively, the scaffolds provide a tool to monitor for residual
disease following neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy that is accessible with minimal risk, with the cellular and
molecular analyses guiding individualized treatments with the potential to improve survival and reduce costs."
10843321,"Abstract
Bone marrow perfusion can provide essential knowledge about bone physiology, improve our understanding of
disease etiology and pathophysiology, assist the differentiation between normal and abnormal bone marrow,
and assess the response to prescribed therapies. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), as a noninvasive and non-contrast-enhanced approach, is well suited for longitudinal monitoring of
disease progression and routine evaluation of therapy response. But as revealed by our recent studies, there
exist technical challenges (e.g., low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio due to significantly low perfusion in epiphyseal
yellow bone marrow mainly consisting of fat cells with a sparse network of capillaries), and methodological
limitations (e.g., single slice coverage and impractically long acquisition time for multi-slice imaging at 3T),
hampering routine application of ASL imaging in the knee. Ultrahigh (≥7T) magnetic field can specifically benefit
ASL imaging and overcome these challenges by increasing SNR, prolonging blood and tissue T1, and improving
parallel imaging performance. However, the current clinically approved single-transmit MRI system and
associated imaging methods are incapable of managing the transmit B1 (B1+) fields needed to realize the
promised improvement in imaging quality, reliability, and robustness of 7T while existing RF coils are unable to
provide adequate B1+ coverage for optimal ASL imaging. Our long-term goal is to develop and improve UHF
imaging methods to better facilitate scientific research and clinical studies to improve the management of skeletal
diseases and patient healthcare. The rationale is that the existing technical challenges for UHF imaging,
including ASL, can be overcome or mitigated, ultimately to realize UHF potentials with promised benefits and
superior imaging ability. The objective of this proposal is to develop an optimized, safe, and efficient pTx platform
for knee ASL imaging (Aim 1), to develop and optimize pTx-integrated knee ASL imaging methods (Aim 2) and
to explore their clinical potentials via studies with a cohort of JOCD patients, an ideal testbed for the developed
methodologies. Accomplishing these aims will enable us to fully explore and utilize pTx potentials to overcome
the existing technical challenges for knee ASL imaging at 7T. Once developed and optimized, the ASL methods,
along with the pTx knee imaging platform, will provide clinicians and research community a powerful tool to
enrich our insights into disease etiology and pathophysiology and improve the management of not only JOCD
but also various impactful common knee diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis). Novel knowledge and experience from
our pioneering development will speed up the maturity of new technology toward early approval of the next
generation of clinical UHF MRI systems."

 Environmental factors including diet and gut microbiota profoundly impact the host resistance and
susceptibility towards intestinal inflammation. A high intake of ultra-processed foods enriched with refined starch,
sugar, protein, and hydrogenated fat and low in whole grain contents increases the risk of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Despite such robust epidemiological data that ultra-processed food is associated with a higher
risk of IBD, the underlying mechanisms by which ultra-processed foods escalate IBD susceptibility remains
sparse. This proposal aims to elucidate such mechanisms with a goal to devise a dietary-based intervention(s)
to reduce IBD onset and occurrence.
 Interferon gamma (IFNγ)-inducible immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) family M, named IRGM in humans
and Irgm1 in mice, is a disease susceptibility risk allele for Crohn’s disease in humans. Irgm1 orchestrates
autophagy-mediated immunity against bacteria and impedes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our preliminary
observation demonstrated that ultra-processed ingredient diet (PID) reduced colonic expression of IFN-γ
inducible genes, which protect against invading microbes. PID-fed mice also exhibited increased encroachment
of colonic bacteria into the mucus layer and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, these mice developed
severe experimental acute (induced by dextran sulfate sodium, DSS) and chronic (induced by IL-10 receptor
neutralization) colitis. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that heightened microbial encroachment
due to impaired host resistance against microbes and persistent activation of NLRP3 inflammasome escalates
susceptibility to IBD in PID-fed mice. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
Aim 1
: Assess the role of IFNγ-inducible GTPases in escalating PID-induced predisposition to IBD.
Aim 2
: Assess the role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in the regulation of IFNγ-inducible GTPases and
PID-induced IBD susceptibility.
Aim 3
: Assess the role of NLR inflammasomes and IFNγ-inducible GTPase axis in PID-induced IBD
susceptibility.
 This proposal has potential implications for public health, given that the prevalence of IBD has risen in
parallel with the increase in the intake of ultra-processed foods. Completion of the aims of this proposal will
identify the mechanism(s) by which a processed diet increases the risk of IBD. A mechanistic understanding of
how ultra-processed diet increases susceptibility to IBD will lead the way toward defining a dietary strategy to
reduce the incidence of IBD in humans.

Visual perception is mediated by complex interactions amongst neurons in the retina, visual cortex, and
subcortical brain structures. The importance of vision to humans and other primates is reflected in the
enormous percentage of cerebral cortex devoted to processing visual information. Thus, deficits in visual
processing are particularly debilitating and arise from abnormalities not only in the eye, but also in cortical and
subcortical circuitry. For example, strabismus or amblyopia during childhood can have long-lasting effects on
the cortical circuits that process visual information. There is also evidence that some forms of dyslexia result
from central visual system abnormalities. The function of the nervous system is dependent on complex
interactions between networks of neurons composed of multiple neuron types across multiple cortical and
subcortical areas. General principles about cortical feedback connections and corticothalamic networks
learned from studies of the mouse visual system are likely to also apply to circuits mediating cognitive
functions and may be impaired in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. The proposed studies are
aimed at revealing the organization and functional impact of: 1) cortical feedback connections to the primary
visual cortex; and 2) cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. These studies are conducted in mice to take advantage
of the range of molecular, genetic, and viral tools that can be used to elucidate brain circuits and link them to
function using optogenetic and imaging methods. The 4 aims will reveal: 1) the functional impact of feedback
from layers 2/3 or layer 5 of cortical areas AL and PM to V1; 2) how feedback from layers 2/3 or layer 5 of
cortical areas AL and PM to V1 integrate with specific inhibitory circuits within V1; 3) the input-output
relationships of neurons in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus that project to identified visual cortical areas; 4)
the functional impact of pulvinar inputs to the visual cortex."

Integration of genomic sequencing into everyday medical practice has already begun. In our first funding period,
Precision Medicine Policy and Treatment Model (PreEMPT) I, we began exploring the benefits and risks
associated with genomic sequencing in newborns, which has compelling logic: It can provide clinically actionable
insights to prevent illness altogether or to facilitate early detection of illnesses in childhood or adulthood.
Notwithstanding the clinical utility of newborn genomic sequencing and cascade testing of family members,
questions remain: cost-effectiveness of newborn genomic sequencing, long-term effects on disease morbidity
and mortality, and diagnostic and treatment-related costs. These knowledge gaps are important to fill, given
expectations about widespread applications of genomic sequencing.
Our proposed research will create PreEMPT II by extending our existing computer microsimulation model
developed in PreEMPT I to reflect the impact of newborn genomic sequencing on a wider array of childhood-
onset diseases and their long-term consequences into adulthood. Additionally, we will refine our approach to
considering the impact of targeted screening of siblings of children with pathogenic variants. Previously, we
developed a framework to evaluate newborn genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer and cardiac diseases. In
this renewal, we will extend this framework to evaluate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness for metabolic
diseases such as Pompe disease and biotinidase deficiency, and other diseases such as malignant
hyperthermia. To highlight critical knowledge gaps, we will use value of information analysis to identify high-
priority research studies within the rapidly evolving area of genomic medicine with a focus on addressing race-
based health disparities. We will enhance our existing simulation model to synthesize the best available clinical,
epidemiologic and economic data, and use our analytic framework to project both short- and long-term outcomes
associated with alternative screening strategies and assess the potential value of genomic sequencing in
reducing racial disparities in disease outcomes.
Our interdisciplinary team includes experts in simulation modeling, health economics, genomics, pediatrics,
predictive modeling, health policy, and health systems research. We propose a highly innovative application of
modeling methods to genomic technologies with the goal of synthesizing available clinical and epidemiological
data into a unified modeling effort. The goal is to project long-term outcomes by incorporating evolving data in
the area of genomic sequencing for newborns, permitting ready evaluation and guidance for clinical care in the
United States over the next decades."
10909196,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent chronic neurologic disease diagnosed during early adulthood that often
leads to cognitive and sensorimotor decline. Inflammatory demyelinating lesions are key neuropathological
features of MS, but neurodegeneration leading to gray matter loss is prominent, begins early, and is the main
driver of functional decline. Lack of neuroregenerative therapies or functionally restorative treatments highlights
a need to identify modifiable risk and protective factors that preserve gray matter and function. This R01
renewal of the Reserve against Disability in Early MS (RADIEMS) cohort extends our prior work on “reserve”
against disability to establish a much-needed framework for investigating functional decline in MS. We propose
a dynamic model of reserve in which candidate modifiable risk and protective factors contribute to functional
outcomes through (a) maintenance of gray matter (Aim 1), or (b) by modulating one’s ability to maintain
function despite loss of gray matter (compensation; Aim 2). RADIEMS enrolled 185 MS patients diagnosed
≤5.0 years (median=2.0) receiving high resolution MRIs and comprehensive cognitive and sensorimotor
evaluations at baseline (Y0) and Y3; this renewal adds Y6 and Y8 follow-ups. Retention is excellent (95.0%).
Aim 1a investigates whether MIND diet consumption (e.g., leafy greens, fish, nuts, berries) and body mass
index (BMI) independently predict maintenance of (a) cerebral gray matter and (b) cognitive and sensorimotor
functional outcomes over Y0-Y3-Y6-Y8. We will also evaluate percent body fat measured via bioelectrical
impedance as a key culprit in obesity-related morbidity. Aim 1b assesses whether links between MIND diet and
BMI with functional outcomes are mediated through gray matter change. Aim 1c analyzes blood and stool
samples banked at Y3 for metabolomics & microbiome sequencing to identify nutrient and gut microbiotic
mediators of dietary effects on outcomes. Aim 2a: preliminary data link depressed mood to poor cognitive and
gait speed / endurance, which fluctuate with mood changes over time. We will assess whether cognitive and
sensorimotor functions fluctuate with mood across Y0-Y3-Y6-Y8, and if mood moderates links between gray
matter loss and outcomes. We will also investigate independent contributions of positively-valanced aspects of
psychological function. Aim 2b assessed whether memory fluctuates with subjective (Y0-Y3-Y6-Y8) and
objective (Y6-Y8) sleep disturbance. Little is known about sleep quality and functional outcomes in MS. A large
subsample of patients will undergo actigraphy and ambulatory polysomnography at Y6 & Y8; we expect sleep
efficiency (especially sleep fragmentation) to explain memory. RADIEMS is a large deeply-phenotyped cohort
study of functional outcomes in early MS: a unique and valuable resource for the field. This R01 renewal
extends our work on reserve to establish a critical framework for investigating functional decline. This dynamic
model will be tested and updated over time to understand mechanistic mediators of risk and protective factors
to inform the development of interventions to preserve gray matter and improve functional outcomes."
10863994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The discrimination of highly similar episodes is termed behavioral pattern separation. This episodic memory
process is altered by stress and decreased in humans with and rodent models for a range of brain disorders,
including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Behavioral pattern separation is also susceptible to “load”; it
is harder to discriminate episodes that are very similar (high load) vs. different (low load). Defining the
underlying circuitry in memory stages and load-sensitivity is a key step to a future where poor behavioral
pattern separation might be treated via circuit-based manipulations.
The focus of this application is the role of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in behavioral pattern separation.
The anatomical connections of the LEC suggest it is central to this stress-sensitive process. The LEC is
innervated by polymodal-, emotion, and stress-linked brain regions. The LEC innervates downstream
hippocampal regions critical for behavioral pattern separation, including the dentate gyrus (DG). In fact LEC
layer IIa stellate fan cells (LECIIa fan cells) send glutamate directly to two key DG cells, DG granule cells and
adult-generated neurons, which are both critical for “high load” pattern separation and are very sensitive to
stress. Excellent human imaging and rodent lesion and neural recording studies also suggest the LEC has a
role in behavioral pattern separation. However, the LEC’s causal role in orchestrating behavioral pattern
separation and its memory stages is untested. The lack of data on LEC’s role is striking given that the LEC is
vulnerable to stress, aging, and disease. A link between LEC and the poor pattern separation seen in age and
disease — including in stress-induced cognitive disorders like PTSD — remains correlative. Direct evidence of
the LEC’s role in behavioral pattern separation is paramount to clear understanding of cortical-hippocampal
circuitry and its function in nonpathological and pathological states.
In this revised R01 application, we propose three aims to provide fundamental understanding of how LECIIa
fan cells are involved in behavioral pattern separation, during what memory stage and which memory load, and
how the LEC-DG circuit activity could be manipulated to overcome stress-induced disruption of pattern
separation. Aim 1. Test if the encoding and consolidation of behavioral pattern separation rely on the activity of
LECIIa fan cell terminals in the DG. Aim 2. Test if behavioral pattern separation performance/retrieval is
modulated by the activity of the LEC fan cell-DG circuit. Aim 3. Test if repeated stress disrupts behavioral
pattern separation performance/retrieval in a way that can be reversed by LEC-DG circuit stimulation.
The data from these Aims will fill major knowledge gaps in the existing models of the neural circuitry that
supports behavioral pattern separation. They will provide essential behavioral and mechanistic insight to
understand poor pattern separation and to fuel therapeutics to combat stress-induced cognitive dysfunction."

The primary purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F30 application is to provide the groundwork that will
prepare the applicant for an academic medical career. Much of the applicant’s career development will come
from work in High Priority HIV/AIDS comorbidity-related research, and she will have the invaluable opportunity
to carry out high quality research using a well-established preclinical model of chronic binge alcohol (CBA) and
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. At-risk alcohol use is twice as likely in people living with HIV
(PLWH) as it is in the general population. PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) have a near normal life
expectancy, but there is an increase in prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, requiring a need for research
studying pathophysiological mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in the context of HIV. Studies from our group
have shown that at-risk alcohol use and CBA is associated with impaired insulin/glucose dynamics in PLWH and
in SIV-infected macaques, respectively. Skeletal muscle (SKM) is a major site of insulin-dependent glucose
uptake, and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol decreases SKM insulin sensitivity. Preliminary data
generated for this application suggest that CBA dysregulates proteins in the insulin signaling pathway in SKM,
further indicating that alcohol leads to SKM dysfunction. With previous work from our group demonstrating that
CBA-mediated alterations in myotubes reflect what is seen in SKM, we will utilize cultured myotubes to reflect
changes seen in SKM in our proposed experiments. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate cellular changes in
pathologic and therapeutic conditions by transporting bioactive cargo, including microRNAs (miRNAs), between
cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are differentially expressed by
CBA and insulin resistance. Preliminary and previous data suggests that CBA leads to lower expression of the
SKM specific miRNA-206 in plasma EVs and the SKM of SIV-infected macaques, and miRNA-206 is implicated
in SKM insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Taken together, our preliminary data and published literature support
the hypothesis, that alcohol-mediated alterations in myotube extracellular vesicle miRNA cargo contribute
to decreased myotube insulin sensitivity in SIV infection. The proposed study will employ a wide variety of
state-of- the-art techniques to test the hypothesis using two specific aims: (1) CBA-administration alters myotube-
derived EV profile in SIV-infected macaques, and (2) myotube-derived EV miRNA cargo of CBA-administered
SIV-infected macaques decreases myotube insulin sensitivity. Findings from the proposed studies will provide
insight on the role of EVs in alcohol-mediated SKM insulin insensitivity in SIV infection. Additionally, the proposed
project aims to illustrate the therapeutic potential of EVs in improving alcohol-mediated SKM dysfunction. With
a strong mentoring team committed to developing a well-rounded physician scientist, completion of the proposed
training plan in High Priority HIV/AIDS comorbidity-related research will ensure that the applicant is ready to
embark on a career in academic medicine."

Prior studies have identified several risk factors related to cardiometabolic diseases. However, the rates of risk
factor elevation are highly variable among patients. For example, despite obesity being identified as a primary
risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases, a subgroup of obese patients does not develop downstream
cardiometabolic complications. This suggests that there are other mediating mechanisms, independent of
known risk factors, underlying cardiometabolic diseases. This project will leverage multi-omics data in
conjunction with clustering approaches capitalizing on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in BioVU,
GWAS and other omics data generated by the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program
and metabolomics data collected at 3 time points in a prospective cohort of bariatric surgery to identify: 1)
clusters of individuals that represent cardiometabolic diseases (defined as novel/endotypic determinants of
diseases), 2) endotypes of each cardiometabolic disease by clustering individuals within each disease
(determined as pathobiological mechanisms related to disease) and 3) endotypes of responsiveness to
bariatric surgery. To explore these overall study goals, the similarity network fusion method will be used along
with the consensus clustering approach. Specifically, this project aims to 1) create genetically predicted levels
of transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in 54,000 individuals in BioVU, use these predicted levels to
construct clusters of individuals and examine whether these clusters represent diseases using the BioVU
phenotype data, 2) construct clusters of individuals using direct measurements of multi-omics data
(transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) in over 5,000 individuals in TOPMed, construct genetically
predicted levels of the obtained clusters and impute them in BioVU using the BioVU GWAS data and explore
whether these predicted levels represent cardiometabolic diseases using phenotype data in BioVU and 3)
create metabolomic driven clusters using the plasma metabolomics data at baseline, 3 months and 12 months
post bariatric surgery in 104 patients, explore the association of the identified clusters with cardiometabolic
responsiveness and identify novel baseline metabolomic predictors of responsiveness to weight loss surgery .
The proposed study will leverage multilayered –omics data using a novel and innovative network modeling
analysis, providing Dr. Bagheri with critical skills, tools and experience to complete the research aims. This will
be achieved by the accomplishment of the following two training goals which will help her to become an
independent ‘big data’ cardiometabolic scientist: 1) gaining more in-depth knowledge of small molecule
metabolism in biologically-informed cardiometabolic disease subtypes and 2) gaining expertise and expand her
existing experience in bioinformatics and statistical multi-omics integration methods."

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiovascular anomaly and is associated with aortic
aneurysm and aortic dissection, a condition defined as BAV aortopathy. Although both BAV and BAV aortopathy
are thought to be highly heritable conditions, the causative clinical factors and genomic variants associated with
development and progression of this disease remain poorly understood. The aim of the current proposal is to
fill this knowledge gap through a three-pronged approach: 1) we will use an innovative statistical method
called Poisson binomial comorbidity discovery to define clinical and demographic variables associated
with BAV aortopathy; 2) we will develop a predictive model for BAV aortopathy risk using a state-of-the-
art artificial intelligence method called probabilistic graphical models; and 3) we will utilize detailed
pedigree-driven whole genome sequencing analysis of multigenerational families with a high prevalence
of BAV aortopathy and patients undergoing surgery for BAV aortopathy to define genetic variants
associated with BAV aortopathy. By combining a clinical risk model with an understanding of the genomic
variants associated with BAV aortopathy, we expect to gain novel understanding of the pathogenesis of this
highly impactful clinical condition. The information produced by this line of investigation has significant promise
to help refine the clinical paradigms for treatment of aortic disease by building a foundation to allow development
of precision medicine tools to predict aortic disease risk at the individual patient level. This line of inquiry, if
successful, will lead to improved clinical outcomes in these complex and heterogenous patients.
Through pursuit of the Research Aims of this proposal, Dr. Glotzbach will develop his expertise with the
fundamental skills of statistics, predictive modeling, epidemiology, bioinformatics, genomic analysis, and
research team leadership that will enable him to build a career as an independent translational investigator.

This project investigates a little-known physical property of ionizing radiation, which has the potential to increase
the therapeutic ratio of radiation therapy (RT). Several decades ago, it was observed that ionizing radiation could
nucleate gas nanobubbles (NBs) in water and other liquids. Seminal experiments revealed the presence of NB
in irradiated water, which manifested as a decrease in the ultrasound power required to achieve acoustic
cavitation. These results raise a crucial yet unanswered question: Does ionizing radiation nucleate NBs in vivo,
inside irradiated tissues? Radiation is widely used in medicine. The premise that NBs may be nucleated in
patients during diagnostic scans or radiation therapy is significant because NBs could induce biological effects.
In addition, their presence in the tissues may lower the threshold for acoustic cavitation, which suggest a novel
mechanism for increasing the efficacy of radiation therapy. The first Aim of this project is to gather rigorous and
comprehensive evidence of NB nucleation in irradiated cells in vitro. Sensitive assays, including darkfield
microscopy and ultrasound imaging, will be used to detect NBs in cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. This
study will generate quantitative estimates of the efficiency of NB nucleation for different types of radiation,
including their kinetics and stability under different conditions. The second Aim is to explore the use of radiation-
induced NB to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of RT. Given that exogenously administered NBs are already
used to increase the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), intrinsically induced NBs nucleated
during exposure to ionizing radiation should have similar enhancing effect for HIFU. Therapeutic efficacy of this
combined treatment will be assessed by treating multicellular tumor spheroids sequentially with RT and HIFU,
then quantitatively assessing the biological response of the cells. The proposed combination uses treatment
modalities approved for use in humans and requires no extrinsic agents to be administered. This combination of
radiation-induced NB nucleation and ultrasound-driven NB cavitation is a highly innovative and practical solution
to the issue of treatment-resistant tumors."
10808990,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer with extremely poor
prognosis. New approaches for improved treatment of this disease are desperately needed. Accumulating
evidence suggests that the lack of effective treatment for this disease is because the existing regimens cannot
effectively eliminate glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), the root of GBM development. One promising approach
to eliminating GSCs is to induce GSC differentiation. Unfortunately, the development of differentiation therapy
for GBM has been limited by our poor understanding of the biology of GSC differentiation. In this application,
we propose to characterize genetic regulation of GSC differentiation and validate genes that can be targeted
for effective GBM differentiation therapy. As preliminary work, we identified a group of genes, which potentially
regulate GSC differentiation toward specific lineages through a combination of RNAi screening and single-cell
RNA sequencing approach. In this application, we will characterize lead GSC differentiation regulatory
candidate genes in Aim 1, and to determine the therapeutic potential of selected genes for GSC differentiation
therapy in Aim 2. Success of this project will lead to identification of novel GSC differentiation regulators that
can be potentially targeted for improved treatment of GBM."

inflammation [3-6]. Our work to further study inflammation in this context has led to new data implicating
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome as a root cause of inflammation in the colon, circulation, and synovium that
culminates in accelerated OA degeneration in joints [7]. Changes include colonic, serum, and synovial
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, which parallel the expansion of Peptococcaceae and
Peptostreptococcaceae family members in the obese gut. Correction of this dysbiosis via dietary
supplementation with the indigestible prebiotic fiber oligofructose ablates these proinflammatory communities
while restoring an Actinobacteria taxa that is lost in obesity, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B.
pseudolongum). This correction leads to reduced inflammation in niches spanning from the colon to the joint,
reduced numbers of macrophages and B cells in the synovium, and protection against the development of OA
in the knee [7]. Moreover, we have discovered that oral delivery of a B. pseudolongum probiotic is joint
protective and the B. pseudolongum metabolome itself contains molecules that directly inhibit inflammation.
Based on these findings, we propose that 1) the OA of obesity is caused by a gut microbiome dysbiosis that
triggers an inflammatory cascade starting in the intestine and radiating to the joint, and 2) obesity-related OA
can be mitigated either by correcting the obese gut dysbiosis using methods to expand B. pseudolongum or by
commandeering its metabolites to reduce inflammation in the colonic epithelium where the obesity-related
inflammatory signature initiates. To investigate these concepts, we propose to address the following two
Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to establish that gut microbiome dysbiosis is causal in the OA of obesity, with the
hypothesis that the obese dysbiotic gut microbiome is the initiator of a systemic inflammatory cascade that
initiates in the colon, radiates to joints, and accelerates OA. Aim 2 is to study how B. pseudolongum protects
against joint degeneration in obesity, with experiments designed to test the hypothesis that B. pseudolongum
mitigates inflammation and is joint protective in the context of obesity and its metabolome contains
inflammation-suppressing agents. Completion of these aims will establish that the OA of obesity is an
inflammatory process driven by gut microbiome dysbiosis. Expansion of B. pseudolongum or delivery of its
metabolites could represent novel therapeutic approaches to address a disease of global scope that is
currently only treated palliatively."

 RNA quality control pathways play essential roles in ridding cells of defective RNAs that
arise from RNA damage, misprocessing, or transcription of pseudogenes. Much has been
learned over the past decades about the quality control pathways that monitor the integrity of
protein-coding messenger (m)RNAs, such as the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.
Much less is known about those quality control pathways that monitor non-coding (nc)RNAs,
which make up ≈95% of the cell's RNA and are susceptible to the same types of damage as
mRNAs. The primary goal of this research is to uncover the mechanisms whereby ncRNA
quality control pathways distinguish normal from defective RNAs, how the defective RNAs are
targeted for degradation, and what are the consequence of failures in these pathways to cell
function and human health.
 To address these questions we will over the next five years focus on the quality control
of abundant human stable small ncRNAs that are critical to cell function, including small nuclear
(sn)RNAs of the spliceosome and 7SL RNA of the signal recognition particle. We will take
advantage of the fact that 1,000s of pseudogenes of these RNAs exist in the human genome,
many of which produce defective ncRNA variants that must be detected and degraded by
quality control pathways. The features of these defective ncRNAs that are identified by quality
control pathways and the factors involved in their degradation will be uncovered through
targeted and global assays monitoring effects of degradation factor depletion and ncRNA
mutagenesis on the stability of the ncRNA variants. We recently uncovered a central role for 3'
end-processing machineries in one such quality control pathway that targets defective snRNAs,
and will therefore additionally over the next five years pursue RNA targets and potential roles in
RNA quality control of 3' end processing factors, including factors that when defective cause
human neurodegenerative disorders.
 These efforts should uncover principles by which defective human small ncRNAs are
detected and degraded by quality control pathways, a mostly unexplored yet critical aspect of
gene expression. These efforts also have the potential to provide insights into defects in RNA
processing that lead to human disease such as neurodegenerative disorders."

A growing body of research has found that neural representations are less distinctive in
older relative to younger adults, a phenomenon known as age-related neural
dedifferentiation. Neural dedifferentiation has been associated with many of the behavioral
impairments typically observed in healthy aging, and evidence collected by our group
during the original funding period has found a strong relationship between neural
dedifferentiation and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the brain’s major inhibitory
neurotransmitter. Specifically, we found that GABA levels are lower in older vs. younger
adults and that older adults with less GABA exhibit greater dedifferentiation. We propose
to take this line of research in two new directions. (1) We will conduct a longitudinal study
and explore age-related trajectories of change in GABA, neural distinctiveness, and
behavior, as well as directional relationships among these measures (e.g., Do GABA
levels at age 65 predict subsequent declines in neural distinctiveness? Does neural
distinctiveness at age 65 predict behavioral declines over the next decade). (2) We will
also examine how dedifferentiation is related to Alzheimer’s pathology by collecting the
same measures in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment in whom amyloid beta and tau
burden has already been measured. The proposed studies will provide novel insights into
how the brain changes with age and with neuropathology, whether those changes can
explain the observed behavioral deficits, and whether changes in GABA levels are a
contributing cause. Such insights could lead to novel interventions to alleviate the
behavioral impairments associated with healthy and pathological aging."

The need to train the next generation of medical geneticists has never been more urgent. Our biggest challenge
in Medicine is to handle the flood of genomic information associated with new methodologies such as next
generation sequencing. The overwhelming power of these new technologies is transforming the traditional
approach to medical diagnosis and functional investigations. This renewal training proposal will prepare the
future generation to tackle a new reality in which: 1) genetic testing and technology continues to develop rapidly,
2) much clinical testing is done outside of the medical genetics clinic, either by other specialists or direct-to-
consumer, 3) there is a growing understanding of the influence of genetics on a vast array of human disease,
and 4) precision medicine based on genetic/genomic insights will transform the therapeutic landscape. Our
UCLA Medical Genetics Post-Doctoral Training Program utilizes the outstanding, diverse faculty and facilities of
the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. The faculty of this program provides a wealth of research
opportunities, varying from basic molecular biology, genomics, cell biology, stem cell research, biochemical
genetics, cytogenetics, population genetics, to clinical genetics and dysmorphology. Our collaborative Faculty
will remain organized around three thematic areas: Genomic Medicine, Phenotyping in the Genomic Era, and
Treatment of Genetic Disease. Our current proposal includes 46 faculty members from 21 clinical and basic
science departments. These applicants and their mentors are united by a common goal: excellent scholarship
and leadership in human genetics research. We will provide our trainees with a broad knowledge of medical
genetics and an intensive experience in genetic research over a two-year period to prepare them to become
independent investigators, with a focus on linking basic science investigation in genetics to clinical medicine and
thus serve as future leaders. Major strengths of the training environment include a vibrant and growing clinical
genetics program with access to an ethnically varied population, state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratories in
cytogenetics, biochemical genetics, and molecular genetics, including a clinical genomics center that produces
exome sequencing, a wide variety of well-funded research laboratories, a longstanding training experience of
faculty, a specific postdoctoral course in medical genetics, an experienced associate director for diversity in order
to support the training of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented minorities and
individuals with disabilities, who can enrich our program and the field of medical genetics. While our program
has a 33-year history of success, the changes implemented in the program are focused squarely on the training
of future leaders using the modern technologies of genomics, and enthusiastically embraces the enormous
changes that new discoveries will bring."

Caries prevalence, morbidity, and associated disparities in children have been well documented nationally and
locally. Research now is trying to understand why these disparities persist. Caries risk for an individual is
considered a combination of genetics and behaviors (diet, oral hygiene, and fluoride exposure). The
Coordinated Oral Health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago Cohort Study will use the social ecological theory
lens to examine caries risk factors on multiple levels. CO-OP Chicago was previously funded by NIDCR to
reduce oral health disparities in children. The original CO-OP Chicago study [UH2DE02583] established
baseline estimates of tooth brushing behaviors and determined the feasibility of objective assessment of tooth
brushing behaviors in the homes of high-risk children under the age of three years old. CO-OP Chicago
[UH3DE025483] then recruited 420 child/caregiver dyads to participate in a two-arm, cluster-randomized
controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a family-focused CHW oral health intervention to improve tooth
brushing behaviors for young children. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported brushing frequency and
observed plaque score at 12-months. At entry into the study, the mean child age was 21.5 months. Forty-two
percent of participants described themselves as Black race, and 54% as Hispanic ethnicity. Most children
(89%) had Medicaid health insurance. CO-OP Chicago collected a range of self-reported and observed oral
health data as well as family psychosocial factors from these low-income families over one year. However, the
study did NOT include a caries assessment. The proposed CO-OP Chicago Cohort Study will transition
trial participants into a longitudinal cohort (minimum N=315) to determine multi-level predictors of oral
health behaviors and caries risk in low-income, urban young children over time. The CO-OP Chicago
Cohort Study uses the social ecologic model to organize oral health risk factors into individual (child),
interpersonal (family), organizational (healthcare), and community domains. We will collect four additional
years of data with data collection every six months that includes caregiver-reported and observed child oral
health behaviors, dental plaque scores, diet, parenting styles, dental provider access, and social risk factors.
We will also conduct two caries examinations on children at ages five and seven. Community-level data will be
extracted from public data sources. Specific Aim 1 is to examine associations between child, family,
healthcare, and community factors on young child home oral health behaviors (child brushing frequency and
plaque score) over time. Specific Aim 2 is to examine associations between child, family, healthcare, and
community factors on young child caries prevalence over time. Specific Aim 3 is to examine the mediating
effects of child brushing frequency and plaque score on the prior identified risk factors associated with caries
prevalence. An Exploratory Aim will determine the ability of plaque scores to predict risk of caries. These data
will advance our understanding of caries risk factors and inform future research and intervention development."

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the human brain and are critical for central nervous system
(CNS) development and function. Mature astrocytes are unusually elaborate cells, with an intricate and
ramified morphology. Their numerous fine cellular processes interact closely with synapses, neuronal cell
bodies, axons, blood vessels, and other glial cells throughout the CNS. Through these interactions, astrocytes
fulfil diverse functions to support and enhance neuronal activity, maintain CNS homeostasis, and modulate
circuits. Underscoring the importance of proper astrocyte development, defects in astrocyte growth or loss of
astrocyte complexity are implicated in many neurological diseases, including Alexander's disease, autism, and
epilepsy. However, it remains poorly understood how astrocytes develop their intricate morphological
associations and regulate neural circuit function.
Our long-terms goals are to understand how astrocyte acquire their remarkable morphology, target their
processes to synapses, and use these cell-cell contacts to modulate brain function. We recently performed a
genetic screen in Drosophila to identify new regulators of astrocyte development, and uncovered a novel gene,
Trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1), as required for astrocyte morphogenesis. We find that loss of Tre1 leads to
severely reduced astrocyte complexity in vivo, resulting in decreased infiltration of the synaptic neuropil. Tre1
encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with no known function in the CNS. This proposal will use a
synergistic combination of molecular-genetic tools available in Drosophila and zebrafish along with new tools
we have generated and in vivo imaging to: determine how Tre1 regulates astrocyte morphogenesis, function,
and animal behavior in Drosophila (Aim 1); elucidate signaling pathways upstream and downstream of Tre1
activation (Aims 1+2); and define the evolutionary conservation of Tre1 in vertebrates (Aim 3). Our work will
provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms regulating astrocyte development and function in vivo and
lay the foundation for understanding astrocyte growth and dysfunction in human disease."
10851006,"The cause of geographic atrophy (GA), a progressive dry form of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), is elusive and there is currently no therapy for this blinding disorder. Our
prior studies have demonstrated that RPE death is accompanied by attenuation of
choriocapillaris (CC). Like other tissues in the aging body, the choroid is undergoing low grade
chronic inflammation, termed inflammaging. This is logical because, in the GA choroid, there is
elevated complement C3a and 5a, as well as advanced glycosylation end products, and C-
reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an acute phase reactant and an active regulator of the innate
immune system that has been suggested by some to be a risk factor for AMD. There are also
two resident inflammatory cells in choroid, mast cells (MCs) and macrophages. We have
previously demonstrated that macrophages are activated in GA and MC numbers and the
number of degranulated MCs are increased in GA choroid.
 Our recent study demonstrated that simply degranulating MCs with slow-released 48/80
(a snake-venom like compound) causes a GA-like phenotype: degeneration of RPE, visual
function decline, and thinning of retina and choroid. In a pilot study, we observed that slow-
released subconjunctival CRP stimulated MC degranulation in rat choroid and RPE
degeneration. In the proposed studies, we investigate the effect of CRP at a physiologically
relevant level on the RPE/Bruchs membrane/CC complex in vitro and in our in vivo rat model.
 The proposed studies will determine if CRP, which is greatly elevated in AMD choroid,
acts directly on RPE or whether its effect is via activation of macrophages and/or mast cells. All
three cells express Fcγ receptors, which are some of CRP binding sites. If MC degranulation is
the cause of RPE degeneration, we will determine if MC granules or exosomes are responsible.
The RPE migration at the border of GA atrophy is presumed to be epithelial to mesenchyme
transition (EMT) but this has not been characterized and the cause of this event is unknown.
We will first determine if this is EMT in human GA and in our rat model. Then we will investigate
in vitro if CRP stimulates EMT directly or if CRP-induced MC degranulation is the cause.
 Our results will provide new opportunities for understanding GA pathology and
determine the role that choroidal CRP plays in GA. Our studies also have the potential of
identifying novel therapies for GA by quiescing MCs or by preventing CRP from binding its
FCγ receptors."
10909834,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use is a global health problem that often begins in adolescence/young adulthood. Despite extensive
research efforts, effective preventative and treatment measures remain elusive. While bi-directional associations
between alcohol use and brain function form the cornerstone of prominent neurobiological theories of addiction,
the reciprocal relationship between alcohol use and brain function remains underexplored. This 5-year K99/R00
proposal is designed to address this fundamental gap in knowledge, through the novel application of cutting-
edge techniques which overcome many of the limitations of between-subject cross-sectional designs, including
low reliability and small effect sizes. It is hypothesized that neurocognitive mechanisms of decision making which
underly elevated risk taking in adolescence (i.e., elevated reward processing relative to lower cognitive control)
contribute to alcohol use initiation in adolescence, as well as escalation and maintenance in young adults, and
that the consumption of alcohol in turn influences these same mechanisms, thereby promoting future use.
Crucially, this proposal is designed to support the applicant’s transition to independence through: 1) technical
training in advanced longitudinal and machine learning analysis, and the collection and analysis of precision
functional mapping (PFM) data, 2) training in assessments of alcohol use behavior in young adults, and 3)
professional and career development, including leadership and mentorship, grantsmanship, professional
networking, publication, and scientific presentations. Aim 1 (K99) will assess prospective long-term associations
between reward, cognitive control, and alcohol use in two large extant datasets of adolescents and young adults
(IMAGEN: ages 14-22, N=2000; ABCD: ages 9-18, N=11,000). Analyses will use multivariate neural signatures
of these processes, which are more reliable and sensitive to individual differences than regional estimates. Aims
2&3 (K99/R00) will collect the novel ALC-21 sample – a sample of college students who engage in heavy
episodic drinking (N=24), who will be scanned repeatedly (8-10 scans each) over a semester, immediately
following periods of elevated use (e.g., 21st birthday) and reduced use. The use of precision functional mapping
(PFM) – studying an effect with large within-subject variation by acquiring large quantities of imaging data per
subject – maximizes the neuroimaging signal, spatial resolution, and measurement reliability. PFM results in
robust and reliable within-subject brain-behavior associations. A subset of the full sample (N=5) will be collected
for Aim 2, and will be used to test the short-term effect of heavy episodic drinking on reward and cognitive
control. The remainder of the sample will be collected during the R00 portion for Aim 3, which will assess bi-
directional short-term associations between reward, cognitive control, and alcohol use. Together, these studies
will provide fundamental insights into the reciprocal relationship between alcohol use and brain function, both
over the long-term and in the short-term. Further, completing this training plan will prepare the applicant to lead
an innovative research program as an independent investigator."

With rates of mental health service utilization as low as 40%, racial and ethnic minority young adults with
serious mental illnesses (SMI) are at high risk for disengaging from mental health services. They experience
greater unmet need and increased risk for long-term health disparities, poverty, incarceration, and early
mortality. Disparities in treatment engagement are often driven by the lack of services that take into account
the unique developmental needs and relevant cultural factors that impact young adults’ on-going participation
in treatment. The PI’s preliminary findings among racial and ethnic minority young adults indicate that they
desired greater knowledge, appreciation, and support of their cultural identities from mental health providers.
However, there are few evidence-based treatment engagement programs for young adults with SMI, and none
that explicitly target both the developmental and cultural preferences of those who are racial and ethnic
minorities. This Career Development Award proposes a comprehensive path towards becoming an
independent clinician investigator adapting and optimizing evidence-based interventions to target cultural
determinants of health and reduce mental health disparities among adolescents and young adults. This proposal
uses the participatory ADAPT-IT framework to partner with racial and ethnic minority young adults with SMI
(n=15), providers (n=9), and expert mentors to adapt a brief, evidence-based young adult treatment
engagement intervention to include three new person-centered, cultural identity-focused components. The
adapted intervention will then be evaluated in a mixed-methods pilot optimization trial for feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary impact on treatment engagement at an urban, publicly-funded, adult psychiatric
rehabilitation program. The pilot comprises the preparation stage of the multiphase optimization strategy
(MOST), during which young adults (n=80) will be assigned to one of eight conditions to test new components
in an efficient factorial experiment. In-depth interviews administered post-intervention will contextualize and
clarify findings. To further her long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician investigator focused
on improving mental health services for underserved youth during the transition to adulthood, the PI will pursue
training in the following four areas: (1) developing empirically-driven engagement interventions for older
adolescents and young adults, (2) adapting interventions to be culturally relevant to underserved, minoritized
populations, (3) using MOST, and (4) grant writing. The product of this study will be an R01 of a large-scale
optimization trial powered to test intervention components for efficacy and change in targeted mechanisms of
treatment engagement. Overall, this award will ensure the PI’s successful transition to an independent
investigator with an established program of research focused on intervention development, adaptation, and
optimization for addressing mental health disparities in minoritized adolescents and young adults."
10830401,"The neural determinants of cognition are not well understood in the human brain and particularly elusive in
patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical disorders
often associated with impairments in social cognition, executive function, or language. FTD is typically caused
by frontotemporal lobar degeneration proteinopathies including tau or TDP-43 pathology not yet diagnosable
during life. Thus, identification of the neurons that selectively degenerate in FTD with tau (FTD-tau) and FTD
with TDP-43 (FTD-TDP) may be informative to the development of anatomically-grounded diagnostics and
neuroprotective therapeutics lacking in FTD. However, the clinical relevance of neuron loss remains unclear due
in part to clinicopathologic heterogeneity within the FTD spectrum. Another limiting factor is that traditional, low-
throughput methods preclude large-scale postmortem studies of FTD and rarely examine the cyto- or
myeloarchitectonic subdivisions of brain regions (e.g. cortical layers) where distinct neurons reside and
microcircuits connect local and distant regions.
My recent comparative study of cortical layer pathology found that tau and TDP-43 pathology accumulate distinct
laminar distributions in clinically similar FTD patients. However, the layer-specific neurons that accrue pathology
and the axonal pathways by which pathology may spread are understudied in FTD syndromes, despite the
compelling experimental evidence for trans-synaptic transmission of pathologic proteins in diverse networks. To
address these gaps in knowledge, the current project plans to examine laminar architecture to leverage the
unique cellular organization and connectivity of cortical layers to identify differential loss of laminar microcircuits
embedded in large-scale frontotemporal networks involved in FTD. I propose to develop a new high-throughput
approach to quantify laminar neuronal features comprising short and long-range microcircuits with inhibitory or
excitatory properties. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that tau and TDP-43 pathology will be related
to the loss of partly distinct laminar microcircuits in regional networks vulnerable to FTD, suggesting that different
neural microcircuits may contribute to similar cognitive impairments across the FTD spectrum.
My cortical layer framework is a unique approach to interrogate changes to laminar microcircuits, facilitating the
discovery of new disease-specific patterns of neurodegeneration within gross anatomical regions to identify the
neural substrates of pathologic subgroups and clinical symptoms of FTD. The differential loss of laminar
microcircuits in FTD is a conceptual paradigm for advancing the study of selective vulnerability at the mesoscale,
thereby serving as a critical bridge between emerging microscopic genetic expression data and macroscopic
network/connectome studies. Completing this project will require I obtain interdisciplinary training in machine
learning and segmentation methods, bioinformatics, and social cognition, all areas that will directly benefit my
transition to becoming an independent neuroscientist conducting translational research for dementia syndromes."
10878924,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined by irreversible airflow limitation, is the 3rd leading cause
of death globally and 4th in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major extrinsic COPD risk factor, but
despite six decades of declining smoking rates in many countries, the corresponding declines in COPD have
been modest. Only a minority of lifetime smokers develop COPD, and up to 25% occurs in never smokers.
While other factors have been linked to COPD much of the variation in COPD risk remains unexplained. In
addition, personalized risk and therapies are lacking for COPD, due to a lack of reliable COPD subphenotypes.
Airflow obstruction, or reduced airflow from the lungs, is determined in part by airway tree structure and lung
volume, both of which can be imaged with high precision by high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT)
scans. Emerging evidence by our group suggests that airway tree structure variation is common in the general
population and is a major contributor to this unexplained COPD risk. By manual labeling of the airway tree
structure, limited to one airway generation in just 2 of the 5 lung lobes (due to complexity of tree structure),
we found that 26% of the general population has major airway branch variants that differ from the classical
“textbook” structure, increase COPD risk, and have a strong and biologically plausible genetic basis. We further
demonstrated that airway tree caliber variation (dysanapsis) measured on CT was a stronger predictor of COPD
risk than all known risk factors including smoking. Yet there is no standardized approach to characterize the
full scope airway tree variation, making the exact relationship between COPD and individual airway-structure
features unclear. This proposal would apply for the first-time the power of machine learning methods to the
entire airway tree structure imaged on HRCT to build logically upon prior high-impact work to discover new
COPD subphenotypes for risk stratification and biological pathways of intervention.
Also, we will apply sophisticated / rigorous mathematical clustering approaches to airway trees derived from
over 18,000 computed tomography (CT) scans in three highly characterized NIH/NHLBI-funded cohorts – the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome
Measures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Study (SPIROMICS), and the Genetic Epidemiology of
COPD (COPDGene) Study, in addition to the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) – to
discover and replicate novel and clinically significant airway tree subtypes and their genetic basis.
The proposed study provides a transformative opportunity to define and validate normal and clinically relevant
tree variation in the general population and COPD cohorts. This research would result in robust, reproducible,
image based novel quantitative airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans, and understand their role in
COPD risk, prognosis, and their underlying genetic basis to help personalize COPD risk."

Transgender and other gender minority youth (TGMY) experience concerning rates of mental health problems,
self-harm, alcohol and drug use, sexual risk-taking, and violence victimization and perpetration. Minority stress
theory states that peer and family rejection and internalized transphobia predict deleterious health outcomes in
TGMY, underscoring the urgent need to identify effective programs that prevent psychosocial and behavioral
health issues among TGMY. Mentoring programs may be especially impactful for TGMY, given that these
programs may help alleviate adverse outcomes associated with peer and family rejection and promote self-
acceptance among TGMY. However, few mentoring programs exist specifically for TGMY, and those that do
have not been rigorously evaluated; often require guardian permission; generally occur in person via
community organizations which precludes TGMY in high stigma, rural areas of the United States from
accessing such programs; and rarely include evidence-based skill-building components (e.g., social-emotional
skills). The purpose of this innovative project is to develop and complete feasibility and pilot testing of a time-
limited synchronous group-delivered eHealth mentoring and skill-building program for TGMY (ages 14 to 17),
preliminarily entitled the Teen Connection Project (TCP). The TCP is expected to include seven 90-minute
sessions co-facilitated by two TGM adults (who are also mentors). TGMY will be paired with a TGM adult
mentor based on shared social identities and interests, and mentors and mentees will participate together in
each session along with other mentors and mentees. Mentors will direct activities and discussion to promote
TGMY social-emotional skills acquisition. The TCP sessions will include one-on-one mentor-mentee break-out
sessions. During the development phase, researchers will use an iterative process to create and refine the
TCP program materials through ongoing feedback from both a Youth Advisory Board and Expert Advisory
Board and conduct and open pilot trial (n=10). During the pilot evaluation phase, researchers will recruit 140
TGMY across the U.S. via social media sites and LGBTQ+ organizations and randomly assign TGMY to the
intervention condition (n=70) or wait-list control condition (n=70). Using similar methods, recruit 20 TGM adult
mentors from across the U.S. The researchers will (1) assess acceptability and feasibility of the program and
research procedures via program observations as well as post-session surveys and exit interviews with both
mentor and mentees; (2) generate initial data on the TCP’s efficacy in reducing mental health problems, self-
harm, alcohol and drug use, sexual risk-taking, and violence victimization and perpetration among TGMY; and
(3) examine treatment change mechanisms, including youth (e.g., increased social-emotional skills, reduced
minority stress) and relationship (i.e., increased bonding) intermediary outcomes among TGMY. TGMY will
complete a baseline survey and immediate and 3-month follow-up surveys. This study represents the first RCT
of a TGMY-specific mentoring program developed to prevent psychosocial and behavioral health issues."
10824274,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers. Leveraging clinical and basic
science expertise in PDAC and quantitative positron emission tomography (PET), we propose to evaluate a PET
tracer to quantify a targetable and potentially prognostic feature of PDAC, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),
in preclinical studies.
 Ring Finger Protein 43, RNF43, encodes for an E3 ubiquitin ligase commonly mutated in PDAC and high-
risk pancreatic precursor lesions, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). At MD Anderson,
we have developed a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC with pancreas-specific mutant Kras
expression and bi-allelic loss of Rnf43 (Kras;Rnf43 mice). Single-cell RNA sequencing of Kras;Rnf43 pancreata
reveals a striking enrichment for mitochondrial genes, including dramatically increased OXPHOS. In Preliminary
Studies, we have demonstrated that an inhibitor of OXPHOS activity extends the survival of Kras;Rnf43 mice
compared to vehicle-treated control. Quantitative relationships between pancreatic OXPHOS activity and
progression of precursor lesions to PDAC, as well as OXPHOS activity and response to OXPHOS inhibition, is
unknown, motivating our proposed studies.
 Here, we propose to quantify OXPHOS activity in vivo using a PET tracer targeting mitochondrial
membrane potential. While not previously evaluated in PDAC, a PET tracer of mitochondrial membrane potential,
18F-fluorobenzyl triphenylphosphonium (18F-BnTP), has shown utility for quantifying OXPHOS activity in mouse
models of lung cancer. We will leverage the elevated OXPHOS activity in tumors arising in Kras;Rnf43 mice, as
well as orthotopic allografts derived from these mice and human PDX models, to test two hypotheses, (1) that
elevated accumulation of 18F-BnTP is a property of Rnf43 mutation in PDAC and (2) that PET with 18F-BnTP
serves as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of response to an OXPHOS inhibitor. We propose three Specific Aims.
Aim 1: To evaluate tumor accumulation of 18F-BnTP in Kras;Rnf43 mice and Kras;p53-mutant (KPC) mice. Aim
2: To longitudinally evaluate 18F-BnTP accumulation in the pancreata of Kras;Rnf43 mice during multistep

inhibition.
 Translational Relevance. We will evaluate a clinically-translatable PET tracer in mice and patient-
derived tissues that may enable the prioritization of patients with PDAC for OXPHOS-inhibitor therapy and allow
optimization of therapeutic regimens targeting OXPHOS activity."
10866579,"Title: Molecular Basis for Myelodysplasia Induced by U2AF1 Mutations
Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematologic disorders characterized by cytopenia and dysplasia
of myeloid linage cells with an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Current therapies
are inadequate to treat MDS. This underscores a need to better understand the molecular mechanism of MDS
and identify new therapeutic targets in MDS. Mutations in the genes encoding RNA splicing factors (U2AF1,
SRSF2, SF3B1 or ZRSR2) are frequently observed in MDS. U2AF1 is involved in the recognition of the 3’
splice site required for recruitment of the U2 snRNP during pre-mRNA splicing. U2AF1 mutations have been
identified in ~11% cases of MDS. However, the functional roles of U2AF1 mutations in MDS and the
mechanism by which U2AF1 mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis remain unclear. To determine the
roles of mutant U2AF1 in MDS, we have generated a novel conditional U2AF1-Q157R knock-in mouse. In
preliminary studies, we have observed that hematopoietic expression of U2AF1-Q157R mutant results in a
macrocytic anemia, erythroid dysplasia and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow.
We also have observed that concurrent loss of EZH2 and expression of U2AF1-Q157R mutant promotes rapid
progression of MDS. We hypothesize that U2AF1 mutations trigger RNA splicing alterations, gene expression
changes, DNA damage and replication stress in HSPC leading to aberrant hematopoiesis, and U2AF1
mutations cooperate with epigenetic regulator mutations in the progression of MDS. To test our hypothesis, we
propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the consequences of U2AF1-Q157R mutation and
underlying molecular mechanisms in myelodysplasia. In Aim 2, we will determine the biological and molecular
basis for synergy between U2AF1 mutations and co-occurring epigenetic regulator mutations in the
pathogenesis of MDS. In Aim 3, we will identify and test therapeutic strategies for U2AF1 mutant MDS. Results
from these studies will provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and may lead to new
therapeutic approach for treatment of MDS."
10893382,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Every year, approximately 6,800 and 37,000 Black women in the United States die
from lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases, respectively. Most Black women diagnosed with lung cancer
and cardiovascular diseases are diagnosed at advanced stages, which are associated with significantly higher
mortality and greater healthcare-related costs. As such, strategies to increase the early detection of lung
cancer and cardiovascular diseases among Black women are urgently needed.
Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to result in earlier detection
of lung cancer and significant reductions in lung cancer mortality in two large randomized trials. Additionally,
research has shown that LDCT scans can be used to predict cardiovascular disease risk. Thus, LDCT lung
cancer screening offers an opportunity to increase the early detection of lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases
among Black women. However, while LDCT screening is recommended by the United States Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) for individuals classified as high-risk, current USPSTF screening eligibility
criteria exclude many Black women who are actually high-risk but do not meet the criteria. In our previous study
of participants in the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), we found that over 66% of Black women
diagnosed with lung cancer would have been ineligible for lung cancer screening under the 2021
USPSTF guidelines.
Lung cancer risk-prediction models can account for lung cancer risk factors other than age and smoking (e.g.,
COPD) and are a promising strategy to increase the number of high-risk Black women eligible for screening.
However, the effectiveness of such models in selecting high-risk Black women for screening has never been
studied prospectively. Given the tremendous potential for LDCT screening to increase the early detection of lung
cancer and cardiovascular diseases, studies investigating more effective approaches for lung cancer
screening among Black women are needed to enhance the benefits of screening among this population.
Our overall objective is to conduct a single-arm (n=400) pilot study of U.S. Black women participating in the
BWHS—a cohort of 58,973 self-identified Black women from across the U.S.—to examine the feasibility,
acceptability, and performance of LDCT screening among this population. We will recruit Black women aged >
50 years with any history of smoking. We aim to 1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of LDCT screening
among U.S. Black Women; 2) evaluate the performance of LDCT for lung cancer detection among our cohort
and compare it to U.S. Black women in the National Lung Screening Trial (historical control), and 3) validate a
deep learning image analysis pipeline for cardiovascular disease detection among our cohort.
The findings of this pilot study will provide a strong foundation for a large-scale study that further evaluates the
optimal risk-based screening strategies to select high-risk Black women for lung cancer screening. In addition,
the findings of this pilot study will provide preliminary data that can be used to inform a future large-scale study
using deep learning networks to predict cardiovascular risk on LDCT scans."
10894817,"Project Summary
Older adults vastly underutilize evidence-based preventive health services that are proven to reduce serious
illness, morbidity and mortality. In fact, fewer than half of adults aged 65 and older are up-to-date on evidence-
based cancer screenings and vaccinations recommended by expert committees (e.g., the USPSTF and
CDC/ACIP). Those at greatest risk for receiving poor preventive care include racial and ethnic minority groups
and persons of low socioeconomic status. Yet interventions to remedy this underutilization in older adults have
mostly targeted individual preventive health services, rather than the totality of services needed by patients.
The 2011 Medicare establishment of the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) is a great and underused opportunity to
respond to the National Cancer Institute's calls for multilevel interventions that address both the supply and
demand for vastly underutilized preventive health services. This free-to-the-patient AWV visit gives providers
dedicated time to focus on preventive health services.
We developed a multilevel intervention to increase AWV use that successfully increased AWV utilization in 3
small (2-5 provider) pilot practices. The intervention addresses the complexities of increasing AWVs at patient
(demand for services), provider (supply of services), and practice levels. It combines electronic health record
(EHR)-generated information and tools with practice redesign tools and approaches to inform providers and
patients about the preventive health services needed by individual patients. This proposal's goal is to conduct
a pragmatic trial to evaluate the effect of the intervention on increasing AWV and preventive health services
utilization. We will implement the intervention in geographically and racially/ethnically diverse community-
based practices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and academic health system practices. Practices include
small to mid-size primary care practices (including solo practices), which typically are under-represented in
research. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the effect of the intervention on use of a) AWVs and b)
USPSTF and CDC/ACIP-recommended preventive services in 3 different types of practice settings; 2)
Evaluate the effect of the intervention on reducing racial/ethnic disparities in AWV utilization; and 3) Evaluate
factors affecting implementation and sustainability of the intervention tools and approaches, implementation
strategies, and intervention effect in diverse patient settings. Implemented via video conferencing and remote
deployment of EHR tools, this low-cost intervention could easily be disseminated to small and solo practices
across the country. The anticipated increase in patient use of preventive health services will improve
population health and lower mortality, particularly in at-risk racial/ethnic minority patients."

Recruitment, training, and retention of a diverse biomedical and clinical workforce is an essential component of
any comprehensive approach aimed at advancing health and health equity. Importantly, while several
organizations, including professional societies, develop trainee-focused programs, relatively few focus on the
unique needs of minorities underrepresented in life sciences, specifically in biomedical and clinical research
particularly throughout critical career transitions. To meet this need, the Endocrine Society developed the
Future Leaders Advancing Research in Endocrinology (FLARE) Program, a multi-faceted training program
for minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, clinical fellows, and early-stage faculty involved in
endocrine-related research. The objective of the program is to actively foster the professional development of
these early-stage investigators to enhance their preparedness for career advancement within research-based
institutions, the scientific community at large and to develop them as future leaders of the Endocrine Society
itself. Program components include a leadership training workshop, a virtual community, a mentoring program
to build relationships between FLARE fellows and dedicated mentors, a Society-based internship, and a
fellow/alumni symposium. Fellows selected for the internship participate in a governance committee of the
Society and develop mentoring skills by engaging with undergraduate students participating in the Society’s
summer research fellowship program and by visiting minority serving institutions to give seminars and host
mentoring workshops. The FLARE Program also collaborates with other established diversity, inclusion, and
outreach initiatives such as the Keystone Symposia Fellows Program, and the Network of Minority Research
Investigators of the NIDDK, that provide additional opportunities for networking and career advancement in
addition to identifying mentors and new FLARE faculty. Thus, the FLARE Program provides early career
minority investigators with unique and targeted professional development and enhancement opportunities that
prepare them to succeed and emerge as leaders in biomedical and clinical research careers."
10816537,"ABSTRACT
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Understanding
the process of atherosclerosis and its progression is essential to decrease ASCVD burden. Despite successful
identification of genetic variants and clinical risk factors related to ASCVD over the last decade, the underlying
mechanism - how genetic variants and human metabolism contribute to atherosclerosis remains unclear.
Circulating metabolites, the ultimate products of gene and environment interaction, holds promise to link genetic
variants, circulating metabolites to atherosclerosis. We previous work has shown that circulating metabolites
involved in lipids and oxidation metabolism and their genetic determinants predict the onset of ASCVD. Few
studies have examined the metabolic influence on atherosclerosis in multi-ethnic populations, and the effect of
longitudinal metabolomic changes on atherosclerosis. Our overall objective is to identify circulating metabolite
and its longitudinal change, along with the genetic determinants, contributing to atherosclerosis and ASCVD in
middle and late life among multi-ethnic populations. We propose to conduct this project in six studies from the
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, including European, African and Hispanic Americans.
We will leverage the unique resources from each study on whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, metabolome
profiles, and atherosclerotic traits, and use TOPMed Cloud Computing as the computational engine. Our aims
are: (1) to identify circulating metabolite and it change associated with ASCVD risk; (2) to determine circulating
metabolite and it change associated subclinical atherosclerosis and its progression; and (3) to characterize
genetic architecture of ASCVD metabolites and evaluate its association with ASCVD risk. Our team is uniquely
positioned, given our expertise in ASCVD pathophysiology, metabolome profiling, genomics, biostatistics and
bioinformatics. The results of this research will enable continued scientific progress toward an understanding of
ASCVD etiology, with direct implications for prevention and potential therapies."
10840451,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The pipeline of physician-scientists from underrepresented populations in the biomedical workforce remains
leaky. In gastroenterology, only 4 percent of academic faculty are African American, and 6 percent are
Hispanic/Latinx. American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian physicians represent less than 0.2
percent of all academic faculty positions. These numbers are significantly lower than the representation of
these groups within the overall U.S. population. A 2020 survey conducted by the Intersociety Group for
Diversity, a working group of representatives from five digestive disease professional associations including
the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), illustrated that the primary impediment to success for
physician-scientists from underrepresented populations remains a lack of effective and accessible mentoring.
AGA has a long and successful record of professional development programs designed to improve the
diversity of the research workforce in gastroenterology. AGA has implemented NIDDK-funded programs to
promote the recruitment and retention of underrepresented physician-scientists in gastroenterology since 2001.
Our current program, FORWARD began in 2018 and has demonstrated success in advancing the diversity of
the biomedical workforce with a focus on research skills development, leadership skills development, and
effective mentoring. This competitive renewal application, FORWARD 2.0, proposes to leverage the successes
of the original program with an enhanced focus on 1) manuscript writing and grant-writing training for both
program alumni and current cohorts with tracks specific to NIH K or R01 grant writing, 2) leadership
development and support focused on training and transitioning alumni and current cohort participants to
assume leadership positions within AGA's professional society committee structures and academic medicine
and 3) intensive mentoring from an expanded team of mentors, including senior mentors, home institution
mentors and near-peer mentors, and using mobile app-based mentoring technology."
10825582,"SUMMARY
Here in this UG3/UH3 proposal, we aim to develop a new single-cell whole-genome amplification
chemistry that allows high-accuracy and high-coverage detection of somatic mutations in single
cells and the dual-omics assay that combines the high-accuracy and high-coverage genome
profiling assay with the single-cell transcriptome assay (UG3). And in the UH3, we aim to scale
up the throughput of the scDuplex-seq assay and the related dual-omics assay on the
picoinjection-based droplet platform and validate this platform for different tissue types that are
going to be profiled for somatic mosaicism by SMaTH program at the large scale. Understanding
the heterogeneity of the blueprint of life at single-cell resolution is critical for our understanding of
many fundamental biological processes such as aging and human diseases such as cancer and
neurodegeneration. Hence, the successful development of the proposed single-cell method is
important for reaching the goals of profiling somatic mosaicism set by the SMaHT program
considering that somatic mutations, to our knowledge, are the most frequently occurred type of
somatic variants. With the successful method development, we can determine the overall somatic
mutation burdens in single cells and the variations among them. Going beyond characterizing the
levels of somatic mutations, we can also effectively construct a lineage tree for all the sequenced
single cells. And we expect that there will be phenotypic differences between different branches
of the lineage tree, which correspond to different clones in our body, as recently observed in the
regional dissection-based studies. Upon identifying the different branches/clones, we can
characterize those phenotypic differences between them. The proposed dual-omics assay will
provide the exact tool for this characterization. In terms of our major strategy in developing an
accurate high-coverage genome profiling method, we will apply specialized transposition
chemistry to genomic DNA, which results in duplex-DNA with very uniform fragment size,
maximizing the recovery of these fragments in the downstream chemistry. Our major technical
specialty in scaling up the throughput is the picoinjection droplet system that essentially allows
the implementation of complicated chemistry onto the droplet system. The collaborative
experience between Zong lab and Weitz lab has also been proven to be productive in the
development of the droplet scTotalRNA-seq. Our ultimate goal of this proposal is to produce a
lineage tree with a large number of cells (³1000) with both accurate characterizations of somatic
mutations and the transcriptome in single cells, hence providing the proof of concept picture for
future large-scale profiling by Genome Characterization Centers of the SMaHT program."
10844466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology via imaging and fluid-based
biomarkers in individuals with little to no evidence of cognitive decline allow for the targeted enrollment
of participants who are most likely to show benefit from early interventions. However, many of these
biomarkers are costly and invasive. As a result, more accessible, performance-based measures of
cognitive function are needed to improve early detection, aid in recruitment for clinical trials, serve as
clinical endpoints for interventions, and improve access to individuals from underserved communities.
In this R01 proposal, we respond to this need: by leveraging existing longitudinal data of over 3,000
speech samples from two large cohorts, we propose validation of a digital speech marker across all
ADRD stages. Connected speech and language (CSL) analysis of digitally recorded speech—the
detailed measurement of everyday spoken language—is a noninvasive digital marker that measures
communication, an activity essential for quality of life. Advances in natural language processing and
Machine Learning have made automated linguistic analysis a rapid and effective means for analyzing
CSL, while the ubiquity of mobile devices makes remote and frequent digital speech collection widely
accessible to more people at risk for AD. Our central objective is to further develop, increase
accessibility, validate, and improve the sensitivity of digital speech markers to AD through new analytic
approaches and remote collection methods. By pursuing the following specific aims on a large-scale
dataset, we investigate early changes in CSL to predict how and when CSL relates to the risk of
developing ADRD: Aim 1: Validate connected speech and language measures from older adults across
multiple stages of ADRD, including prodromal ADRD, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Aim 2:
Test the hypothesis that connected speech and language measures are associated with AD
biomarkers, including Aβ and tau from PET imaging, levels of tau, Aβ, and neurodegeneration (NFL) in
CSF and blood plasma, and global neurodegeneration from MRI. Aim 3: Evaluate the usability and
accessibility of frequent, remote at-home speech collection and validate linguistic metrics collected
remotely against those obtained in person. The results of these three aims will lead to a larger goal of
understanding the CSL features that are sensitive to cognitive decline and AD neuropathology in at-
risk adults, and the linguistic and acoustic markers necessary to develop a widely accessible tool
measuring early cognitive change along the ADRD continuum."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), is common in
COVID-19 and was a major driver of the now >1 million deaths in the USA since March 2020. Rigorous work
has emphasized the key role the immune system and the microbiome plays in lung diseases like ALI. This
includes an important role for pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which expand and increase their
activation in lung tissue during ALI and lead to pulmonary fluid accumulation. While select gut bacteria can induce
Th17 cells, the causal role of the microbiome in ALI and ARDS remains a major knowledge gap.
 Bifidobacterium adolescentis is a gut isolate with the highest Th17 inducing capacity of any human gut
bacterium. My own preliminary data show that colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with B. adolescentis is
sufficient to markedly alter the expression of many genes in lung tissue, including hundreds of genes implicated
in ARDS. My data also indicates that B. adolescentis and other bifidobacteria secrete small molecules that
activate Th17 cells, providing a plausible mechanism by which bifidobacteria could contribute to lung injury. My
K08 application will build on a set of tools based on our laboratory’s recent discovery that the host ketone body,
β-hydroxybuytrate (βHB), uniquely suppresses the growth of Bifidobacterium species.
 I hypothesize that Bifidobacterium, which are suppressed by gut epithelial βHB, secrete small molecules
that reach lung tissue and activate Th17 cells during ALI. The proposed research plan will provide multiple
training opportunities leading to a unique and sustainable research program. As a clinical fellow in the Turnbaugh
lab (UCSF), I have learned microbiome data analysis, anaerobic microbiology, and gnotobiotic mouse
husbandry. This project, coupled to in-depth support by lung experts Drs. Sheppard and Matthay (UCSF), will
help me develop an independent research area that builds upon my past training. I will develop skills quantifying
ALI severity in two ALI models and pair these ALI models with state-of-the-art tools in microbiome research.
 This proposal is both technologically and conceptually innovative. We will leverage resources available
in our laboratory to selectively manipulate Bifidobacterium colonization levels in conventionally raised mice using
βHB. My proposed experiments will help elucidate the metabolites produced by gut Bifidobacterium that induce
pulmonary Th17 phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of considering bacterial metabolism for immune
function and lung physiologic impairment. Our proposed studies will shift the focus to remote communication
between prevalent human gut bacteria and lung tissues, mediated by secreted bacterial metabolites. For patients
with ALI, this work will define putative mechanisms by which gut microorganisms contribute to devastating
physiologic impairment and provide a conceptual basis to understand the scope and molecular impact of the gut
microbiome on lung function in both health and disease."

 A major goal of our laboratory is to delineate regulatory mechanisms that control adipocyte development
and systemic physiology in obesity and diabetes. This proposal will address a new regulatory pathway
involved in adipose tissue adipose depot-specific energy expenditure. Understanding how metabolic tissues
store and utilize lipids is of central relevance to normal physiology, obesity and diabetes. Excess neutral lipids
are stored in lipid droplets (LDs)–dynamic organelles that expand and shrink depending on the metabolic
needs of the cell. The molecular mechanisms that link lipid LD dynamics and function to tissue metabolism are
incompletely understood. Defining the molecular pathways that govern fuel utilization in tissues is important for
understanding systemic homeostasis and the underlying causes of pathological lipid accumulation in the
setting of metabolic disease. We have identified Clstn3, an adipose tissue- and liver-selective product of the
Clstn3 gene, as a key determinant of multilocular LD morphology and function. Clstn3 is an integral ER
membrane protein that localizes to ER-LD contact sites via conserved hairpin-like domains. Loss of Clstn3 in
mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases LD size, reduces triglyceride utilization, and leads to cold-
induced hypothermia. Conversely, ectopic expression of Clstn3 in adipocytes is sufficient to reduce LD size
and enforce a multilocular LD phenotype. Collectively, these initial discoveries have revealed a previously
unrecognized molecular mechanism that maximizes LD surface area and facilitates lipid utilization in
thermogenic adipocytes and potentially other cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to further define the
mechanisms of Clstn3 action and its contributions to metabolic physiology. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate
mechanisms by which Clstn3 regulates LD structure and function. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the ability of
Clstn3 to modify white adipocyte function. Specific Aim 3 will define the role of Clstn3 in lipid metabolism in
other tissues. These studies are expected to provide fundamental insight into pathways regulating LD function
and may suggest opportunities for modulating lipid utilization in the setting of metabolic disease."

One crucial barrier mechanism via which the skin defends against microbial infection involves the innate
immune function of the epidermis. This function is partly mediated by Langerhans cells (LCs), which are a skin-
specific resident dendritic cell (DC) subset. We found that LCs contribute to the cutaneous immune response
to Mycobacterium leprae (mLEP, the causative agent of leprosy) via a CD1a-restricted antigen presentation
pathway to T cells, which reflects correlations with the self-limiting vs. the progressive clinical forms of leprosy .
CD1a+ LC also increase during reversal reactions (RR), when patients upgrade from the lepromatous to the
tuberculoid pole. Our findings during the past 4 years of funding reveal new paradigms: 1) autophagy links
antigen presentation to antimicrobial activity in LCs; 2) LC-intrinsic antibacterial mechanisms and mechanisms
by which CD1a-restricted T cells kill bacteria in LCs; and 3) novel evidence that CD1a-restricted T cells
recognize microbial peptides. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CD1a-restricted presentation of
microbial peptide antigens induces T cell dependent antimicrobial pathways in infected LCs. We propose to
use leprosy as a model to examine this new concept that CD1a-restricted T cell and LC immunobiology are
linked in host defense in skin. We propose to: 1) determine intrinsic pathways by which activated LC kill
intracellular bacteria, 2) investigate the mechanisms by which CD1a-restricted T cells kill mLEP in LC; and, 3)
define mechanisms by which LC process and present CD1a-restricted bacterial peptides to T cells. These
studies are intended to provide a comprehensive and in-depth view of CD1-restricted T cell function and LC
biology in relation to a model of human skin disease, leprosy. The goal is to understand mechanisms of host
defenses against microbial pathogens in skin."

 The goal of the Administrative Core is to promote an environment of communication and collaboration
among Penn State TCORS investigators, across TCORS, and with CASEL and FDA and NIH staff. To
accomplish this, the Core will work closely with our TCORS components to establish the governance
procedures, prioritization, interaction, feedback and communication within the TCORS including its affiliate
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Administrative Core will oversee the fiduciary, ethical
and legal responsibilities of the TCORS and its members. The Core will manage and assume responsibility for
responding to the prioritizations of the FDA, NIH and the TCORS funding opportunity announcement. This
includes the conduct of scientific studies within the scientific domains of the RFA, forming an External Advisory
Board (EAB) and arranging for annual meetings with NIH officials and the EAB. The Core will assume the
responsibility for the Center’s rapid response capability, and adhering to recommendations and requests from
the EAB, the Internal Advisory Board, CASEL, national TCORS working groups and initiatives. The
Administrative Core will work to be at the forefront of FDA tobacco regulatory law, utilizing its EAB and Admin
Core experts in regulatory law and tobacco regulatory science to guide our activities. The Core will encourage
TCORS members to assume leadership positions in the national TCORS initiatives on working groups,
webinars and other venues. The TCORS will be supported by the Penn State College of Medicine Center for
Research on Tobacco and Health, which facilitates and coordinates tobacco research across the Departments
and Graduate training programs in the College of Medicine
 The Steering Committee includes faculty members who have collaborated for many years on tobacco
control and interdisciplinary tobacco research. The Steering Committee will meet at least weekly to insure that
the Center adheres to state of-the-art science, its integrative theme, and make recommendations for changes
in direction if necessary. The Core will insure that all activities, including career development, pilot projects,
major projects, and collaboration with other TCORS are responsive to FDA regulatory needs and its authority.
Based on the Penn State TCORS (2014-2019), which included many of the same PIs and Co-Is, we have had
significant experience in the administration of a TCORS both locally and nationally. A key component of the
Core is overseeing the Career Enhancement and Training Core. Our previous TCORS had over 20 trainees,
many of which have received their own funding including NIH training grants, are now fully employed at the
FDA Center for Tobacco Products, or have attained faculty positions at Penn State or elsewhere. The Career
Enhancement Training Program is led by two former trainees, who are now faculty, and well positioned to
continue the training and career development of the next generation of tobacco regulatory scientists."

Venous thromboembolism is a major global health and economic burden with about 10 million cases occurring
every year, and a high lifetime risk of 8% after age 45 years. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous
thromboembolic event associated with high morbidity and mortality, with about 20% incidence of death before
diagnosis or shortly thereafter. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a marked increase in
patients presenting with acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, most likely created when the infectious
vasculitis involving the endothelium creates local arterial thrombosis and subsequent lung infarction, with a
superimpose hypercoagulable state that promotes clot formation. In these patients, it is increasingly being
recognized that pulmonary perfusion abnormalities associated with the lung consolidations and ground-glass
opacities are important predictors of poor prognosis. Currently, pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) has become
the preferred method for diagnosing PE and planar lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is used in cases
when pulmonary CTA is contraindicated. A compelling unmet clinical need is to develop a method for
simultaneous pulmonary CTA and parenchymal perfusion assessment without the use of two modalities like CTA
and SPECT perfusion in the same patient. In this project, an imaging physics-based deep learning method will
be developed to extract the previously overlooked spectral information inherently encoded in the acquired
contrast enhanced CT projection data. As a result of this breakthrough, this new spectral CT imaging method,
referred to as Deep-En-Chroma, will be developed and validated for perfusion defect quantification in lung
parenchyma from the currently available pulmonary CTA. This will be accomplished without the need for any
expensive dual energy CT (DECT) hardware upgrades that have been commercialized by major CT
manufacturers. In summary, upon the completion of this project, a new functional CT imaging method will have
been developed, that in addition to providing the currently available pulmonary CTA images, will also detect
perfusion defects in lung parenchyma without the requirement of high-end DECT hardware."

10872124,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the subcellular site of secretory and membrane protein synthesis
and performs critical functions in secretory/membrane protein biogenesis and cellular proteostasis. In addition
its established role in secretory/membrane protein synthesis, recent studies examining the mRNA
transcriptomes of cytosolic and ER-bound ribosomes reveal that cytosolic protein transcripts are broadly
represented on the ER, with ribosome footprinting analyses demonstrating translation of cytosolic protein
mRNAs on ER-associated ribosomes. These findings identify an unexpected mRNA transcriptome-wide
function for the ER in proteome expression and reopen fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms
regulating mRNA localization and translation on the ER. Principally, where current models posit that mRNA
localization to the ER is co-translational and signal sequence-dependent, the abundant presence and
translation of cytosolic protein mRNAs on the ER indicates that either alternative and/or multiple pathways
mediate mRNA localization to the ER. As well, and although SRP pathway function in protein translocation is
well established, the question of SRP pathway function in mRNA localization to the ER remains largely
unexplored. Also of significance, the recent findings that a number of translocon-associated proteins, including
Sec61α,β, TRAPα, ribophorin I, and p180, are mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) suggest previously
unappreciated roles for ER resident RBPs in the biology of RNA localization and translation on the ER.
 This proposal merges three primary research themes of our laboratory; SRP pathway function in mRNA
and ribosome localization to the ER; ii) ER-localized translation initiation as a mechanism of localized protein
synthesis, and iii) RNA binding protein function in RNA localization and translational regulation, to address new
questions regarding cellular mechanisms of mRNA and ribosome localization to the ER. Building on the past
decade and a half of our research into RNA localization and translational regulation on the ER, including
founding evidence identifying an mRNA transcriptome-wide role for the ER in cellular proteome expression, the
proposed research will utilize mammalian tissue culture cell systems, gene editing and silencing approaches,
RNA-seq and Ribo-seq transcriptome analyses, HITS-CLiP and PAR-CLIP studies of ER RNA binding proteins
and their RNA interactomes, and biochemical analyses of the subcellular organization of the translation
machinery, to obtain new insights into the cellular organization and regulation of proteome expression. This
research is expected to advance understanding into the systems and pathways governing post-transcriptional
gene expression in the cell. In emphasizing in vivo analyses and native biosynthetic approaches to the study of
RNA and ribosome trafficking dynamics, this research is significant in its efforts to rigorously test existing
paradigms and advance understanding of cellular mechanisms of localized protein synthesis."

areas that are robust and merit policy and clinical attention. Unfortunately, research of AAPI populations suffers
considerable limitations. First, few studies report on AAPI populations and those that do, usually aggregate to
“Asian” or “Asian American and Pacific Islander”, masking the biological and sociocultural heterogeneity. Sec-
ond, sociodemographic and neighborhood factors are rarely available for studies of hospital quality at childbirth.
Third, lack of multilevel adjustment undermines the validity of comparative assessments of quality by penalizing
hospitals that care for vulnerable populations.
To understand disparities in care processes and outcomes for AAPI mother/infants, we will undertake a compre-
hensive appraisal of the multilevel factors associated with quality of care during the birth hospitalization, promote
fairer comparisons by making sociodemographic and neighborhood influences explicit; and assess key areas of
quality using key performance metrics for care provided to mothers, low-risk newborns, and infants born very
low-birth-weight (VLBW; <1500g).
Innovative methods include leveraging our unique multilevel data sources to provide comprehensive assess-
ments of hospital quality for AAPI populations with unprecedented granularity, assessing quality via key indi-
vidual and composite measures, and using a mixed-methods approach to provide unique insights into the
mechanisms by which sociocultural and neighborhood factors optimize or degrade quality. Specific aims:
1) Test for disparities in care processes and outcomes among AAPI mothers and infants and identify associations
with patient and neighborhood level social risk factors;
2) Assess the impact of hospital performance on care processes and outcomes of AAPI maternal/infant popula-
tions; and
3) Understand the birth and birth hospitalization experiences of AAPI populations alongside drivers of disparities
in care processes and outcomes.
An exceptional strength of our proposal is our ability to leverage the unique infrastructure of the California Peri-
natal and Maternal Quality Care Collaboratives. Building on our prior work in linking complimentary high-quality
clinical, administrative, and survey-based data sets containing multi-level factors, we will study a large popula-
tion-scale AAPI sample of 1.6 million mothers and newborns (including ~8,000 VLBW infants) in 238 maternity
hospitals and 138 neonatal intensive care units in California between 2011-23. Results of this proposal are
expected to have an immediate positive impact because in leveraging our expertise as active quality improve-
ment organizations, they are designed to identify pragmatic areas where hospitals and communities can improve."
10891648,"Cellular metabolism is emerging as a critical factor to control the immune responses and their impact on the
pathogens. In addition, recent studies pinpoint a more prominent role of the aberrant metabolism in controlling
both genetic and epigenetic cellular phenomena of any form of cancer. Thus, investigating the dynamic metabolic
shift in immune cells upon pathogenic infection and temporal ‘reactomics’ (defined as a combination of reaction
mechanisms, regulations, and kinetic parameters) and associated vulnerabilities of tumor cells holds immense
potential to develop novel therapeutic approaches. While the existing multi-scale modeling of immune cells tries
to bridge the gap between multiple scales (i.e., molecular to organ-level), none of the existing approaches can
simultaneously do that by building a proper, predictive ‘full-scale’ model. Furthermore, whether or to what extent
metabolic shifts occur in the host’s immune system is still not known. In case of cancer cell, some of the critical
challenges include defining the systems-level cellular metabolic phenotype and tracking the temporal changes
in reactomics which are critical for reverting the cell metabolism to more healthy state. Herein, PI Saha proposes
to develop and iteratively improve a systems-level, comprehensive, and integrative metabolic modeling
framework: i) to dissect the dynamic shifts in the immunometabolic responses associated with pathogenic
Infection, and ii) investigate the changes in temporal reactomics associated with the metabolic reprogramming
in a specific cancer cell. The proposed research program will leverage the unique combination of computational
modeling skills and rich research experience in Saha’s laboratory that are crucial for characterizing the metabolic
phenomena associated with any disease. His research team recently developed the first computationally
tractable and accurate modeling framework to track the temporal dynamics of cellular metabolism and also
established a new method to estimate the reactomics of each of the metabolic reactions involved in a cellular
system when ‘omics’ datasets are incomplete or missing and, thereby, develop a predictive kinetic modeling
framework. Thus, the proposed modeling framework can potentially investigate the metabolic dynamics
associated with a cluster of cells (e.g., immune cells) interacting with a pathogen or the temporal reactomics of
a specific cell (e.g., cancer cell). As a first step, Saha will investigate the dynamic metabolic shifts in a specific
type of immune cell (i.e., macrophage) upon SARS-Cov-2 and Staphylococcus aureus infection and the temporal
reprogramming and reactomics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell metabolism and test the
hypothesis that if the degree to these changes gives rise to the severity of the disease symptoms. Overall, the
proposed framework as well as the associated ‘predictome’ database (containing the predictions of key
genes/proteins/reactions playing critical roles) will provide the broader scientific community including molecular
biologists, computational biologists, clinicians, and translational scientists with a basic understanding of the role
of metabolism in dictating disease severity and also a useful template to investigate other diseases."

Mitochondria operate as a central hub for many metabolic processes by sensing and responding to the cellular
environment to maintain homeostasis. Consequently, their disruption is a key factor in the onset and progression
of many human conditions, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.
Mitochondrial homeostasis is primarily maintained through the recycling of damaged mitochondria by targeted
autophagy, termed mitophagy. Mitophagy is tissue-specific and occurs in response to both cellular stress and
differentiation cues. Differentiation-cued mitophagy is often termed programmed mitophagy and has recently
gained attention for its contribution to epigenetic status, cell fate decisions, metabolic adaptation and
differentiation. Although these and other effects have been attributed to mitophagy, little is known about the
upstream signaling pathways that induce mitophagy to meet specific cellular needs. Distinct morphological
differences in mitochondria exist during the post-natal stages of mammary gland development. This suggests
that mitophagy plays an important to the development of this tissue. Identifying the mechanism by which
mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained during mammary gland development will provide much needed insight
into the broader role of mitochondrial adaptation in normal development and disease. We have shown that
Singleminded-2s (SIM2s; expressed from Sim2), is differentially expressed during mammary gland development
and is a key regulator of functional mammary gland differentiation. Our recent results utilizing mammary gland-
specific over- and under-expressing Sim2s transgenic mice show that SIM2s is required for functional lactation,
and does so, in part, through direct interaction with the PRKN mitophagy complex. Based on these new results,
we hypothesize that mitophagy-dependent mitochondrial adaptation is essential for mammary gland functional
differentiation and that SIM2s is required to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. To address this hypothesis we
propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the mitophagy-driven metabolic transition required for
mammary epithelial cell differentiation by crossing the mito-QC mouse model with MMTV-Sim2s and Sim2fl/fl
mice to assess mitophagy and mitochondrial architecture and metabolic adaptation. In Aim 2, we will define the
physical basis for, and functional outcomes of, interactions between SIM2s, ATM, PINK1/PRKN, and LC3 in
mitophagy and mammary gland differentiation. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into
heretofore unknown mechanisms of mitochondrial adaptation under physiological conditions. We expect results
from these studies will help define the mechanism of mitochondrial adaptation in mammary gland development,
lactation, and cancer."

Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable mortality for people receiving medication treatment for opioid
use disorder (MOUD). Individuals receiving MOUD have a five-fold higher prevalence of tobacco smoking and
substantially lower quit rates than the general population, even when using existing treatments such as FDA-
approved pharmacotherapies. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), if substituted for combusted cigarette
smoking, may offer a harm reduction strategy for individuals receiving MOUD who smoke (MOUD-TUD) who
are not ready to quit smoking. Little work has been done to test this approach in MOUD-TUD. Addressing this
knowledge gap has the potential to answer a critical question of whether e-cigarettes can reduce tobacco use
and exposure in this highly vulnerable smoker population. It can also inform clinical practice and policymaking
decisions. In this 3-year career development award, I propose to conduct a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled
trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of substituting the NIDA standardized
research e-cigarette (SREC) for combusted cigarettes in MOUD-TUD who are not ready to quit smoking. A
waitlist controlled RCT using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design will investigate the impact of
SREC provision on: 1) tobacco use behavior (e.g., cigarettes per day [primary outcome], SREC use), 2)
biomarkers (e.g., carbon monoxide, anabasine), 3) cigarette dependence and withdrawal, and 4) short-term
health effects and tolerability (e.g., respiratory symptoms, substance use). In the proposed RCT, N=40 adults
stable on MOUD with buprenorphine who report daily smoking recruited from MGH primary care practices will
be randomly assigned to receive the SREC for 8 weeks, either immediately (iSREC), or after an 8-week delay
(waitlist control [WLC]). They will be followed an additional 4 weeks after SREC provision ends (to 12 weeks in
iSREC and 20 weeks in WLC). Each scientific aim corresponds to a specific training goal in three competency
domains: 1) design and conduct of clinical trials, 2) longitudinal quantitative data analysis and, 3) qualitative
and mixed-methods research. The scientific and training aims will be executed with mentorship from Drs.
Nancy Rigotti and Eden Evins (co-primary mentors), Dr. Elyse Park (co-mentor), and a team of expert
advisors. The training plan for this career development award leverages mentorship from a team of
internationally recognized leaders in patient-oriented tobacco, e-cigarette, and OUD research, as well as
rigorous coursework taught by renowned Harvard faculty. I will acquire both the skillset and the feasibility data
needed to support a fully powered R01 proposal to conduct a RCT testing a smoking intervention to reduce the

launch me towards my long-term goal of a career as an independent investigator conducting high impact

10774216,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The main neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the extracellular accumulation of amyloid
plaque deposits and intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). To enable the study of disease
progression and the effect of therapeutics in preclinical mouse models of AD, there is an urgent need for non-
invasive methods of imaging both hallmarks in the living brain. The most established non-invasive imaging
approaches at the whole animal level are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography
(PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, only optical techniques like near-
infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging have the theoretical spatial resolution to image individual amyloid plaques
and NFTs. In contrast to PET and SPECT, NIR fluorescence has the additional advantage of using safe, non-
ionizing radiation. Previous NIR fluorescence probes for AD have mostly emitted in the 600-650 nm wavelength
range. While these probes can be used to provide low resolution, bulk estimates of AD pathology burden in vivo
and to distinguish between AD mice and wildtype controls, they lack the ability to provide absolute quantitation
and cannot be used to image non-invasively with microscopic resolution. To enable non-invasive optical imaging
through the intact scalp and intact skull of mice, the wavelength of the fluorescent probe needs to be shifted into
the NIR-II spectrum (1,000-1,700 nm). At these longer wavelengths, the penetration depth through tissue is
increased dramatically while the background caused by intrinsic autofluorescence is minimized. Here we
propose to develop and identify candidate probes for NIR-II imaging by employing two complimentary strategies.
In the first approach, we will modify the chemical structure of a promising candidate probe, with existing affinity
for amyloid plaques and NFTs to enhance its binding affinity and NIR-II fluorescence emission. In the second
approach, we will screen an existing chemical library of > 650 NIR fluorophores using chemical structure-activity
modeling and in vitro and in vivo characterization. To image our candidate NIR-II fluorophores in vivo, we will
build a custom multi-modal microscope combining NIR confocal and multiphoton microscopy and fully
characterize its performance with simulations and experimental validation. We will conduct longitudinal, in vivo
imaging studies in AD mice to validate our developed probes and instrumentation and demonstrate for the first
time non-invasive monitoring of AD pathology with microscopic resolution. The excellent scientific environment
and world-class resources provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, as
well as the internationally recognized leadership of the applicant's mentors, along with the expertise of the
proposed collaborators, will be key to the successful completion of the proposed research. This K01 award will
be instrumental for the applicant to strengthen his skillset with training in optical probe development and in vivo
imaging in AD mice and to take the next steps towards becoming an independent researcher."

Delirium is frequently precipitated by urinary tract infection (UTI), a condition that
disproportionately affects older women and contributes to increased mortality, prolonged length
of stay, and accelerated long-term cognitive decline. Existing treatments for delirium center
largely on treatment of the precipitating cause, modification of environmental contributors, and
avoidance of deliriogenic medications; however, do not address the underlying pathobiology of
the condition.
We have developed a novel mouse model of UTI-induced delirium and generated compelling
preliminary data that demonstrate a potential role for exogenously administered 17β-estradiol in
mitigating UTI-induced delirium. These findings may explain, at least in part, why older women,
who after menopause have reduced levels of 17β-estradiol, are particularly susceptible to
developing delirium.
In this R21 application, we propose to use our novel mouse model of urinary tract infection-
induced delirium, oophorectomized mice, state-of-the-art behavioral testing, and genetically
modified mice to determine whether 17β-estradiol ameliorates the structural and functional
phenotypes of delirium via the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1. Given the lack of
evidence-based pharmacological treatments for delirium, the findings from this research could
have widespread clinical implications, including providing novel pre-clinical justification for
clinical trials using a short-term application of an existing drug, 17β-estradiol, to ameliorate UTI-
induced delirium and quality of life for millions of older women around the world."

PAR-21-174
Summary/Abstract
 The Nebraska Department of Agriculture Produce Safety Program (NDA PSP) will be
 pursuing Path B for this grant application to build upon the established produce safety
 program in Nebraska. This is the path that the program is currently on and plans to
 remain so. There are no plans to implement the PSR into Nebraska state law; the NDA
 PSP will continue to operate under FDA authority. The NDA PSP plans to conduct
 Sprout Inspections under Subpart M beginning in Year 3. No NDA PSP staff has yet to
 be trained but there are plans to change that.
 The Program Objectives are:
 1. Expand NDA Produce Safety Program built during the initial 5-year grant
 2. Provide Outreach and Education to Nebraska growers
 3. Develop, train, and maintain NDA PSP staff
 4. Attend consortiums, conferences, and webinars annually as a team
 5. Utilize electronic inspection software for inspections
 6. Maintain, update, and build the electronic inventory program
 7. Inspect high priority covered farms every 3 years and low priority covered farms
 every 5 years.
 8. Offer and provide On Farm Readiness Reviews prior to all inspections
Expected Outcomes: The program will continue their work to maintain and expand upon
the electronic inventory, perform inspections of covered farms every 3-5 years based on
priority, and will offer OFRRs annually. The program will capture regulatory inspection
information utilizing electronic inspection software developed during the original five-
year grant.
NDA’s PSP will continue to act as a helpful resource to growers who are navigating the
PSR through workshops, OFRRs, PSA trainings, and a variety of other outreach
activities aimed at meeting the needs of Nebraska growers.
Program staff will remain fully trained and attend relevant events supporting
professional growth and development within the program. Along with experience and
FDA’s guidance, training and events will positively impact the team’s ability to maintain
effective relationships with growers through outreach, education, and inspection."

Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Inflammation is an essential component of colon cancer initiation and progression. Most notable examples for such inflammatory conditions and subsequent tumors include colitis-associated colon cancer, where chronic pre-existing inflammation increases the risk of cancer. However, even sporadic colon cancers that are not linked to pre-existing inflammatory disease, inflammation can impact growth and progression. Our works also has carefully demonstrated that the recruitment of neutrophils is a critical mechanism by which HIF2α promotes colon cancer growth. We recently have found that gut microbiota metabolites are essential regulators of HIF2α expression and activity. However, it is unclear the role of the microbial metabolites in HIF2α regulation in colon cancer, does hypoxia have a cell autonomous role in the regulation of neutrophils, and can HIF2α be targeted in colon cancer? This research area is underexplored and has the potential to generate novel therapies and therapeutic targeted in colon cancer. The overall objective of this research proposal is to define the mechanistic underpinnings by which HIF2α via cooperative metabolite crosstalk potentiate colon cancer progression. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that HIF2α activation in epithelial cells and neutrophils promote an immunosuppressive environment is critical in intestinal regeneration following injury and colon cancer progression. Our recent work identified that gut microbiota metabolites as essentially regulators of HIF2α and Aim 1 will delineate if microbial metabolite axis is the major mechanism regulating HIF2α in inflammation and colon cancer. Using a novel reporter mouse, we identified that neutrophils express high levels of HIF2α and Aim 2 will understand if cell autonomous HIF2α regulation in neutrophils is critical for immunosuppressive metabolite production in inflammation and colon cancer. The first on-target HIF2α inhibitor is undergoing clinical trials for renal cancers and has demonstrated promising results. In Aim 3 we will determine if this inhibitor provides any benefit alone or in an adjuvant setting with immune checkpoint blockers in preclinical models of colon cancer. Accomplishing these Aims will (i) uncover mechanisms of HIF2α regulation (ii) define new metabolic pathways that alter neutrophil function, and (iii) highlight new pathways, genetic vulnerabilities and drug targets for colon cancer."

10914050,"Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and disabling side effect of chemotherapy.
It frequently leads to chemotherapy dose alteration, pain, fall risk, and increased health care costs. Symptoms
are under reported, under treated and treatment often deviates from guidelines despite the opiate crisis. There
is an urgent need for implementation of effective evidence and consensus driven CIPN management.
Studies pairing a chemotherapy related symptom reporting tool with nurse follow up improved 6 month health
related quality of life and cancer survival. During chemotherapy, our studies pairing a CIPN symptom reporting
tool with nurse practitioner (NP) call back resulted in a 75% reduction in CIPN symptoms. (This care model is
called Symptom Care at Home with NP follow up, SCH-NP). The efficacy of this system post chemotherapy
when CIPN symptoms are worst and doctors visits are infrequent remains unexplored. The proposed RCT will
examine SCH-NP treatment during the period of maximal symptoms, utilize a standardized guideline
based care protocol, allow for phone, app and web based symptom reporting and determine efficacy
using neuropathy specific outcomes. The overall goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a new
care model that facilitates symptom reporting and proactive treatment management to reduce CIPN symptoms.
Specific Aim1: Determine the efficacy of SCH-NP vs. usual care (UC) to reduce post chemotherapy CIPN
symptoms over 12 weeks. We hypothesize SCH-NP will reduce CIPN symptoms measured on the Neuropathy
Total Symptom Score 6 (NTSS6). 358 recently diagnosed CIPN patients will be randomized to 12 weeks of UC
or SCH-NP care. Both groups will report symptoms daily via phone, app or website. The UC group will receive
standard care through their treating physicians. In the SCH-NP group reporting moderate to severe symptoms
will trigger NP call back to provide evidence-based protocolized treatment including medications, self-care
strategies and referrals. Repeated measure analysis of the NTSS6 covariance will be used to compare groups.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of SCH-NP vs. UC in improving CIPN specific quality of life and
disability. We hypothesize that compared to UC, SCH-NP care will improve CIPN specific quality of life
(EORTC CIPN 20) and reduce disability (CIPN-RODS) measured by repeated covariance analysis.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of SCH-NP vs. UC on opiate usage and the utilization of available CIPN
therapies. We hypothesize SCH-NP care will reduced opiate use measured by % of subjects on ≥ 50 MME/
day (high risk) and improve CIPN therapy utilization including neuropathic pain med use, time to prescription,
selection of the correct therapy, adequate titration, max drug doses, and total number of CIPN treatments.
This innovative study utilizes a novel technology based model to circumnavigate roadblocks in CIPN care. The
study’s broad impact and substantial significance derive from the model’s ability to deliver care to those in
resource poor areas with reduced healthcare access in their time of greatest need."

Mounting evidence links the gut microbiome – the modifiable “second genome” consisting of trillions
of diverse microbes that inhabit the human gut – with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans.
Studies using fecal transplant in mice have raised the central hypothesis that changes of the gut
microbiome and the biochemical by-products originated from these microbes may be key modulators
of development of T2DM. To date, however, knowledge of the specific microbial species that drive the
development of T2DM in humans remain very limited. Human studies of the gut microbiome in T2DM
have largely been cross-sectional and confounded by reverse causality. Indeed, many of the gut
microbiome changes observed in human T2DM have been found to be a consequence of the disease
or treatments, including the medication metformin, rather than a cause of T2DM. In addition, the
circulating metabolites derived from the gut microbes that contribute to the development of T2DM
remain to be discovered. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest
prospective study of the role of gut microbiome in T2DM using a Finnish cohort of 6921 individuals
with fecal and plasma samples collected in 2002 and over 15 years of subsequent clinical follow up.
This proposed study brings together a diverse team with deep expertise in the human microbiome,
mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, computational biology, statistical epidemiology, and
diabetes pathobiology, to specifically address the key biological and clinical questions regarding the
role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of incident T2DM in
humans."

The Mechanisms of New-Onset Autoimmunity-Longitudinal Immune Systems Analysis (MONA-LISA) will use
clinical data and biospecimens obtained during performance of the clinical trial, Study of Anti-Malarials in
Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus (SMILE, NCT03030118) to investigate immunological mechanisms that
propel individuals who have asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic autoimmunity towards a definite diagnosis
of systemic lupus erythematosus. These data and specimens are a unique resource, representing longitudinal
clinical assessments, patient-reported outcomes, DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and urine obtained in a standardized manner before, during, and after the progression from Incomplete
Lupus Erythematosus to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) – an observation that occurred in twenty
percent of the SMILE participants available for study. The overall objective of the study is to learn the
underlying immunological, genomic, and metabolic differences present in individuals who progress to SLE
compared to those that do not progress with goals to both develop better diagnostic and prognostic tools for
health care providers as well as describe novel therapeutic targets so that individuals with early features of
autoimmunity can be prevented from progressing to a state of organ damage and disability.
The Specific Aims of MONA-LISA include: 1) Obtain a comprehensive, multiplex analysis of the peripheral
blood immunophenotype of progressors and non-progressors in the SMILE cohort using a novel 137-plex
CITE-seq analysis, sn-ATAC-seq, sc-RNA-seq and T and B cell repertoire determination to create a robust,
quantitative atlas of cell-specific mRNA and epigenomic profiling in PBMC of these individuals. 2) Perform
targeted genomic sequencing to categorize regulatory and structural variants of SLE risk loci to tie together the
transcriptomic and epigenomic data and create novel risk assessments based on gene regulation. 3) Explore
plasma and serum metabolic and lipid components that can serve as novel features that classify the risk of
SMILE participants who progress towards classification with lupus. 4) Lastly, because SMILE enrolled fewer
Black individuals than are represented in the epidemiology of prevalent lupus patients, we will perform a
focused recruitment of non-European individuals with ILE and compare their multi-omic characterization of
immunophenotypes described in Aims 1-3. This will allow more complete and generalizable conclusions to be
drawn across ethnic groups and identify any ancestry-specific variations in the risk of autoimmunity
progression that can explain the observed differences in lupus epidemiology. When completed, MONA-LISA
will provide researchers and health care providers with better tools to predict who will develop lupus and create
more effective interventional trials for disease prevention."

The high mortality rate associated with ovarian cancer results from the failure of tumor-directed therapy to
produce lasting treatment responses. Durable survival in patients with other solid tumors has recently been
achieved using immune checkpoint antibodies, however similar results have not been observed in women
with ovarian cancer. Published work from our lab demonstrates that combining poly(adenosine
diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) with immune checkpoint blockade can achieve
long-term survival in ovarian cancer models. The scientific premise for this study is based accumulating
evidence of a dynamic interaction between PARPi and the tumor microenvironment (TME) that regulates
treatment response and disease outcomes. Work to date has identified a tumor-intrinsic mechanism by
which PARPi interact with interferon gamma (IFNg) to promote immunogenic cell death in ovarian cancer
cells. This results in activation of tumor immunity in vivo, associated with the successful induction of
protective immune memory. Evidence that conditions in the tumor environment significantly modulate the
therapeutic efficacy of PARP-inhibitors, termed “contextual synthetic lethality”, presents an opportunity to
maximize patient outcomes and target treatment effects to the TME. Here we propose to examine the
contribution of PARP trapping by different PARPi on these tumor-intrinsic mechanisms to determine
whether we can induce similar results in BRCAwt cancers. We will additionally expand studies of tumor-
extrinsic immune modulation by PARPi in the TME to test whether macrophage polarization can engage
secondary mechanisms of CTLA4ab to enhance treatment outcomes. Finally we will validate candidate
biomarkers of response in patients enrolled in two clinical trials, and will examine associations with immune
profiling in collaboration with the Cancer Immune Monitoring Analysis Centers. With the rapid adoption of
immune checkpoint antibodies and PARP-inhibitors for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other tumor
types, this proposal has potential for immediate clinical impact through current and planned clinical trials."

 Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a global cause of pediatric gastroenteritis, and can cause disseminated
infection in immunocompromised hosts. Seroprevalence studies indicate almost universal HAstV infection during
childhood. Despite their clinical importance, HAstVs are highly understudied in part due to the lack of a well-
defined small animal model. Murine astrovirus (muAstV), which shares numerous genomic and phenotypic
features with HAstVs, causes chronic infection in immunodeficient models and has begun to provide important
insights into innate and adaptive immune regulation of AstV pathogenesis in vivo. Preliminary data indicates that
CD8+ T cells are critical for clearance of chronic muAstV. However, to date functional and phenotypic features
of the CD8+ T cell response remain uncharacterized for both HAstV and muAstV. Further, the specific viral
epitopes targeted by CD8+ T cells remain to be delineated for both HAstV and muAstV.
 The definition of immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes will facilitate characterization of AstV-specific T
cell functions in vivo and reveal key viral epitopes to target for future vaccines and cellular therapies. Overlapping
peptide libraries will be used for ex vivo screening of immunodominant muAstV CD8+ T cell epitopes by well-
established protocols, with the goal of developing MHC class I peptide tetramers to track muAstV-specific CD8+
T cells. Two phenotypically-distinct muAstV strains, with one causing acute self-limited infection and the other
causing chronic infection in immunocompetent mice, will be leveraged to define effector and memory muAstV-
specific CD8+ T cell phenotypes and functionality across multiple tissues. These studies, to be conducted in
established in vivo mouse models, will reveal whether functionally suboptimal CD8+ T cell responses contribute
to impaired clearance of some viral strains. Finally, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from donors
carrying an MHC class I allele associated with protection from HAstV will be used to identify immunodominant
HAstV CD8+ T cell epitopes, permitting development of tetramers to characterize HAstV-specific CD8+ T cell
phenotypes across a variety of donors with this common allele.
 These studies are highly appropriate for the R21 grant mechanism, as they involve development of critical
tools for immunological studies using methods that have not yet been applied towards AstVs. Completion of this
proposal will both provide key insights into the cellular immune response against AstVs and develop tetramer
reagents to be used for future definition of T cell responses following natural infection and vaccination. Further,
immunodominant epitopes identified will represent important targets for vaccines and cellular therapies against
these clinically important enteric viral pathogens."
10766271,"The pathogenic bacteria Legionella pneumophila (Lp), the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease,
injects nearly 330 effectors using its Dot/Icm protein secretion system into host cytosol to remodel cellular
processes toward creating and maintaining a replicative organelle called the legionella-containing
vacuole (LCV). Research in the last few years has shown some remarkable examples of ubiquitination
chemistry catalyzed by some of these effectors that are unparalleled in the eukaryotic world. Two notable
examples of ubiquitination of host targets have been identified where the mechanisms are independent
of and radically different from the eukaryotic E1-E2-E3 system. This has added an exciting new layer of
complexity to ubiquitin (Ub) manipulation by Lp, which was already known to possess several classical
Ub E3 ligases and deubiquitinases among its effectors. This raises a question as to how far and deep
Legionella’s manipulation of the host ubiquitin goes. Are there additional new Ub-manipulating
proteins/enzymes in the large effector arsenal of the bacteria?
 We have performed an activity-based enrichment analysis to identify novel Ub-interacting proteins
among Lp effectors to address this question. We have used Ub-derived activity-based probes (Ub-ABPs)
to enrich proteins from the soluble proteome of Lp and have identified candidates using liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This has led us to the Dot/Icm
substrate MavL, with unknown biochemical and biological function, as a novel Ub-interacting effector. On
further analysis, we find that MavL is a deADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase capable of removing ADP-ribose
(ADPR) from an arginine side chain of ADP-ribosylated Ub (ADPR-Ub). We will use a proximity labeling
biotinylation strategy implemented under infection conditions to capture MavL substrates. To complement
this strategy, we will engineer an inactive mutant of the enzyme into an affinity tool for proteome-wide
enrichment and identification of MavL interactors from host cells. Combining information from the
proteomics datasets, we aim to arrive at a list of candidates which will be validated in cell-based assays
under infection conditions. Further, we will try to provide the structural basis of Ub recognition by this
novel pathogenic effector. Taken together, we will be able to characterize a unique Ub-recognizing
deADP-ribosylating enzyme from a pathogenic bacterium and explore its host targets, thereby expanding
the scope of reversible ADP-ribosylation in host-pathogen interaction."

Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder in the United States and is particularly common
among adolescents. Social anxiety is linked to a host of maladaptive developmental outcomes for youth,
including loneliness, other anxiety disorders, and depression, and youth with social anxiety often do not access
mental health services. One area of high clinical and practical value is identifying innovative ways to support
adaptive coping strategies that will help adolescents manage social anxiety. Dog companionship has the
potential to be an effective strategy for supporting youth with anxiety by promoting behavioral and cognitive
strategies that are associated with adaptive coping. However, the existing body of evidence regarding pets and
mental health suggests that pet ownership is neither universally beneficial in all circumstances, nor applicable
to all youth due to the unique and variable nature of dog-youth relationships. Currently, there are significant
gaps in the existing evidence regarding specificity in how, for which individuals, experiencing what
circumstances, via what processes dog relationships can promote adaptive coping for adolescents. These
gaps in nuanced data limit current translational impact and the ability to design and scale interventions. Our
overall objective is to harness the potential of dog-youth interaction by identifying the specific ways that these
relationships can be optimized to support adaptive coping for adolescents experiencing social anxiety. To
address this objective, we will use a multi-method, integrated approach to determine: (Aim 1) longitudinal inter-
individual differences in trajectories of associations between dog-adolescent relationships and adaptive coping
with social anxiety, (Aim 2) family-level processes involved in adolescent-dog relationships that support
adaptive coping with social anxiety over time, and (Aim 3) how the momentary effects of interactions with a pet
dog influence continuously collected peripheral physiology as an indicator of anxious arousal. The long-term
goal of this research is to decrease the mental health burden of social anxiety during a crucial period of
adolescent social development via dog companionship. By identifying both the processes and mechanisms
involved in dog interaction and adaptive coping, we will advance practitioners’ ability to maximize adaptive
coping strategies supported by dog interactions during a crucial period of adolescent social development. The
results will further enable evidence-based recommendations for successfully leveraging dog relationships to
inform future research on clinical interventions involving dogs."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection leads to 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000 hospitalizations for
children under 5 years of age. In those 65 years of age or older, RSV accounts for an average of 177,000
hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths annually, with similar mortality rates to influenza. Human data suggest pre-
existing atopy may have a protective effect on mortality and severity of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
mouse models have shown protection from influenza mediated mortality with pre-existing atopy; however, the
mechanism of this protection remains unclear. Using the house dust mite model of atopy, we found being atopic
before infection with mouse parainfluenza virus type-1 (Sendai virus; SeV, a murine virus closely related to RSV),
prevented mortality to an otherwise lethal viral dose. This survival depended upon CD11c+ cells, which produced
neureglin-1 (NRG1). NRG1 appears to protect airway epithelium from the viral insult. Two alarmins released in
the house dust mite model, IL33 and TSLP, induced NRG1 production from CD11c+ cells. CD11c+ cells from
atopic mice or exogenous NRG1 reduced viral replication in airway epithelial cells in vitro and NRG1 significantly
reduced mortality in vivo. Based on our data, we propose the hypothesis that pre-existing atopy protects against
respiratory viral induced mortality in an IL33-TSLP dependent process that drives CD11c+ cells to produce
NRG1, which restores epithelial cell homeostasis and protects epithelial cells from viral infection. Using our
mouse model and mouse and human airway epithelial cell cultures to test these hypotheses, we propose to: (I)
Define the NRG1 producing cell(s) in atopic mice and determine the requirement for NRG1 in atopy mediated
survival from normally lethal SeV infection. (II) Determine the effect of NRG1 on epithelial cell function and
protection from a respiratory viral insult. Upon completion of this proposal, we will have identified and
characterized the NRG1 producing cells in the atopic mouse lung, the requirement for these cells and NRG1 in
mediating survival in SeV infected atopic mice, and the requirement for alarmins in the development of the NRG1
producing cells and subsequent survival from the viral infection. In addition, we will have mechanistically
characterized the effect of NRG1 on epithelial cells and determined the potential for NRG1 as a therapeutic
agent. These findings form the basis for future studies to explore therapeutic interventions to prevent mortality
from respiratory viral infections, with great potential to change medical care for severe respiratory viral infections."

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is among the most commonly altered tumor suppressor genes in
human cancers. The overarching premise of this project is twofold. First, while PTEN function can be
compromised by genetic mutations in inherited syndromes and sporadic cancers, post-translational
modifications (PTMs) of PTEN may play key roles in the dynamic regulation of PTEN function. Prior studies on
PTEN PTMs, including our work supported by this award, identified that deregulated ubiquitination and
deubiquitination lead to detrimental effects on PTEN stability and subcellular localization, thereby causing
tumorigenesis. Secondly, PTEN fulfils many of its tumor suppressive roles through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway; however, the role of PTEN has also been shown to extend beyond the control of PI3K, with PTEN
implicated in controlling genomic stability and cell cycle progression, although the mechanism remains unclear.
The overall goal of this application is to investigate the mechanisms of nuclear PTEN-mediated tumor
suppression, focusing on cancer-specific PTM regulation of PTEN compartmentalization and non-canonical
functions independent of its cytoplasmic phosphatase activity. Our new preliminary study revealed the novel
upstream PTM mechanism and essential downstream effectors for nuclear PTEN in cancer. Multi-omics
analyses of proteome, transcriptome and epigenome revealed a clear link between the PTEN-chromatin
remodeling factor axis and genomic integrity within the nucleus. Further, this novel PTEN-associated chromatin
remodeling factor conferred synthetic essentiality in cancer cells lacking nuclear PTEN. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that canonical and non-canonical PTEN signaling coordinately reduces
tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) determine how PTEN PTMs occur
and their role in cancer; (2) define the non-canonical roles of PTEN in tumorigenesis and genomic instability;
(3) explore the therapeutic potential of the PTEN-chromatin remodeling factor axis in cancer. The completion of
this project will not only gain insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the newly
characterized PTM of PTEN tipping the balance between its canonical and non-canonical signaling, but also
yield critical information about the development of effective strategies for precision treatment of PTEN loss-of-
function driven cancers."

The burden of stroke remains unacceptably high and few treatments are proven to improve stroke prevention
or recovery. An estimated 70% to 90% of stroke survivors have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Compared to
those without OSA, stroke patients with OSA have worse functional outcomes after inpatient rehabilitation
(IPR), 40% longer IPR stays, a 100% increase in the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events, particularly
recurrent stroke, and a 75% increase in the risk of early death. Observational data suggest that treatment with
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the first-line treatment for OSA, holds promise to improve stroke
outcomes, including both preventing recurrence and improving recovery. However, poor CPAP adherence has
compromised pilot trials of stroke survivors with OSA, yielding mixed results and limiting the ability to test
CPAP efficacy. Individualized behavioral interventions to improve CPAP adherence have shown benefit in the
general population, though little is known about their effectiveness to optimize CPAP among stroke patients,
who are likely to respond to behavioral interventions differently. We propose to adapt and refine for stroke
patients a multicomponent behavioral intervention to improve CPAP adherence with the engagement and input
of stroke survivors. Then, within a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we will test the efficacy of the
intervention, initiated during inpatient rehabilitation, on CPAP use among stroke patients over the course of 3
months. The adherence intervention will include: 1) CPAP technical support, 2) motivational enhancement
therapy, and 3) self-monitoring using mobile health technologies with automated support. If successful, the
study will provide researchers a much-needed intervention to realize the full benefits of CPAP after stroke. It is
difficult to imagine a non-invasive, relatively low-cost intervention with a similar potential as CPAP for such a
common and disabling a disease as stroke."

This purpose of this project is to use a combination of Markov models, stated preference data and econometric
models of treatment take-up to calculate the costs, benefits, societal value and health equity impacts of novel
treatments or Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). In this project, we
will study the health equity implications of the cost effectiveness models new novel treatments for AD/ADRD
using a combination of Markov models, data from the literature and clinical trials, community based
participatory research (CBPR) with focus groups and experimental preference data. First, we will update our
existing cost effectiveness Markov model (developed for aducanumab and donanemab for early Alzheimer
disease in the United States) in incorporate race specific inputs into the start values and transition probabilities.
Next, we will engage in CBPR by conducting focus groups on AD/ADRD with at-risk African-American/Black
individuals in a poor, underserved area (Richmond, VA). In this, we will leverage pre-existing relationships to
engage with community partners working on healthy aging. We will also conduct focus groups with caregivers
to understand the effect of caregiver burden. We will use the results of the models to measure the economic
value of reducing AD/ADRD in different populations using experimental stated preference data from Discrete
Choice Experiments. Finally, we will estimate models of treatment take-up using a combination of latent
choice and mixed logit models to control for both observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity both
between different racial groups and within racial groups. We will calibrate our models using nationally
representative Medicare data to simulate take-up rates, and subsequent costs and benefits to new treatments
plus the impact of health equity. Finally, we will develop simulation models based on the take-up rates to
identify policy changes that could be used to ensure that new treatment improve health equity."

Healthy nutrition habits are key to managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, American Indian and Alaska
Natives (AI/ANs) often lack access to healthy food and disproportionately experience food insecurity. Food
insecurity, defined as lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life, negatively impacts
one’s ability to manage blood sugar and body weight. I am pursuing a K01 Mentored Research Scientist
Development Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of quantitative data analysis of intervention studies
and effectiveness and pragmatic study design. In order to effectively bridge my prior training and research
experience to obtain my first R01, I have carefully developed a mentored training plan that strategically supports
my research aims for this K01 award. I am currently Co-Investigator on a study team that developed a culturally
responsive diabetes nutrition education curriculum for AI/AN adults with T2D, entitled “What Can I Eat? Healthy
Choices for AI/ANs with T2D” (WCIE). WCIE includes interactive, hands-on nutrition education learning activities,
including portion control, decreasing sugary beverages and saturated fat, and problem solving for barriers to
healthful eating. In January 2020 we launched a tribally-supported, 6-site, waitlist control design test of WCIE.
In June 2021, we will complete data collection with 150 AI/AN adults who have T2D. Data will include 3 timepoints
for immediate intervention and 5 for waitlist intervention participants over 6 months with surveys (nutrition
knowledge, behavior, self-efficacy) and clinical outcomes (BMI, blood pressure, and HbA1c). Though WCIE does
not include a specific food insecurity intervention, we included a household food insecurity measure at all data
collection timepoints. In Aim #1 of this proposed K01 I will examine the relationship between food insecurity and
clinical WCIE outcomes in the existing dataset through secondary analysis to utilize my new intervention
quantitative data analysis skills and advance understanding of the moderating effect of food insecurity on
diabetes nutrition education and T2D outcomes among AI/ANs. In Aim #2 I will design/pilot test WCIE with added
service to improve healthy food access and evaluate its feasibility/impact on T2D outcomes at an urban AI/AN-
serving clinic in Oklahoma City, OK. We will work with the Oklahoma City clinic to identify their need for a healthy
food access service in the following domains: transportation, availability of healthy food, or affordability of healthy
food. Aim #2 will provide me the opportunity to utilize my new training in effectiveness and pragmatic trials study
design and quantitative data analysis of intervention studies. My detailed training plan includes formal
coursework at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, seminars, workshops/conferences on
AI/AN health research, and support from my mentors who are experts and leaders in the area of AI/AN diabetes
health, AI/AN health interventions, T2D and food insecurity interventions, and quantitative/study design
methodology. The proposed training plan and aims will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to
successfully obtain R01 funding and become a leader in diabetes health disparities intervention science."

 Germline mutation in the tumor suppressor gene BAP1 is associated with the hereditary tumor
predisposition syndrome, BAP1-TPDS (OMIM 614327), that we and others identified in 2011. The syndrome is
associated with predisposition to mainly four cancers: uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma,
and renal cell carcinoma in addition to a preneoplastic melanocytic skin lesions (BAP1-Inactivated Melanocytic
Tumors). Other cancers have been also reported in patients with germline BAP1 mutation but it is not clear
whether they are part of the BAP1-TPDS. Since its characterization, more than 200 distinct families have been
reported with an increasing number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants being deposited in ClinVar. Our our
analysis of variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database suggests that BAP1-TPDS is
underreported in cancer patients.
 BAP1 is a deubiquitinating hydrolase that has four known functions: (i) cell cycle regulation and cell
growth, (ii) DNA damage repair, (iii) chromatin remodelling and regulation of gene expression, and (iv) regulation
of apoptosis. Which of these complex functional roles are responsible for its tumor suppressor function is
unknown, and needs to be determined to enable identification of the best experimental model system(s) to predict
the clinical significance of the variants of uncertain significance. Our goal is to characterize the clinical
phenotypes associated with different germline variants of BAP1 in order to dissect its complex functions. We will
address the following critical barriers: 1) the limited number of reported germline variants in BAP1 with known
clinical phenotype; 2) the need for experimental model system(s) to assess the clinical impact of different coding
variants in BAP1; and 3) the need to assess the contribution of non-coding variants in germline inactivation of
BAP1.
Specific Aim1: To expand the understanding of the clinical phenotypes of BAP1-TPDS and correlate with variants
in the gene.
Specific Aim2: Establish experimental model systems for evaluation of BAP1 germline missense variants of
uncertain significance.
Specific Aim3: To assess the contribution of non-coding variants in germline inactivation of BAP1.
Scientific and Translational Impact: The outcomes of these studies have the potential to provide clinicians with
crucial resources needed to address a major barrier for proper counseling and management of patients and
families with germline mutations in BAP1. The results will also provide basic scientists with important resources
for further studies of various tumor suppressor functions of BAP1, as well as crucial resources for the NCI
ClinGen and ClinVar projects."

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most common drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia and can
lead to catastrophic thrombosis in an affected patient. Antibodies that recognize the platelet alpha-granule
protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4), in a complex with heparin are central to HIT pathogenesis. Human B cells have
extensive heterogeneity. Innate-like B cells, such as B1 and marginal zone (MZ) B cells, later germinal center
(GC) B cells, different types of memory B cells, and extrafollicular plasmablasts all play an importance and unique
role in the development of humoral immunity. Rapid onset of HIT antibody production and apparent lack of
immunologic memory suggest T-cell independence whereas IgG antibodies typical of HIT argue for T cell
involvement. The profound heterogeneity of human B cells and the ambiguous features of the HIT antibody
response have confounded efforts to identify the pathogenic B cells and characterize the atypical immune
response in HIT patients. In a mouse model, we have demonstrated that MZ B cells play a critical role in HIT
antibody production. In the immediate past grant period, we discovered that in mice, breakdown of immunologic
tolerance was involved in HIT antibody production and T helper cells and regulatory T cells could mediate the
production of PF4/heparin-specific HIT antibodies. We also identified several novel pathways controlling B cell
tolerance that was critical for controlling production of autoantibodies. Importantly, from HIT human patients, we
cloned PF4/heparin-specific and platelet-activating antibodies possessing a unique RKH- or Y5-motif in the
heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) region that contributes the most to affinity and
specificity of antigen binding. We found that a higher percentage of PF4/heparin-specific B cells, compared to
the control B cells, exhibited extrafollicular B-cell features and an atypical memory B cell (atyMB) phenotype.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PF4/heparin-specific B cells undergo extrafollicular response to
follow a distinct differentiation path from activated naïve B cells first into atyMBs and then into plasmablasts in
HIT patients. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) study the characteristics of PF4/heparin-specific B cells in HIT
patients through integrative analysis of phenotypical, transcriptional and epigenetic responses of these B cells
and (2) investigate the origin and developmental trajectory of PF4/heparin-specific B cells that produce platelet-
activating antibodies in HIT patients. The proposed studies will identify the key features of PF4/heparin-specific
B cells and their correlation with disease progression and severity and will discover the evolution of PF4/heparin-
specific B-cell response. Completion of the proposed studies will provide novel insights into the molecular
pathogenesis of HIT and guide future diagnosis, prevention and treatment of this potentially devastating disease."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent affecting 14% of the U.S. population leading to
substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. Older adults with CKD identify maintenance of functional
independence as their top priority. Skeletal muscle health is critical for mobility and an underrecognized target
of metabolic acidosis (MA) and protein energy wasting in CKD. Skeletal muscle endurance provides a window
into muscle metabolic health and muscle quality. Muscle mitochondrial metabolism is central to muscle and
walking endurance providing energy from carbohydrates and fats to power repeated muscle contraction. We
showed metabolic acidosis and muscle adiposity as the major determinants of muscle mitochondrial function.
 Metabolic acidosis (MA) is long believed to be the main mechanism leading to skeletal muscle wasting
and peripheral insulin resistance in CKD. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism is considered a principal
determinant of peripheral insulin sensitivity and muscle quality, but little is known of the impact of MA on
muscle mitochondrial function. Muscle mitochondrial dysfunction leads to defective lipid metabolism
augmenting adiposity and lipotoxic intermediates resulting in insulin resistance, low endurance, and muscle
atrophy. Using in vivo 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) we showed that the
presence and severity of CKD is strongly associated with impaired muscle mitochondrial capacity to generate
ATP translating into poor walking endurance. We also showed MA and muscle adiposity are the major
determinants of muscle mitochondrial function. Recently a non-sodium polymer (veverimer) selectively binding
hydrogen chloride in gastrointestinal tract safely improved serum bicarbonate and meaningfully improved
physical functioning in a randomized clinical trial. Despite the importance of mitochondrial function to muscle
health, it is unknown if treatment of MA benefits muscle mitochondrial function, adiposity or endurance in CKD.
 The proposed project will use precise, in vivo 31P MRS and gold-standard testing of peripheral insulin
sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to probe the pathophysiology of MA and low endurance in a
clinical trial of alkali therapy in CKD and MA. We will compare veverimer or low-dose sodium bicarbonate to
placebo in a multicenter randomized, double-dummy placebo-controlled, cross-over trial design in 102 persons
with moderate-severe CKD and MA. First, we will test the efficacy of 3-months of alkali therapy comparing
veverimer or low dose sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on muscle metabolic health in a randomized
crossover trial in MA. Second, Test the efficacy of 3-months of alkali therapy comparing veverimer or low dose
sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on improving physical endurance in MA. Our rationale is that identification
of therapeutic targets for low physical endurance will inform the development of pharmacologic interventions.
Long term, we expect strategies treating MA will improve exercise tolerance enabling effective engagement in
lifestyle interventions improving quality of life in CKD."

 Studies have demonstrated that adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) repair
myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by indirect paracrine mechanisms rather than by
differentiation and tissue replacement. In the past decade, exosomes have emerged as promising cell-free
agents for treating ischemic injury. Several exosome-based therapeutic companies have launched early phase
clinical trials. Like most therapeutics, there is an urgent need for effective delivery strategy to ensure a
sufficient number of exosomes to reach the injured tissue. Since they are nanosized natural lipid bilayer
particles, one option is vascular delivery. However, high and repeated dosing is needed due to a large degree
of off-target distribution to the mononuclear phagocyte system and other organs, such as the liver, spleen and
lungs. Moreover, MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-XOs) need to compete with naturally existing exosomes in
body fluids. Cellular binding and uptake of MSC-XOs also hinder the therapeutic effects. Novel approaches are
required to deliver therapeutic exosomes to cells in injured tissues. Ideally, modified exosomes should 1)
reduce the clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system, 2) bind to injured blood vessels, and 3) be
efficiently uptake by target cell types in injured tissues. It has been established that acute MI can induce
vascular damage and expose components of the subendothelial matrix including collagen, fibronectin and von
Willebrand factor (vWF) to recruit platelets. Platelets can bind to and accumulate on injured vasculature
following MI. Instead of generically modifying the parental cells or chemically engineering exosomes, we used
platelet membranes to envelope exosomes (to make P-XOs) and increase their macropinocytosis-mediated
cellular internalization, and their ability to target the injured tissue. In this proposed study, we plan to
investigate the fabrication, characterization and toxicity of P-XOs (AIM 1). After that, we will test the therapeutic
effect of P-XOs on a mouse model (AIM 2) and a porcine model (AIM 3) with cardiac injury. Our study will
provide new insights on cellular internalization mechanism of exosomes, targeting properties and mechanism
of the P-XOs treatment. Together, the proposed mechanistic and translational experiments will provide a
scientific premise to understand system administrated exosomes while suggesting new approaches for
promoting targeting and therapeutic effect of therapeutic exosomes."
10892123,"Latinx adults experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease in the United States, driven in part
by structural barriers to accessing and utilizing care. Latinx patients are at risk for hypertension (HTN), and are
less likely to be able to access necessary care to manage this condition. Digital health tools such as remote
patient monitoring (RPM) have potential to improve the care of Latinx patients with HTN by enabling more
frequent and tailored monitoring of blood pressure, providing additional health information, empowering patients,
and enhancing care decision-making without disrupting patients’ daily lives. However, there are significant
disparities in the access and use of these digital tools, as well as challenges to equitable and sustainable
implementation. To mitigate these disparities, there is urgent need to identify methods to equip and facilitate the
implementation of RPM for diverse populations and address social, structural, and digital determinants of health
to make RPM care more appropriate for diverse patient needs. Community health workers (CHWs) are
specifically trained to address social and structural determinants of health to help patients manage health
conditions, provide culturally and contextually competent support, and navigate complex health systems; “tech-
enabled” CHWs have potential to be catalysts for improved RPM use for Latinx patients. Our team – comprised
of leaders of RPM implementation and infrastructure, CHW training, informatics, digital health, quantitative and
qualitative study design, data analytics, and health disparities research – seeks to determine if the addition of
RPM-enabled CHWs provided with specific training and EHR support tools can improve HTN control and reduce
inequities among Latinx patients with uncontrolled HTN. Specifically, we seek to: 1) develop adapted community
health worker remote patient monitoring training modules (“CHW RPM”) and electronic health record support
tools (“CHW RPM-EHR"") guided by the CFIR model to enhance the management of hypertension in Latinx
patients; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of RPM-enabled CHWs compared to standard of care RPM hypertension
management on blood pressure reduction among 300 Latinx patients with uncontrolled hypertension; and 3)
apply Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF) to evaluate the implementation of the RPM-enabled
CHWs for HTN management, and examine adoption, acceptability, fidelity, cost, sustainability, and equity as
mechanisms of implementation effectiveness. The primary outcome will be improvements in HTN management
at 12 months. We will utilize a mixed methods approach – including EHR-based data review, patient surveys, in-
depth interviews with PCPs, RNS, CHWs, and patients – novel consensus-building, user-centered design and
agile development techniques, and theory-driven implementation assessment frameworks to assess the
intervention. This research will help inform RPM implementation for our diverse patient population, as well as
offer larger insights into to the opportunities and challenges of using CHWs to expand access to RPM to Latinx
patients and ultimately improve health equity."

Sleep apnea (SA) and insomnia are the two most common sleep disorders, and both contribute individually and
jointly to the risk of cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases. Despite their high prevalence,
treatments for SA and insomnia remain suboptimal. SA and insomnia are thought to be comprised of distinct
subtypes, which remain poorly defined and may contribute to differing risks for health outcomes. Our goal is to
use machine learning to apply precise phenotyping to biobanks to identify the genetic bases of SA and
insomnia and discover SA and insomnia subtypes based on genetics and comorbidities in order to reduce
phenotype heterogeneity, guide patient stratification and aid in the discovery of more personalized treatments.
Our approach is to combine health care system biobank data with research polysomnography (PSG) to achieve
statistical power to discover genetic variants for SA and insomnia-related phenotypes and characterize their
associated clinical outcomes and endophenotypes (physiological mechanisms). We will use advanced natural
language processing (NLP) methods to substantially improve the accuracy of SA and insomnia phenotyping.
Our anticipated sample size will be >11-fold larger than prior genetic studies of SA, providing the necessary
statistical power for genetic discovery. Polygenic risk scores derived from our results can be used to quantify
sleep disorder risk, even among those without sleep phenotypes. Machine learning methods can identify
predictors of diagnosis-clustered patient groups contained within the medical record. Precision deeply-
phenotyped PSG data (eg hypoxic burden) can characterize endophenotypes at associated genetic loci using
genetic localization. We will derive advanced SA and insomnia phenotypes robust to demographic differences
across biobank sites, perform the largest genetic analysis of validated SA and insomnia phenotypes to date,
characterize novel loci, and study associations with clinical diagnosis data to improve patient classification in
three biobanks. We will explore sex-specific associations and validate lead genetic associations in two biobanks.
Our specific aims are: 1) to construct advanced SA and insomnia phenotying algorithms across diverse
demographic groups and sites; 2) to identify and characterize the genetic associations with SA and insomnia;
and 3) to identify and characterize distinct SA and insomnia patient subgroups based on related comorbidity
profiles. The proposed project has a goal of improving the treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders
by potentially resolving disease heterogeneity, discovering novel genetic associations with sleep disorders, and
helping to clarify the overlap of SA and insomnia with cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and psychiatric disease."

Recent clinical success of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 has sparked enormous interest in mRNA therapy for a
wide range of biomedical applications including protein replacement therapy. However, one unique challenge
associated with mRNA therapy is dealing with the transient efficacy due to its relatively short half-life. Current
nanoparticles including FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) could significantly improve mRNA translation
efficiency, but the duration of in vivo protein expression by these mRNA NPs is generally short (limited to a few
days), thus requiring frequent re-dosing. The main objective of this project is to advance a new transformative
LNP technology enabling long-acting mRNA replacement therapy of genetic disorders associated with loss of
function of a particular protein. In our recent studies, we developed a new generation of LNPs and performed
the head-to-head comparison in vitro and in vivo to the benchmark LNP formulations composed of FDA-approved
ionizable lipids. We observed a dramatic increase of the duration of model protein expression in vitro and in vivo
by our new mRNA LNPs. Preliminary safety studies showed that our mRNA LNPs were well tolerated without
observable adverse events in vivo. With the proof-of-concept demonstration of our long-acting mRNA LNPs, this
project aims to i) further optimize the mRNA LNP technology for longer-term, high level protein expression, and
ii) rigorously validate this transformative mRNA delivery platform using hemophilia A as a model disease. We
expect that with successful validation in normal and hemophilia A mice, this long-acting mRNA LNP platform
could be readily moved into clinical testing for hemophilia and expanded to other genetic diseases that require
restoration of normal protein functions."

 1 Carotid artery stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
 2 United States. Patients with carotid stenosis are typically managed with a combination of antiplatelet and
 3 cholesterol-lowering medications and are considered for procedural revascularization to decrease their risk of
 4 stroke. There are three different procedures for carotid revascularization: surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA),
 5 percutaneous transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF-CAS), and a procedure that was recently approved in
 6 2015, transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). The efficacy and safety of CEA and TF-CAS have been
 7 rigorously studied in more than a dozen randomized clinical trials. However, TCAR has not, and evidence
 8 supporting its use is currently limited to small single-arm prospective studies and propensity-matched analyses
 9 with limited follow up. Furthermore, the major National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized trial of carotid
10 revascularization, the Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis
11 Trial (CREST-2), which began in December 2014 and is still in progress, does not include TCAR and therefore
12 cannot resolve the question of TCARs effectiveness. Despite this, TCAR has risen to rapid popularity and is now
13 in use at 570 centers in the United States with 30,951 implants as of April 2022. The objective of this project is
14 two-fold. First, with no ongoing comparative trial of TCAR, determining how this new procedure should be used
15 in contemporary practice relies on observational research. In this proposal, we will define the 5-year risk of stroke
16 after TCAR versus CEA versus TF-CAS. We will resolve important limitations of prior published studies of TCAR,
17 including lack of long-term results, accounting for the competing risk of death, and in establishing which patients
18 are most likely to benefit from this new procedure. In doing so, we will inform both patients and clinicians what
19 role TCAR should play in their treatment plans. Second, TCAR represents an opportunity to both advance our
20 knowledge of this new procedure, and simultaneously fill key conceptual knowledge gaps in Dr. Columbo’s
21 training as a comparative-effectiveness researcher. In vascular care, it is not uncommon for procedures to be
22 implemented in patients without a randomized trial. This makes comparative-effectiveness research using
23 observational data vital to ensure that patients are receiving safe and effective care. TCAR is an excellent
24 example of why this type of research is important. This mentored award will allow Dr. Columbo to work under
25 the guidance of the mentorship team to further his development in comparative-effectiveness research using
26 observational data, training in the responsible conduct of research, interpretation and clinical applicability of the
27 findings, and grant writing. The educational objectives outlined in this proposal will complement Dr. Columbo’s
28 existing skills and provide him with a well-rounded skillset for comparative-effectiveness work. While these skills
29 will be used to evaluate TCAR in this proposal, they are broadly applicable to evaluating new procedures that
30 are introduced in the future, launching Dr. Columbo’s career as an independent investigator."
10828432,"Hemostasis is a constant balancing act between pro- and anticoagulant factors, platelets, and the vasculature
that is required to prevent excessive bleeding or pathological clotting. The anticoagulant, Tissue Factor Pathway
Inhibitor (TFPI), is a vital factor in this balance and modulates a broad range of bleeding and clotting disorders
through inhibition of TF-FVIIa, FXa, and prothrombinase (FXa-FVa). The TFPI gene is evolutionarily conserved
and due to alternative splicing, different TFPI isoforms are predominant within distinct pools. While the specific
inhibitory function of each TFPI isoform has been characterized, little is known regarding differences in isoform-
specific contributions under prothrombotic disease conditions such as Factor V Leiden (FVL) and during
embryonic development. Further, the pre-mRNA splicing and processing mechanisms dictating expression of
each isoform are unknown. As a causal relationship exists between aberrant splicing of FV and TFPI isoform-
specific function in human bleeding disorders, these mechanisms, coordinated by precise cues directed at
maintaining the hemostatic balance, are highly relevant. Thus, the long-term objective of this proposal is to
differentiate the physiological, site-specific production of each TFPI isoform at a molecular level and define their
anticoagulant function in embryonic development and disease. TFPIα is the only isoform present in platelets and
the only isoform that inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation. Additionally, global TFPI
deficiency results in prothrombotic perinatal lethality in FVL mice, and TFPIα prothrombinase inhibitory activity
is reduced in the presence of FVL. To this end, K99 phase studies probe the physiological role of TFPIα as a
regulator of FV/FVL, particularly in prothrombinase assembly on platelet surfaces during development (AIM 1)
and characterizes biological activity of new platelet-specific TFPIα splice variants identified in mice and humans
(AIM 2). The candidate will acquire technical expertise to define TFPIα anticoagulant function both in vivo using
two unique isoform- and site-specific TFPIα mutant mouse models and ex vivo using human and mouse platelets.
In AIM 3 (R00 phase), the candidate will take advantage of the evolutionary conservation of alternative TFPI
splice forms and splicing signals embedded in highly conserved sequences to determine cis-RNA element and
trans-acting splicing factor interactions regulating TFPI isoform diversity in mice and humans. Deciphering the
pre-mRNA processing mechanisms that regulate site-specific TFPI isoform expression will delineate how
alternative splicing contributes to the physiological and pathophysiological hemostatic balance during embryonic
development and in adulthood. As there are many patients with bleeding and clotting disorders of unknown
cause, the relation of aberrant splicing to these diseases represents a relatively new and unexplored area with
great potential for launching a successful independent career. This proposal also outlines an intensive training
plan of courses, seminars, and hands-on training for transitioning the candidate into a well-equipped independent
investigator with a unique combination of research skills and a highly promising basic research pipeline."
10818502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is a great interest in deriving induced neuronal (iN) cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for
central nervous system disease modeling and drug discovery. However, current differentiation methods are
laborious and inefficient, thus, identifying new ways to improve neuronal differentiation is desirable. Strikingly, in
my most recent publication I discovered that knockout of the axon guidance receptor Plexin-B2 in hNPCs
reduced cell stiffness, increased Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP) phosphorylation, and accelerated neuronal
differentiation. As a critical downstream mechanism, my preliminary data points to a pathway of Plexin-B2 altered
mechanoregulation affecting lamin-mediated nuclear envelope architecture and localization of repressive histone
marks at genomic loci containing neuron-specific genes.
 Based on these data, I will investigate an intrinsic ‘force-based’ method to generate iNs by manipulating
Plexin-B2, Angiomotin (AMOT; a mechanosensitive component of Hippo pathway), and YAP in both 2D and 3D
neuronal cultures and examine the link between Plexin-B2 and Hippo/YAP mechano-signaling in regulating
lamin-mediated nuclear physical properties, force transmission to the nuclear envelope, and changes in
chromatin accessibility during neural induction. To carry out this investigation, I propose the following aims: #1.
Investigate the impact of Plexin-B2-altered cell mechanics on neuronal differentiation, by optimizing the
differentiation method to generate iNs by both Plexin-B2 knockdown and knockout in multiple hPSC lines. I will
test the robustness, stability, and functionality of iNs by evaluating transcriptional identity, neuronal lineage,
maturation, and survival markers, electrophysiological properties, and neurotransmitter release. #2. Investigate
a mechanochemical loop between Plexin-B2 and YAP during neuronal differentiation, by performing a
comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function epistasis studies to map out the relationships between Plexin-B2, YAP,
and AMOT during neural induction and evaluate their impact on enhancing neuronal differentiation, maturation,
survival, electrophysiological functionality, and expression of major neuronal lineage markers. #3. Investigate
lamin-mediated nuclear architecture and chromatin interactions in Plexin-YAP mechano-regulation of
neuronal differentiation, by performing a comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function epistasis studies to validate
lamin as the mediator of a Plexin-B2 and Hippo/YAP intrinsically-regulated mechano-axis to promote neuronal
differentiation. I will then evaluate the role of Plexin-B2 / Hippo/YAP / lamins in releasing genomic loci harboring
neuron-specific genes from repressive chromatin at nuclear periphery to interior regions with open chromatin.
 This K01 Award will provide me training in neuronal electrophysiology, transcriptomics and epigenomics,
lab management and mentoring skills, as well as time and mentoring to develop and write my first NIH-R01.
My long-term goal is to investigate new mechano-responsive elements (MREs) underlying cell fate choices to
generate specific iNs for disease modelling and potential cell replacement therapy for neurological diseases."

The Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus aims to expand its inter-
disciplinary research capacity by developing a training program to study the determinants of periodontitis and
associated non-communicable chronic diseases in Jamaica. This program was created in response to the need
for research in periodontitis, a highly prevalent non-communicable chronic condition with implications for oral
and systemic health, for which there is lack of knowledge with respect to its epidemiology and pathophysiology
in the Caribbean region. This program will be focused on expanding the clinical, epidemiology and basic science
research capacity at the Department of Basic Medical Sciences and the Mona School of Dentistry in collaboration
with The Caribbean Institute for Health Research (CAIHR). The development of this research capacity requires
the training of clinical and basic scientists to be mentored by faculty from the University of the West Indies in
collaboration with The University at Buffalo and Rush University in the US. Trainees will be degree candidates
at the University of the West Indies enrolled in Masters or PhD programs and dental clinicians conducting post-
doctoral fellowship training, who will be part of inter-disciplinary teams that will investigate the social, behavioral,
microbiome and host response determinants of periodontitis in Jamaican subject cohorts. The specific aims of
this application are to 1) Create a core of young investigators (4 pre-doctoral basic scientists or epidemiologists
and 4 post-doctoral dentist-scientists) to conduct inter-disciplinary research in periodontal disease and
associated comorbidities in Jamaica. 2) Provide a multidisciplinary team-based mentoring approach to conduct
innovative research that integrates epidemiology, microbiome science, immunology, translational medicine and
data science. 3) Build the foundation to establish large human subject cohorts at the University of the West Indies
to study periodontal disease and associated comorbidities, thereby supporting future independent research
activities of young faculty who will train the next generation of graduate students and fellows. These objectives
will be accomplished through inter-disciplinary teams of mentors and trainees focused on evaluating the
pathophysiology of periodontitis in a cohort of children/adolescents and in an adult cohort affected by
cardiometabolic systemic disease. Customized curricula based on each trainee’s individualized development
plan will be implemented. Trainees will have a short-term (6 months) training experience in US laboratories
directed by faculty mentors with extensive experience in epidemiology, periodontology, microbiome,
bioinformatics, immunology and cardiometabolic disease, while completing their research degree or postdoctoral
programs at the University of the West Indies. This program is expected to provide a rigorous interdisciplinary
scientific training experience and create a pool of candidates with potential to join the Faculty at the University
of the West Indies. This program will also address a need for oral health research and interventions in Jamaica."
10861026,"The Candidate: I am well-positioned to become an independent academic physician-scientist and expert in
hematologic malignancies' metabolic dependencies. My commitment to improving cure-rates and decreasing
treatment toxicities for my pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients drives me. We have already
optimized cytotoxic chemotherapy to its tolerability limit. So, to meaningfully improve pediatric AML outcomes—
a devastating disease with a ~50% mortality rate—we must identify and target AML-blast dependencies. Our lab
found that the proven, well-tolerated drug atovaquone (AQ) has anti-leukemia effects. This led me to design and
conduct a limited-institution trial to (1) assess how to incorporate AQ into upfront pediatric AML treatment
regimens and (2) collect biospecimens to use in my AQ experiments. The trial has also enabled the just-opened
Children's Oncology Group Phase III trial to collect data on AQ use in newly diagnosed AML patients. My goal
is to pinpoint the mechanism by which AQ targets leukemia cells and understand and target the metabolic
pathways that sustain them. I am committed to uncovering these pathways to better treat pediatric AML.
Career Development Plan: My data demonstrating that AQ significantly suppresses AML blasts' oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has shaped my career goals. My mentorship team and the Texas Medical Center's
abundant resources, including Baylor College of Medicine's (BCM) graduate programs, will help me learn to
precisely target AML blasts' dysregulated metabolism. I will meet frequently with my primary mentor, Dr.
Sreekumar, to review data from my Aim 1a experiments and discuss results with my expert scholarship oversight
committee. My secondary mentor, Dr. Redell, will continue helping me navigate the Children's Oncology Group`s
complexities. BCM and my division will provide 75% protected research time and start-up funds in my K08
award's 4th year. I will then vie for an R01 focused on targeting pediatric AML blasts' dysregulated metabolism.
Research Plan: My work suggests that AQ induces apoptosis by inhibiting the electron transport chain's
complex III, thereby inhibiting OXPHOS. I hypothesize that OXPHOS suppression triggers the integrated stress
pathway (ISR) resulting in progression to cell death. We now know that chemotherapy-resistant AML cells
depend upon OXPHOS and that adult AML patients who take AQ for pneumonia have fewer relapses. To test
my hypothesis, I will use focused techniques to evaluate AML-cells' metabolic dependencies and AQ's impact
on them. I will use CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing and our patient-derived xenografts to determine how soluble
factors known to promote chemotherapy-resistance augment AQ-induced apoptosis and to better understand
which patients might most benefit from treatments targeting OXPHOS dependency. I will measure AQ-induced
apoptosis in a large patient sample cohort and identify an AQ-sensitivity signature by comparing RNAseq-
generated sensitive- and resistant-sample transcriptomes. Understanding AML blasts' dysregulated metabolism
will form a strong foundation on which to build my career and help find better treatments for children with AML."
10828400,"Fear is the human emotion that is elicited when danger or threat are perceived or recognized. Maladaptive fear
patterns are common in anxiety disorders. Fear responses are orchestrated by the activation of stimulus-specific
neural circuits that converge in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Drugs targeting the serotonin (5-HT) system
decrease anxiety and increasing 5-HT levels attenuates fear responses in animals. Yet, how 5-HT exerts its
effects on fear behavior is not well understood. To study fear-like responses in mice I have developed a
behavioral assay, in which a predator odor is presented in a chamber that allows for fast on- and off-set of the
stimulus. I use deep learning algorithms to analyze behavior. Using projection-specific optogenetics, I already
found that 5-HT neurons projecting to the PAG ameliorate fear-like behavior. In Aim 1 and Aim 2 I will now
determine the role of endogenous 5-HT signaling in the PAG during normal behavioral response to threat. A risk
factor for adult anxiety-like behavior is increased 5-HT during early life that causes enduring changes in 5-HT
function. Yet, how specific circuits are affected is not understood. I found that chemogenetic or pharmacologic
increases in 5-HT signaling during postnatal (P) day 2 to 11 lead to exacerbated fear responses in the adult.
Functional imaging (fMRI) in this mouse model furthermore revealed robust PAG hyperactivity in response to
predator odor. These data suggest that developmentally elevated 5-HT signaling produces long-lasting changes
in adult 5-HT input into the dlPAG resulting in increased innate fear-like behaviors. I will test this hypothesis in
Aim 3. Aim 1 uses genetically encoded 5-HT and Ca2+ sensors to simultaneously monitor 5-HT input and
glutamatergic or GABAergic output in the dlPAG during behavior via fiber photometry. Aim 2 uses Cre-
dependent inhibitory Archaerhodopsin to optogenetically inhibit 5-HT input into the dlPAG. Aim 3 uses Ca2+ and
5-HT sensors to monitor 5-HT input and neuronal output in the dlPAG during fear behavior after developmentally
elevated 5-HTergic activity. Lastly, Aim 3 also uses my established DR(5-HT)-to-dlPAG pathway specific
optogenetic protocol to enhance 5-HT signaling in dlPAG in an attempt to rescue increased fear-like responses.
Together my Aims will uncover fundamental principles that govern the modulation of the PAG by 5-HT, which
will provide insight into pathophysiology and etiology of anxiety disorders.
Throughout my training I will work towards translational discoveries targeting developmentally disrupted neural
circuits such that maladaptive behaviors can be reversed, with the overall goal of developing new therapeutic
strategies. My career development plan capitalizes on my prior experience in molecular and developmental
neurophysiology and adds expertise in circuit and behavioral neuroscience. I have engaged a strong mentoring
team to guide my scientific efforts and my growth as an independent scientist. I believe that this K01 proposal
combines pivotal technical, intellectual, and career development guidance to help me address my scientific aims
and promote my transition towards establishing an independent research program."
10788461,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 As a physician-scientist in neurodevelopmental research with a strong background in molecular
neuroscience, I seek mentored support for training in novel analytics to integrate neuroimaging and molecular
genetics data in humans, on my path toward becoming an independent investigator. I propose an integrative
project focusing on a prospective longitudinal cohort of youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis (NAPLS2)
that utilizes advances in neuroimaging analyses and high throughput, publicly available brain-wide transcriptomic
atlases to investigate neurodevelopmental mechanisms of schizophrenia (SZ) risk. Prior work suggests that
cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of SZ, with working memory (WM) typically maturing throughout
adolescence when overt clinical psychosis onset is most common, and WM depends, in part, on widely
distributed cortical glutamate- and GABA-mediated neural circuitry. However, prevention and treatment of
cognitive dysfunction in SZ is limited. This project incorporates cross-sectional and longitudinal in vivo
neuroimaging data from the NAPLS2 cohort with publicly available human postmortem brain transcriptome data
to test whether morphometric similarity networks and cognitive impairments are differentially affected in CHR
youth that develop psychosis, whether these cortical patterns are linked to behavioral measures of WM, and
whether affected frontotemporal regions have a unique pattern of glutamate/GABA transcript enrichment affected
by SZ risk genes. If these hypotheses are confirmed, the project will provide evidence that cortical alterations
are detectable prior to overt illness onset and associated with behavioral and molecular measures of cognitive
dysfunction.
 To attain these research aims, I seek formal training in imaging genomics and longitudinal analysis
methods, which is possible through structured coursework, mentoring from a team of distinguished scientists,
and UCLA’s outstanding infrastructure for genomics, neuroimaging, and psychosis research. The primary mentor
(Dr. Bearden) has internationally recognized expertise in psychosis and prospective longitudinal studies of
related neurocognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes, with extensive experience as a successful research
mentor. The core co-mentors have complementary expertise in bioinformatics and functional genomics (Dr.
Gandal) and statistical genetics methods (Dr. Pasaniuc) critical for this proposal. My collaborator (Dr. Raznahan)
has renowned expertise in developmental neuroimaging. A key consultant (Dr. Freimer) will allow for shared
bioinformatics resources and core facilities to guide analyses in large-scale functional and developmental
genomics approaches, and will provide focused training in lab leadership and career development. This K
proposal will provide me with the in-depth training in research methodology and career support necessary for a
successful transition to independence. This proposal aligns with the NIMH strategic objectives to define brain
mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and to study mental illness trajectories across the lifespan."

Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have
become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's
Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for
conducting observational AD/ADRD studies is about phenotyping – there is a lack of a centralized
repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few
methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation
data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between
medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a
rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in
observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical
modeling. To achieve that goal, we propose three specific aims in this study: (1) Aim 1 - Collect,
normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational
research; (2) Aim 2 - Develop novel algorithms to correct bias associated with phenotyping errors
when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and
disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement.
We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on
phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of
observational studies on AD/ADRD."
10839903,"Project Summary
Our global objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and regeneration
in mammalian skin and to understand how this process goes awry in inflammation and cancers.
Central to achieving this goal is to determine how stem cells sense and tailor their programs of gene
expression in order to perform their particular tasks during homeostasis and wound repair and survive
under stressful situations. Past AR31737 research has revealed that adult epidermal and hair follicle
(HF) stem cells originate from a common embryonic skin progenitor, but in adult skin, they reside in
distinct microenvironments. While maintaining some commonalities, their different niches endow
stem cells with distinct molecular properties and instructions to perform separate tasks. Upon injury,
the nearest stem cells must respond and adopt a plasticity that enables them to regenerate either
epidermis or hair follicles irrespective of the niche from whence they came. We have learned that this
`dual lineage' plasticity, transient in a wound state, is hijacked and becomes constitutive in cancer.
We've also learned that at the heart of stem cell identity and responsiveness are niche-specific
transcription factors (TFs) that act in concert with DNA effectors of environmental signals (e.g.
pSMAD1/4 for BMP signaling and LEF1/TCF1 for WNT/β-catenin signaling) to regulate key genes
whose expression must rapidly change with the environment. In yrs 39-44 of AR31737 research, we'll
now address: What are the chromatin dynamics that enable skin stem cells to choose between
epidermal and HF fates? What are the key TFs involved and how do they drive the epigenetics
needed to make these fate decisions? How do HF stem cells maintain their fate during homeostasis?
How do these stem cells enter a plastic state following injury and then change their identity to
epidermal stem cells when they find themselves in the epidermis after repair is complete? Finally, we
have discovered that chromatin remodeling in epidermal stem cells is rapid after injury and other
types of inflammatory stimuli, but once tissue homeostasis is restored and inflammation has waned,
some of these changes resolve slowly. What are the mechanisms underlying this epigenetic memory,
and how does it affect tissue fitness? To answer these questions, we will couple in vivo high
throughput technologies with our functional interrogation methods, involving in utero lentiviral delivery
of epigenetic reporter genes, inducible genes, RNAis and Crispr/CAS guide RNAs to selectively
target the skin's stem cells. At the conclusion of this research, we expect to have advanced our
knowledge of tissue homeostasis, wound-repair, inflammatory disorders and malignancies and
provided new insights to therapeutic strategies."
10838503,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 16 million Americans serve as family caregivers for a person with Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias and this care can take a physical and emotional toll. Understudied is how this informal care can affect caregiver
cognitive health and associated daily sleep and activities, all of which are modifiable health behaviors. Engaging in
personally meaningful, and cognitively stimulating activities can benefit cognitive and sleep health among dementia care
dyads. Despite the importance of activity engagement for cognitive functioning and sleep quality, existing assessment of
activities and outcomes is often self-reported asynchronously at global levels. Contemporaneous assessment of activities,
sleep, and cognitive health and well-being would significantly advance research in this area by 1) conducting objective
assessments on daily sleep and activities within a dyadic context, 2) determining how the social context of caregivers'
assistance for the individuals with dementia's activity engagement moderates the associations between cognitive health
and well-being, and daily sleep and activities, and 3) determining how a chronic stress biomarker, hair cortisol
concentration, mediates the activities- and sleep-cognition associations in naturalistic settings. The proposed mentored
career development award combines a rigorous program of research, mentorship, and didactics to facilitate the candidate's
growth toward an overall career goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on informing the design of
interventions for aging caregiving dyads with complex care needs including dementia to improve both partners' well-
being. The training aims will assist the candidate in acquiring: 1) grounded knowledge of clinical care and educational
needs among care dyads relating to neurocognitive assessment, functioning, and understanding the clinical aspects of
dementia, 2) specialized skills in the assessment, analysis, and interpretation of daily sleep and activity measures and the
biological measure of chronic stress that link to the dementia care situation and specifically to caregiver cognitive health
and well-being, and 3) expertise in the application of intensive repeated measures designs that will generate novel insights
on proximal risk and protective factors for poor caregiver outcomes within the dyadic context. The training aims seek to
further develop the candidate's expertise as an interdisciplinary researcher in the area of later-life dementia family
caregiving and align closely with the research aims to: 1) quantify caregiver daily sleep characteristics with actigraphy
and determine their associations with caregiver cognitive functioning and well-being; 2) quantify caregiver daily activity
characteristics with accelerometry and determine their associations with caregiver cognitive functioning and well-being;
and 3) To characterize how caregiver assistance for PLwD's activity engagement moderates, and how hair cortisol
concentration mediates associations of sleep➔cognition and activities➔cognition. An integrated, biopsychosocial
approach to identifying protective factors that promote resilience and reduce harmful risk factors will inform the
development of future targeted caregiver interventions in the dyadic context for a highly vulnerable aging population."
10841694,"Evidence for the roles of lipids in brain aging and Alzheimer (AD) and its related dementias (ADRD) is building.
Lipidomics is providing new insights related to altered lipid turnover and metabolism in AD and their roles in brain

Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) with centers of excellence in AD research, metabolomics/lipidomics,
informatics, machine learning, and modeling. Over the last eight years we invested major effort exploring the AD
metabolome with high-quality metabolomics/lipidomics datasets across different cohorts with rapid and broad
data sharing and transparent reporting of methods, to maximize rigor and reproducibility. We defined metabolic
failures across the trajectory of disease, connecting peripheral and central changes, delineating genetic
modulation of metabolic changes in AD effort that lead to novel targets for drug development. MPI Arnold led the
construction of the first molecular atlas for AD, a data integration resource for investigating AD and its biomarkers
in a multi-omics context. MPI Meikle, a world-renowned expert in lipidomics, has created over 50,000 plasma
lipidomic profiles from landmark studies, including AD cohorts (ADNI, AIBL, NSHDS) and the most advanced
lipidomic profiling of human brain samples from the ROS/MAP cohorts. Our recent work, incorporated lipidomic
GWAS with lipidomic profiling in AD cohorts and identified peripheral ether lipids associated with the ApoE risk
and resilience variants. Lipid metabolism changes with age, potentially mediating the effects of age, the strongest
risk factor for LOAD, on AD. However, it is unclear how age and lipid metabolism interact to affect the aging
brain and AD susceptibility. An improved understanding of these relationships will open up new opportunities for
early interventions to modify lipid metabolism pathways that modulate the immune system and preserve brain
health. We will use state-of-the-art lipidomics to enable three complementary and one exploratory aim. Aim 1
derive reproducible peripheral and central lipidomic signatures for metabolic resilience and vulnerability to
cognitive decline and calculate metabolic risk scores (MRS) that inform on AD risk and brain aging. Aim 2
catalogue the lipid-mediated effects of AD risk genotypes linked to vulnerability and resilience. Building on our
methods to characterize the lipidome associated with APOE alleles, we will use GWAS, mediation analysis and
Mendelian randomization analyses to uncover genetically modulated lipid alterations causally linked to AD and
brain aging. Aim 3: evaluate the effects of lifestyle interventions on our derived lipidomic signatures to identify
those interventions that can ameliorate lipid dysregulation to sustain brain health and prevent cognitive decline.
Exploratory aim: perform lipidomic profiling of peripheral (immune) cells to capture a cellular lipidome and relate
this to brain aging and AD pathogenesis. The outcome of our research will provide deeper understanding of role
of lipids in brain aging and in AD and will lead to novel therapeutic approaches."
10874652,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genome instability increases the rates of mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and aneuploidy and drives
many age-related human diseases, including cancer. The challenges of replicating our genome and
epigenome with each cell division requires molecular pathways that ensure the propagation of stable genomes
to daughter cells. To date, the roles of mammalian noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the maintenance of genome
stability is incompletely understood. We propose that filling this gap is essential to expand our knowledge of
human development and homeostasis and to identify novel risk factors that contribute to human disease. In
fission yeast, the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway acts during DNA synthesis at the repeats of
pericentromeres via locally produced ncRNAs to establish the heterochromatin needed for genome stability. It
is unclear if similar cell cycle-specific RNAi mechanisms of genome stability are present in mammals. In
preliminary studies, we used mouse stem cell systems to map high-confidence interactions of the RNAi
effector Argonaute (Ago) proteins with ncRNAs. We determined that Ago binds directly to pericentromeric
ncRNAs. Furthermore, we found that pericentromeric ncRNAs are overexpressed during DNA synthesis in
Ago-deficient cells and observed multiple signatures of genomic instability caused by full Ago depletion. In
parallel, previous studies in mouse models have established that overexpression of pericentromeric ncRNA
suffices to cause genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Based on these intriguing findings, we hypothesize
that pericentromeric ncRNA expression, established via cell cycle-specific Ago regulation, is critical for the
maintenance of genomic stability in mammalian cells, analogous to fission yeast. In this RO1 research project,
we examine the potential roles of RNAi in preventing genomic instability caused by accumulating
pericentromeric ncRNA and/or disruption of local heterochromatin structure. We propose to define cell cycle-
specific Ago activities to elucidate the molecular triggers for pericentromere regulation and to determine how
pericentromeric ncRNAs contribute to genome stability. In Aim 1, we will determine how and when Ago
functions at pericentromeres for the establishment of heterochromatin. In Aim 2, we determine the direct
molecular consequence of Ago recruitment to chromatin. Finally, in Aim 3, we will elucidate how ncRNAs
control Ago activity at pericentromeres during cell cycle progression. These innovative studies will answer the
long-standing question of whether the mammalian RNAi pathway contributes to the maintenance of
pericentromere heterochromatin and genome stability and will break new ground in our understanding of RNA-
mediated gene regulation. We predict these studies will drive and yield a framework for future strategies to
modulate pericentromeric ncRNA in disease settings."

Each year, over 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke. Although the vast majority survive the
acute event, over half of survivors suffer moderate to severe impairment in motor, sensory, or cognitive function.
As a consequence, stroke remains the leading cause of long-term disability, costing over $34 billion annually in
direct medical costs and indirect costs (lost productivity) in the United States. In the face of this enormous disease
burden, there are few therapies to improve stroke recovery. The brain has some intrinsic capacity for repair, but
our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains very limited. Recent studies suggest that a successful
recovery from stroke injury requires neurovascular remodeling to reorganize the damaged brain network. Indeed,
circuit repair and the resultant remapping is essential for stroke recovery. Moreover, cerebrovascular remodeling
and changes in cerebral oxygen metabolism are observed in animals and patients after stroke and are associated
with improved outcomes. Tight coordination of neural repair and cerebrovascular remodeling is likely required to
meet energy requirements of brain repair. However, the spatiotemporal coordination of neurovascular repair and
the attendant changes in oxygen metabolism after stroke remain incompletely understood. We seek to answer
these important questions by developing a new dual-modal intravital imaging technique that integrates 2-photon
fluorescence microscopy (TPM) and multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) for high-resolution, time-
lapse and comprehensive imaging of neurovascular repair and metabolic changes after stroke. To this end, we
have developed a prototype TPM-PAM system and a new cranial window with dual transparency (i.e., light and
ultrasound), long lifetime, and compatibility for awake-brain imaging. Building on the strong scientific basis, this
proposed project will focus on the development of a high-sensitivity TPM-PAM system for longitudinal imaging
of the spatiotemporal interplay of post-stroke neural repair and cerebrovascular remodeling, as well as dynamic
imaging of the coupling between neuronal activity, blood flow, and blood oxygen supply, at single-neuron single-
capillary level in the awake mouse brain. The proposed research has three specific aims: (1) develop an optically
transparent and acoustically sensitive microresonator for integration of TPM and PAM with high sensitivity, (2)
develop and validate the microresonator-based TPM-PAM for neurovascular imaging in GCaMP mice, and (3)
determine the spatiotemporal relationship between functional vascular repair and neuronal circuit repair after
stroke. Advancing our understanding of stroke repair through the development and application of TPM-PAM may
reveal promising new therapeutic targets to enhance functional recovery."

Our objective is to widely implement and evaluate a user-centered, scalable, telemedicine - linked strategy
for the routine detection of cognitive decline during the Annual Wellness Visit. Cognitive impairment is
most prevalent among adults 65 and older, yet less than half of cases are detected and/or diagnosed in primary
care settings. It is now increasingly accepted that early detection is critically important to optimize care planning,
sustained independence, management of chronic conditions and appropriate caregiver involvement. In 2011,
Medicare initiated a covered, Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that includes a cognitive assessment to detect
impairment, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). In April 2020, the Coronavirus Preparedness
and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act allowed healthcare systems to conduct AWVs remotely via
telemedicine to protect older patients at greater risk of adverse outcomes due to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The expansion of telemedicine as a viable means of healthcare deliver is likely to continue. While
this presents new opportunities for case finding, implementation of AWVs in primary care, including how cognitive
function is assessed, has been variable. Clinicians often rely on more basic, “paper”-based, interviewer-
administered cognitive tests that may be less precise and more cumbersome to clinical workflow – affecting the
fidelity of an early detection strategy. Further, many practices lack a clear protocol for referral when impairment
is determined, and a process for family involvement and establishing care goals. Practical, sustainable, scalable
strategies are urgently needed to help primary care providers routinely assess cognitive function as part of AWVs
(or whenever a cognitive impairment is suspected), identify concerns and have a protocol for referrals and care
management.
Northwestern developed and continues to innovate the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and
Behavioral Function®. Since 2017, our team has worked closely with primary care practices to develop a brief,
technology-enabled, self-administered, EHR-linked cognitive assessment (MyCog) derived from the NIH Toolbox.
We also devised a detailed protocol for its use and how results of a 5-7 minute test, can inform patient care. We
now propose creating MyCog Mobile to enhance, validate and evaluate the feasibility of the administration of a
brief cognitive assessment to detect MCI or AD delivered within an Annual Wellness visit conducted via
telemedicine.
Our primary aims are to: 1) Adapt the MyCog paradigm for use in telemedicine using patients’ own smartphones;
2). Validate MyCog Mobile in an existing, well-characterized and diverse cohort of adults ages 65-85; and 3).
Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of MyCog Mobile implementation in a primary care practice as
preparation for future large-scale testing."

Current drug resistance surveillance for leprosy is solely based on the monitoring of clinical symptoms and
the molecular identification of specific mutations in known drug resistance genes, which are few and fail to
encompass the range of molecular mechanisms responsible for treatment failure. We used comparative
genomics of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Mycobacterium leprae strains to identify novel molecular
markers of antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Top candidate genes whose polymorphism potentially associated
with drug resistance were characterized using a surrogate Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)
since M. leprae cannot be cultured in vitro. Our preliminary results show that the deletion of one candidate
gene in particular, fadD9, in M. tuberculosis significantly enhances dapsone resistance. Analysis of the
potential function of this gene combined with the results of an earlier metabolomics study on the effects of
antifolates on M. tuberculosis metabolism point to the existence of a previously unknown target of dapsone,
independent of the FolP1 enzyme from the folate pathway, the deleterious pharmacological inhibition of which
is mitigated by mutations reducing or inhibiting the activity of FadD9. This exploratory project aims to
characterize these new mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to dapsone in mycobacteria.
Specifically, we hypothesize that dapsone inhibits the g-aminobutyrate (GABA) aminotransferase, GabT,
responsible for the production of succinate semialdehyde (SSA) from GABA, thereby limiting the amount of
succinate entering the TCA cycle through the GABA shunt. We further hypothesize that FadD9 converts the
product of GabT, SSA, to succinaldehyde and that loss of/reduced function mutations in FadD9 thus prevent
the limited amounts of SSA produced by the dapsone-inhibited GabT from being diverted away from the TCA
cycle.
Aim 1 will use genetic and enzymatic approaches to test the hypothesis that dapsone inhibits GabT. Aim 2
will similarly use a combination of cell-free and whole cell-based approaches to test the hypotheses that (i)
FadD9 converts SSA to succinaldehyde and that (ii) clinically-relevant mutations lead to reduced or loss of
FadD9 activity. Aim 3 will finally attempt to correlate different levels of dapsone resistance in a collection of
well-defined M. leprae isolates to the presence of mutations in folP1, fadD9, and/or potentially gabT, in the
same isolates."
10818444,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Cellular Senescence is as an acquired state cells enter in response to environmental stressors or tumor
evasion. Senescent cells cease their proliferative capacity and enhance their ability to respond and regulate
the microenvironment through the senescence-associated secretory phonotype (SASP). Another shared
characteristic of cellular senescence is the upregulation of the tumor suppressor cyclin inhibitor p16INK4a. With
age there’s accumulation of senescence cells in tissues along with the upregulation of p16INK4a expression.
While removal of p16INK4a expressing cells using genetic mouse tools slows down aging, it also adversely
impacts wound healing during injury repair, suggesting contradictory roles of p16INK4a during homeostasis and
injury response. We generated an ultra-sensitive p16INK4a reporter mouse line name, named INK4A H2B-GFP
Reporter-In-Tandem, or INKBRITE to further understand in vivo p16INK4+ cells. In INKBRITE adult lungs,
p16INK4+ cells are predominantly within immune and fibroblasts populations. p16INK4+ fibroblasts express
features of senescence including polyploidy, increase in cell size, low proliferation capacity and ability to
promote airway epithelial cell growth after injury. My main goal is to determine if the capacity to promote
regeneration is restricted to airway p16INK4+ and epithelium or other regionally specific p16INK4 expressing
fibroblast can support epithelial growth. Whether the capacity to promote epithelial regeneration is restricted to
airway p16INK4+ fibroblasts or other spatially defined fibroblast subpopulations such as alveolar fibroblast can
promote epithelial growth through SASP, remains unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, I will isolate alveolar
p16INK4a+ fibroblasts and determine their capacity to promote epithelial growth after acute epithelial injury by 1)
ex vivo 3D co-culture assay, 2) identify the transcribed SASP through RNA sequencing, and 3) in vivo using
known senolytics Dasatinib and Quercetin (D&Q). Our p16INK4a induction and knockdown studies showed the
requirement of p16INK4a for expression of known SASP factors such as IL6, Ereg, Ccl8. Another aspect that has
been largely underexplored in the identity and dependence p16INK4 expression of SASP factors in vivo. For the
R00 phase of my proposed work, I will further explore how the expression of p16INK4 is able to reprogram the
SASP to support tissue repair, specifically epithelial regeneration. I will with our tools to functionally induce and
remove p16INK4 in fibroblasts and 1) asses epithelial growth, 2) transcriptome analysis, and 3) proteomics to
capture secreted proteins to identify p16INK4a-dependent SASP factors. I have extensive knowledge on working
with INKBRITE and the tools to manipulate p16 INK4a expression which will allow me to pursue the proposed
work with ease. With additional training from Drs. Peng and Sheppard I will expand my current knowledge of
lung biology and cellular senescence while establishing a new protocol of identifying secreted proteins in vivo
that will serve as a unique skillset for my transition to my own lab. These studies will lay foundation for our
understanding of diverse roles of SASP factors during homeostasis and injury."
10850714,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Asthma remains a serious public health threat with unmet therapeutic needs. The
development of successful therapies relies a more in-depth understanding of the immune
subsets and pathways involved. MAIT cells are innate-like T cells that recognize microbial
riboflavin metabolites presented by MR1 and can function through both TCR dependent and
independent pathways. Interestingly, previous studies indicated an inverse association between
MAIT cells and human asthma. The precise role of MAIT cells in asthma development and
exacerbation, however, remains unknown. Our recently published work and additionally
preliminary data indicate a striking anti-inflammatory role for MAIT cells in allergic airway
inflammation. We hypothesize that a deficiency of MAIT cells in asthma patients contributes to
exacerbated airway inflammatory responses to allergens, and that increasing MAIT cell
numbers may help alleviate allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.
Using fresh lung samples from deceased organ donors, we will examine the abundance and
molecular properties of lung-resident MAIT cells in severe asthma patients and control
individuals without lung diseases. We will use MAIT cell deficient mice and adoptive transfer
strategies to interrogate the specific roles of MAIT cells in allergic airway inflammation. Finally,
we will test whether boosting the number of MAIT cells by an engineered probiotic strain can
help alleviate ongoing airway inflammation induced by common allergens."

functional aging across the continuum of cancer. Recent advances across a range of digital technologies,
including wearable devices, unobtrusive sensors, and passive data collection applications would provide a more
nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the presentation and progression of functional aging trajectories

 Gone with the wind is the time when skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were once readily treatable
bacterial infections with over-the-counter ointments consisting of topical antibiotics such as bacitracin, neomycin
and polymyxin B. With the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the so-called
“superbug” and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDPA), coupled with the dwindling number of
available broad-spectrum topical antibiotics, treatment of SSTIs has become increasingly problematic. Currently,
only three prescription-only topical antibiotics are still effective in the treatment of SSTIs caused by multi-drug
resistant bacteria. These include mupirocin (Bactroban®) and fusidic acid (not approved for clinical use in the
US yet) effective against MRSA, and polymyxin B (prescription-strength) effective against MDPA. To improve
treatment outcomes, a broad-spectrum oral or injectable fluoroquinolone antibiotic (e.g., ciprofloxacin) is often
prescribed in combination with one of these topical antibiotics. Such practice inadvertently contributes to the
overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Many experts believe that there are now few clinical circumstances in which
prescription of topical antibiotics is still appropriate and may not be a feasible treatment option at all for SSTIs
by the end of this decade.
 In response to the urgent medical need in the treatment of SSTIs caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, we
propose to develop a new broad-spectrum topical antimicrobial ointment incorporating bismuth oxide
nanoparticles (Bi2O3 NPs) as an over-the-counter medication in place of conventional topical, oral or injectable
antibiotics. Additionally, this new antimicrobial ointment has an extremely low likelihood of developing Bi
resistance. As the result, it may have potential for widespread use in a variety of situations ranging from the
prophylactic care of minor skin injuries to the treatment of burn wound infections. Our broad and long-term
objectives of this proposal are: (1) to perform extensive formulation studies to reach the optimal conditions for
the incorporation of Bi2O3 NPs into an appropriate ointment base; and (2) to select three best ointments identified
from the in vitro effectiveness studies for the evaluation of their in vivo efficacy. Therefore, the specific aims of
this research include: (1) formulating Bi2O3 NPs into topical antimicrobial ointments (Aim 1); and (2) evaluating
the in vivo efficacy of Bi2O3 NP ointments (Aim 2).
 The completion of these two specific aims will lead to the development of a new broad-spectrum topical
antimicrobial ointment incorporating Bi2O3 NPs to combat SSTIs caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria in place
of conventional topical, oral or injectable antibiotics, thus impacting the landscape of antibiotic stewardship."
10807038,"Project Description
 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most challenging subtype to treat among all breast cancer cases
due to lack of cell surface receptors. Patients with metastatic TNBC have median overall survival of only 13.3
months with treatment. Newly approved immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 antibody only extend the
survival by 2-4 months when used with chemotherapy, and the efficacy highly relies on expression of targets
such as PD-L1 in tumors. Despite new treatment options, metastatic TNBC is predominantly treated by highly
potent chemotherapy, with combination therapy being advantageous over single agents regarding response rate
and overall survival. However, the drugs in combination chemotherapy have distinct physicochemical properties
that hinders formulation into single dosage; their distinct pharmacokinetic behavior hinders the in vivo synergism.
Furthermore, these drugs are non-specific to cancer cells and often show systemic toxicity. Our long-term goal
is to develop advanced and well-characterized drug delivery approaches to improve treatment outcomes of drugs
and drug combinations. In this project, we propose a dual-drug loaded dual-peptide ligand incorporated drug
combination nanoparticle (DCNP) approach for targeting and inhibition of metastatic TNBC. The lipid-based
DCNP leverage on effective gemcitabine and paclitaxel combination in clinic to deliver both drugs in prolonged
and synchronized manner. Through incorporation of two peptide ligands that targets TNBC cells (through ICAM-
1) and tumor vasculature (through endoglin), the DCNP could target both primary tumor and metastasis for
enhanced chemotherapy. Furthermore, both drugs are reported to upregulate PD-L1 and reduce population of
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor. These effects can sensitize TNBC cells for PD-1/PD-L1
therapy. The DCNPs that synchronize and co-deliver both drugs may further augment such effects thus generate
improved chemoimmuno therapeutic outcomes. The objectives of this project are to validate the concepts of
improved targeting and chemotherapy of metastatic TNBC with a dual-targeting DCNP approach and enhanced
combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In Aim 1, we will prepare ligands-incorporated DCNPs
with high drug loading, proper size, and good stability, and test their cellular binding and efficacy, and effects on
cancer cell expression of PD-L1. In Aim 2, we will validate enhanced in vivo targeting efficiency with the dual-
ligand strategy and correlate it with expression levels of receptors and evaluate inhibition of primary tumor and
metastasis with monitoring of survival. In Aim 3, we will assess the upregulation of PD-L1 and reduction of
MDSCs by the DCNPs and carry out a pilot survival study with a chemoimmuno combination regimen. If
successful, this targeted drug combination strategy could substantially improve the treatment of metastatic TNBC.
Through tuning composition and targeting ligands, this highly translatable nanoformulation technology can be
potentially used for existing and future drug combinations to treat various metastatic cancers."

Insects infect hundreds of millions of people annually with deadly viruses and parasites. The goal of the
proposed project is to decipher the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating the insect sense of taste,
with the long-term goal of using these insights to develop new insect control strategies. The proposed work will
exploit the sophisticated arsenal of tools available for studying the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to
address fundamental questions in the insect taste field. The aims will employ a wide diversity of approaches,
including electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging, behavioral assays, molecular genetics, and cell biology. The project
will leverage insights from Drosophila to attack similar problems in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The sense of
taste is not only essential for mosquito survival, allowing them to discriminate nutritious from dangerous foods,
but assists them in making the final decision to bite a human or fly away. Currently, the receptors that function
in mosquito taste are largely unknown. In this proposal, we outline experiments focusing on three poorly-
understood areas in insect taste: fatty acid taste, amino acid taste, and acid taste. Drosophila find low levels of
fatty acids attractive and high levels aversive. The goal of aim 1 is to decipher the receptor and neuronal
mechanisms that underlie this discrimination. We will test the model that low fatty acid levels stimulate feeding
by activating an amplification cascade initiated by a G-protein coupled receptor and culminating with a TRP
channel in cells that stimulate attraction, whereas high levels of fatty acids directly activate a TRP channel in
cells that cause repulsion. Fatty acids are potent antifeedants that suppress biting by Aedes. We will test
whether the TRP homolog in Aedes aegypti mediates this effect. Aim 2 is to define the receptor and neuronal
mechanisms underlying amino acid taste. This is important because flies must consume essential amino acids
for growth and egg production. We will test the ideas that: 1) within taste neurons of the fly tongue, a
Drosophila TRP senses amino acids in food, and 2) the same TRP detects circulating levels of amino acids in
the brain. We will also test the idea that the Aedes TRP homolog is an amino acid sensor. Aim 3 addresses the
identity of the proton channel that functions in acid taste. Low levels of some acids are attractive, but high
levels are toxic. We will test the idea that a H+ sensor is required in multiple types of taste neurons in the
Drosophila proboscis to prevent ingestion of dangerous levels of acids. Acid taste is also important in Aedes to
suppress consumption of toxic acids in food, yet carboxylic acids are present in human sweat. We will test
whether the Aedes homolog of the Drosophila H+ sensor functions in acid taste. In summary, the proposed
research will reveal the receptor mechanisms underlying poorly understood areas in Drosophila taste, and
includes the development of a key new molecular genetic tool to facilitate work in Aedes. This project has the
long-term potential to lead to the development of innovative strategies to deter biting and reduce devastating
mosquito-borne diseases."

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and exercise intolerance are hallmark symptoms of heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). The mechanisms of these symptoms are unknown, and no therapeutic strategy exists
for these debilitating symptoms. As such, NHLBI working groups recommend prioritizing studies that advance
understanding of HFpEF-related (patho)physiology and the primary causes of symptoms in these patients so that
novel therapeutics can be developed. DOE and exercise intolerance are also very common symptoms of obesity.
Obesity has reached epidemic levels and affects four-in-ten American adults. The prevalence of obesity rises to
eight-in-ten adults in the HFpEF population yet, the role of obesity in provoking symptoms of DOE and exercise
intolerance in HFpEF patients has, thus far, been neglected. Human studies demonstrate that obesity affects
breathing mechanics, whereby lung volume subdivisions and maximal expiratory flow are decreased, which
increases the risk of expiratory flow limitation, dynamic hyperinflation, and an altered breathing pattern during
exercise. All these obesity-related mechanical ventilatory constraints ultimately 1) increase the oxygen (O2) cost of
breathing and 2) impose a mechanical ceiling on ventilation (V̇E) during exercise, which could provoke DOE and
reduce exercise capacity. Thus, we hypothesize that obesity is likely a significant contributor to DOE and exercise
intolerance in patients with HFpEF. To date, the O2 cost of breathing and the effect of obesity-related mechanical
ventilatory constraints on DOE and exercise intolerance remains untested in patients with HFpEF. Therefore, the
overall aim of this K99/R00 proposal is to 1) investigate the O2 cost of breathing and examine how this impacts
DOE and peak exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF, and 2) reduce obesity-related mechanical ventilatory
constraints to potentially reduce DOE and increase exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF. To accomplish these
goals, we will 1) investigate the interaction of HFpEF (underlying changes in pulmonary function) and obesity
(obesity-related changes in pulmonary function) on the O2 cost of breathing during eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea,
and its association with DOE during constant load exercise and peak exercise capacity, and 2) investigate the effects
of breathing a low density helium-oxygen gas mixture (HeO2: 21% O2 and 79% He), which reduces obesity-related
mechanical ventilatory constraints (HeO2 increases maximal expiratory flow, reduces the work of breathing,
decreases expiratory flow limitation & dynamic hyperinflation, and increases VT expansion), on DOE during
constant load exercise and peak exercise capacity. We anticipate these investigations will 1) further understanding
of the role of obesity in provoking symptoms of DOE and exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients, 2) identify new
mechanisms underlying symptoms of DOE and exercise intolerance, which could dramatically alter conventional
thinking about the primary causes of these symptoms in patients with HFpEF, and 3) provide new targets for
independent investigation so that novel therapeutic strategies can be developed and enable new paradigms for
personalized therapy in HFpEF."

transform the landscape of oral health care. Yet, even with improved opportunities, social and economic
inequality, structural discrimination, and a fragmented health care system have resulted in continued disparities
and in access to the profession for marginalized groups. The purpose of the proposed project is to establish
high levels of oral health literacy that is meant to translate into improved overall health for all individuals and
communities across the lifespan by creating accessible and easily disseminated educational modules that
combine the health sciences, STEM, and the humanities. Through exploring historical case studies,
investigating advancements in dental technology, learning about trailblazers in dentistry from diverse

gain an understanding of how oral health care has progressed and how they too can fit into the story of the
profession, whether that means becoming better patients through learning about proper oral health care or by
starting on the path to join the dental profession after learning about its importance, inclusivity, and impact on
the world around them with these modules. Modules tailored to different grade levels will ensure that learners

The Communicating Data project engages secondary school teachers and students from both rural and urban
areas in Maine and New Hampshire as citizen scientists in collecting both private and public drinking water
samples for heavy metal analysis and communicating their findings with a goal of improving public health in their
communities. This new project will build on our current SEPA project which has a focus on arsenic in private
well water in rural communities. Based on what we are learning in our first project, that nearly all communities
have a mix of some public water systems as well as private wells, we will provide a more inclusive experience
for students by having them collect home drinking water samples for analysis, no matter what the source. We
will provide curriculum on drinking water systems so that students can identify their source of drinking water.
While our first project focused on arsenic in wells, many schools found that uranium and lead and other
contaminants were also issues that need attention. So, we will develop curriculum that addresses multiple
drinking water contaminants and provide training for teachers in these areas. We have already developed data
literacy tools and curriculum that will serve teachers and students in this new project. With these supports in
place, our new SEPA project will focus on helping students create data visualizations so that they can more
effectively communicate their findings to diverse audiences. We know from surveys of homeowners who
contributed well water samples in the first years of our current project, that the likelihood of mitigating arsenic in
drinking water was related to the extent of parent-child interactions in the home. To further support these
interactions, we will also focus on intergenerational learning. In guided focus sessions with parents, we will get
their input on developing appropriate at-home conversation prompts and sink-side activities to engage families
more actively in understanding the importance of healthy drinking water. We anticipate that this approach,
combined with our expanded focus on multiple contaminants in drinking water from homes dependent on either
private or public drinking water sources in either urban or rural environments will enable us to more broadly
disseminate our project and facilitate its replicability in other geographic areas.

10663671,"Project Summary
Over 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and many use cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD), a
constituent of cannabis, to treat their pain. Despite state-wide cannabis legalization and mainstream promotion
of the medical benefits of these products, there are few carefully controlled empirical studies assessing the
effects of cannabis and CBD when used repeatedly or used in combination. Pre-clinical studies show CBD
enhances the analgesic efficacy of cannabis while attenuating its abuse-related properties, but the effect of
repeated CBD use on cannabis-induced analgesia and abuse liability in humans is not known. In the proposed
randomized, counterbalanced, human laboratory study, healthy adult cannabis smokers (N=72; 36M, 36F) will
be randomized to receive one of four CBD doses (0, 50, 100, 300 mg/day) for 15 days. On days 1, 8, and 15,
they will participate in a laboratory session, where they will smoke 75% of a cannabis cigarette (7% THC) and
we will measure the time-course of abuse-related subjective effects (good drug effect, high) and experimental
pain using two mechanistically distinct paradigms (Cold Pressor Test, Quantitative Sensory Testing) over 3
hours. We will then assess whether CBD alters cannabis’s reinforcing effects by providing participants the
opportunity to self-administer up to 4 additional puffs of cannabis (7% THC). This study will answer two critical
questions: Does daily oral CBD administration alter: 1) the abuse-related and reinforcing effects of smoked
cannabis; 2) the analgesic effects of smoked cannabis. In addition to contributing novel data regarding the
interaction between CBD and cannabis, this proposal will provide critical training needed to achieve my goal of
becoming an independently funded researcher. Specifically, this mentored research scientist development
application will advance my career by providing essential: (1) experience in human laboratory model study
design and methodology, specifically to evaluate cannabinoids on abuse-and pain-related endpoints, and (2)
training in statistics and grantsmanship. My past pre-clinical research experience combined with the goals I
have set forth within this application will allow me to gain the skills and experiences to become an independent
research scientist translating findings from pre-clinical animal models into human laboratory studies."
10870105,"ABSTRACT
To maintain its status as the worldwide leader in research, the United States must realize the tremendous
scientific power inherent within its diverse population. Currently, much of this potential, however, remains latent,
as Black, Hispanic, and Native American students are underrepresented in college STEM majors, STEM PhD
programs, the professoriate, and the STEM workforce. The creation of holistic K-12 programs that spark student
interest in science, empower their academic pursuits, and provide them with bona fide research experiences is
essential to enhance the migration of talented, STEM-focused, minoritized students into college STEM majors.
Such efforts are critical for the U.S. to realize the immense latent scientific potential contained within its diverse
population. By leveraging established partnerships with community K-12 organizations, and listening to the
needs of our partners and their students, we have sculpted a new, integrated program that will provide holistic
training and support to minoritized, low-income high school students to help them succeed in STEM. A key
feature of our program is that we will leverage the interest and intellect of undergraduate, post-bac, and PhD
students in the diversity-focused programs we run to ensure that high school students are mentored by STEM
role models who look like them.
Aim 1: To create educational programs that address partner-identified STEM education gaps and to determine
if student participation in these programs increases science literacy, scholastic success, college matriculation,
and motivation to pursue scientific careers relative to non-participating students. We hypothesize these activities
will have strong, positive impact on students because we are addressing specific needs defined by their
educational organizations. Aim 2: To determine whether the context in which research experiences are delivered
impacts motivation to enter STEM fields. We hypothesize that, in our student population, research experiences
focused on health disparities that disproportionately affect Black people will be more motivating for long-term
scientific engagement compared with similar research projects that lack this societal context.
We partner with Jennings High School, The Sophia Project, and The Village. The demographics of our partners
resemble those of the Jennings School District, where over 98% of the students are Black, all qualify for the Free
Federal Lunch program, and 38% of school age children live in poverty. At Jennings, high school graduation
rates exceed 90%, but less than half of these students enter a two- or four-year college. Most students lack
academic/STEM role models as well as opportunities to learn about and pursue an interest in STEM. Our
program then possesses immense potential to positively impact the confidence and college and career choice
of these students and thus help diversify the next generation of scientists."
10833206,"The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance Dr. Scott
Halpern’s ability to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and
testing strategies to improve fairness in the enrollment and analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) among
patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure, thereby leading to more equitable care for such patients.
During his initial K24, Dr. Halpern completed 3 scientific aims that help augment the efficiency of such RCTs,
and 3 career development goals that made him a more effective mentor. Milestones completed during the
initial K24 include his primarily mentoring 7 new individuals to receive NIH K awards and 8 mentees to earn 14
R01 or equivalent independent research grants. Motivated by his team’s increased commitments to health
equity, this renewal K24 proposes new scientific aims that will improve the equity of enrollment in and analysis
of respiratory failure RCTs while helping Dr. Halpern develop new skills in training more junior mentors,
building infrastructures that catalyze successful mentorship, and developing and applying equitable prediction
models to guide care and predict outcomes for patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure.
 The new scientific aims of this K24 renewal will leverage the resources and patients enrolling in several
new initiatives of Dr. Halpern’s Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. Aims 1a and 1b will
test the hypotheses that using mobile patient recruitment strategies and behavioral economic approaches to
framing consent decisions will improve the diversity and representativeness of respiratory failure RCTs. These
aims will leverage parallel insights being developed through his recently established Behavioral Economics to
Transform Trial Enrollment Representativeness (BETTER) Center, funded by the American Heart Association
to enable more equitable enrollment in cardiovascular RCTs. Dr. Halpern will also lead qualitative interviews
among patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure engaged in prospective cohort studies led by several
of his mentees. Aims 2a and 2b will use patient-level data from 15 RCTs completed by the PAIR Center or
NHLBI’s ARDSNet and PETAL Networks to determine whether the 7 predictive models most commonly used
for risk adjustment in respiratory failure RCTs perform equitably across groups defined by race, ethnicity, and
sex, and to identify features of these models that are associated with inequitable performance. These latter
aims will provide essential insights for Dr. Halpern’s team’s future efforts to develop more equitable models.
 Renewal of this K24 award would enable Dr. Halpern to quell growth in his administrative
responsibilities and thus (1) maintain the time he currently commits to mentoring, (2) attend meetings to learn
from more senior mentors and research leaders and to train his junior faculty mentees to develop their own
mentoring skills, and (3) grow his national impact on POR mentoring by supporting his training in research
leadership and growth of the “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program” he established under his original K24."
10889226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The role of dopamine in health and disease has been investigated for decades. Dopamine
receptor agonists or antagonists are used for the treatment diseases such as schizophrenia,
depression, attention deficit disorder and Parkinson's disease. Recent work also indicates that
the altered regulation of dopamine release induced by many drugs of abuse play a critical role
in early processes linked to early aspects of addiction. Thus knowledge of the physiological role
of endogenous dopamine in the central nervous system is necessary.
This proposal uses recordings from dopamine neurons of the Substantia Nigra in brain slices
from mouse to (1) Identify the distribution of D2 receptors on distinct dendritic projections. (2)
Define sites of dopamine release, determine the time course of the presence of dopamine in the
extracellular space following synaptic release and the time course of the dopamine/D2-
receptor interaction that underlies the inhibitory postsynaptic potential. (3) Characterize
plasticity of D2-receptors focusing on heterologous desensitization between GPCRs and the
acute application of cocaine. Finally, future experiments will determine how D2-receptor
function and distribution are altered following treatment of animals with cocaine. The results
of this study will form a connection between D2 receptor dependent synaptic events and the
early events following treatment with cocaine. This knowledge will add to the decades long
search for an understanding of the role of dopamine in health and disease."
10844580,"Abstract: Opioid misuse has become a public health epidemic in the United States with more than 70% of indi-
viduals with an opioid use disorder (OUD) never receiving any sort of treatment. Even fewer receive medications
for addiction treatment (MAT)—the gold standard for treatment and a safe, cost-effective way to reduce the risk of
overdose while improving the likelihood of sustained recovery. Due to the stigma surrounding opioid misuse, in-
dividuals often seek non-conventional ways to recover, such as using online resources, specifically social media,
and in particular microblogging sites like Twitter. However, social media platforms are often rife with MAT misin-
formation (MATM), posing a serious barrier to recovery. Moreover, the harmful effects of online misinformation
are further exacerbated by the design of the algorithms that drive content curation or recommendation on social
media sites. Yet, research on understanding algorithmic pathways to health-misinformation is rare and that re-
lated to opioid misuse is practically non-existent. This R21 proposal will address this gap by conducting formative
research through the use of robust audit methodologies coupled with rigorously validated machine learning (ML)
techniques, to lay bare an unexplored phenomena in the OUD medication and treatment domain—algorithmically
curated MATM in online social media systems, specifically Twitter—one of the most widely used social media
platforms for sharing and seeking OUD information. The work advances this research agenda by leveraging the
team’s pioneering research in addressing two of the key technical challenges driving this proposal: a) building
computational approaches to audit black-box platform algorithms that curate, recommend, or filter information
viewed by end users; and 2) developing ML techniques that detect pre-existing or emergent online misinforma-
tion. Drawing from advances in algorithmic audit work and PI’s own successful audit study designs, Aim 1 will
build tools and methodologies to audit search and recommendation algorithms for MATM on Twitter across vari-
ous individual user characteristics and algorithmic inputs. The developed methodologies will be generic enough
to be adaptable across other social media platforms. In Aim 2, we will leverage these methodologies to conduct
an exhaustive set of carefully controlled audit experiments on Twitter to investigate it’s search and recommenda-
tion algorithms’ tendency to surface MATM. We will also develop and evaluate ML methods that can automatically
determine whether the collected social media posts contain MATM. Finally, in Aim 3 we will develop a mixed-
methods approach to quantitatively and qualitatively validate our audit results with participants on Twitter who
misuse opioids. The project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists and a clinical psychol-
ogist, with expertise in social media analytics and recruitment, online algorithmic audits, substance use disorders,
machine learning, and natural language processing. The knowledge we produce will set the stage for future re-
search in early detection of risky OUD behaviors, understanding the role of the online information environment in
exacerbating or preventing OUD risks and launching evidence-based interventions to mitigate such risks."
10840844,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A central promise of genome editing is its potential to treat monogenic disease. Despite early-stage clinical
progress for CRISPR-Cas based approaches, monogenic neurodegenerative conditions and nucleotide triplet
expansion disorders have not been a focus of any biotechnology company in this space. Our proposal brings
together a team of academic investigators to develop a synergistic suite of first-in-class CRISPR-Cas based
therapeutics for Huntington's disease (HD) and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We will engineer
and deploy an editing approach that excises, with IND-grade potency and mutant allele-selectivity, the disease-
causing expansion repeat from human HTT and C9ORF72 loci, respectively. Our strategy is based on identifying
alleles of commonly heterozygous SNPs that reside on the same haplotype as the disease-causing repeat
expansion, and then engineering CRISPR-Cas9 for high selectivity of cleavage, on one or both sides of the
mutant allele repeat, to drive its excision, with two tiers of delivery innovation. Our trailblazer project (Research
Project 1, RP1) will develop an HD therapeutic by packaging mutant HTT-specific CRISPR-Cas9 into a newly
developed serotype of adeno-associated virus (AAV) with robust and broad biodistribution in the brain
parenchyma of nonhuman primates (NHP). We will implement an innovative strategy in which the CRISPR-Cas9
cassette temporally limits its own expression. We will identify and advance the preclinical lead composition
through IND-enabling studies leveraging 3 dedicated Resource Cores to (i) assess molecular outcomes at the
genetic level, (ii) administer reagents to animals and observe their behavior, and (iii) assess molecular and
histological outcomes from cells and animal tissues. An Administrative Core led by experienced developers of
genome editing-based therapeutics, will provide project-management support and lead on preparation of
regulatory submissions, aiming to file an HD IND by program end. In RP2, we will apply the AAV-based excision
approach to build a cognate experimental therapeutic for C9ORF72-driven ALS. Synergies with RP1 include
CMC innovation to manufacture novel AAV, re-use of the self-regulating CRISPR-Cas cassette and virus
harboring it, and regulatory feedback on IND-enabling pharmacology, toxicology, and biodistribution studies. We
will advance RP2 through pre-IND. For RP3, we will establish a first-in-class, transformative paradigm for in vivo
genome editing therapy by reformulating the preclinical lead CRISPR-Cas9 combination used in RP1 into a
highly innovative “Cas9 RNP monoparticle” in which amphiphilic peptides deliver the gene editor to neurons
upon injection. We will develop approaches for monoparticle manufacture to enable ex vivo and in vivo efficacy
studies in HD models. Extensive synergies with RP1 project and comprehensive support by the RCs will enable
us to advance this approach to pre-IND by program end. The sum total of this effort will establish a fundamentally
new paradigm for in vivo genome editing applicable to all nucleotide repeat expansion disorders, and advance
preclinical lead formulations for one disease, HD, to IND, and another such disease, C9ORF ALS, to pre-IND."

The Correction of Neurological Disease via Allele Specific Excision of Pathogenic Repeats (CASEPR) program
comprises three Research Projects (RPs) and three Resource Cores (RCs), which the Administrative Core (AC)
will coordinate to advance one RP through IND submission, and the other two RPs through early regulatory
review. The AC will provide rigorous, project management and day-to-day administrative program coordination,
planning, and evaluation, while developing and ensuring compliance with IND-grade practices for assessing
molecular potency, disease-modifying efficacy, and safety. The AC will oversee the total budget, collect invoices,
manage payments, and coordinate inter-campus charges. The AC will adopt a collaborative process, working
with PIs to develop a shared vision, formulate guidance, provide oversight, ensure compliance, proactively
resolve issues, initiate early and frequent FDA contact, and maintain overall continuity.
Dedicated AC staff (1 full time equivalent) will develop detailed Gantt charts in close consultation with RP PIs,
and will provide industry gold-standard project management support within each RP and across the entire effort.
The AC Project Manager (PM) will monitor CASEPR activities daily to remove obstacles, coordinate in-person
and virtual meetings, record minutes, manage action items, facilitate communication, manage travel, allocate
resources responsive to CASEPR needs, and prepare technical summary and financial reports for leadership.
With the goal of ensuring a consistent interface between the RPs and RCs, and leveraging the unique
infrastructure and expertise of the IGI Clinical Laboratory, the AC will coordinate the instantiation of a dedicated
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that will be used for requisition, accession, and resulting of
specimens submitted by RP personnel to RCs.
The AC PI and PM will play a central and enabling role in all aspects of ensuring timely advance of RP1 (the
trailblazer project) through every stage of regulatory review (INTERACT, pre-IND, IND), and RP2 and RP3
through INTERACT and pre-IND. To this end the AC will work with the RC PIs to ensure timely and consistent
representation of key data in study reports for submission to the Agency. Further, leveraging institutional depth
in developing experimental therapeutics for neurodegeneration at the UCSF and OHSU, the AC will prepare
drafts of key documentation (clinical protocol, investigator’s brochure) required for IND submission. The AC PI
will ensure implementation of the research plan and will play a critical role facilitating communication among all
program components, monitoring progress across Gantt-specified timelines, milestones, and endpoints, and
ensuring effective use and integration of all proposed shared resources. To help create a shared learning,
training, and education hub, the AC will facilitate and participate in the learning and dissemination programs of
the Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center (TCDC). The PI will provide the TCDC with information
about the overall approach, including lead identification, optimization, and obtaining the IND."

The goal of this proposal is to develop a high-fidelity adaptive electrical interface to the retina and use it to
investigate the contributions of the parallel visual pathways (M and P, ON and OFF) to the perception and
behavior of macaque monkeys. The device will operate bi-directionally at the resolution of single cells and
single spikes, and will adapt itself to the diversity of cell types and locations in the host neural circuitry.
We build on our extensive work in isolated primate retina, which demonstrates the ability to electrically
stimulate and record nearly complete populations of retinal ganglion cells at single-cell, single-spike
resolution. We will develop the technologies needed to take this approach to the in vivo setting, and then
use them to probe visual function in behaving macaques, by pursuing three aims: (1) develop and test a
high-density, large-scale electrical recording and stimulation device, (2) develop surgical techniques, test
biocompatibility, and test functionality in anesthetized animals, and (3) probe the computations within and
between the M and P pathways and their role in motion vision. Our unique approach to these problems
relies on a team with extensive experience in neurophysiology, visual behavior, integrated circuits,
materials science, surgery, and signal processing. In addition to testing fundamental aspects of visual
function in novel ways, this work will produce a platform technology for other neural interfaces and a
functional prototype for a future retinal implant to treat incurable blindness."
10877964,"The lacrimal gland (LG) produces fluid and proteins essential for ocular surface function. A subset of severe dry
eye disease (DED) cases are associated with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease associated with
exocrinopathy and systemic inflammation. SS-associated DED is characterized by severe LG inflammation
(dacryoadenitis) and reduced tear secretion, with tears containing an altered spectrum of proteins which may
provoke ocular surface inflammation. In the male NOD mouse, a model of ocular symptoms of SS, expression
and activity of cathepsin S (CTSS) is highly increased in LG and in tears in parallel with disease; increased tear
CTSS is also seen in SS patients. Treatment of male NOD mice with a CTSS inhibitor suppressed ocular
symptoms of SS. A complication of the use of CTSS inhibitors reported so far in clinical trials is the induction of
additional CTSS expression, suggesting a feedback loop responsible for the regulation of the expression and
activity of this enzyme which is so critical in inflammatory processes. An alternative to CTSS inhibition for
treatment of ocular symptoms of SS is identification and reversal of processes in the LG driving its: 1)increased
expression; 2) increased tear secretion; and 3)participation in LG inflammation. Three Aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Does dysregulation of PP2A signaling contribute to increased CTSS in LGAC in SS? Protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates CTSS mRNA stability/translation through dephosphorylation of tristetraprolin
(TTP). Mechanisms of dysregulation of PP2A-TTP leading to increased CTSS expression and secretion from
LGAC will be explored in NOD and control mice, and in cultured LG acinar cells (LGAC). The efficacy of the
PP2A activator, DT-061, on LG and ocular surface disease will be determined in NOD and control mice.
Aim 2. Does increased trafficking through the minor secretory pathway promote increased tear CTSS in
SS? Most tear proteins are secreted from the LGAC “major” secretory pathway, but a “minor” pathway from
endolysosomes may contribute CTSS to tears. In Rab deficient mice with altered tear contributions from major
and minor pathways, changes in minor pathway cargo in tears beyond CTSS will be identified. Correlative light
and electron microscopy will identify endolysosomal membranes responsible for minor pathway secretion; these
new measures will be applied to test whether the minor pathway is increased in SS using NOD and control mice.
Aim 3. Does local or systemic modulation of endolysosomal traffic through PIKFYVE inhibition suppress
CTSS-mediated pathology in SS? PIKFYVE is a master regulator of endolysosomal trafficking and maturation,
regulating CTSS function in antigen presentation and expression of IL12/23. The effects of local and systemic
inhibition of PIKFYVE on ocular symptoms of SS will be evaluated in NOD and control mice, in parallel with
additional indicators of LGAC autoimmune epithelitis, tear and exosome abundance, and expression of IL-12/23.
Results from these studies will collectively define changes in secretory pathways that may contribute to ocular
manifestations of SS, while identifying new therapeutic agents yet unexplored in SS to mitigate ocular disease."

PAR-21-174
 Summary / Abstract
To minimize human illnesses and deaths related to the consumption of contaminated produce,
the West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) will continue to implement and enhance
state compliance with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act
(FSMA). The Produce Safety Rule, 21 CFR Part 112, establishes standards for the Growing,
Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption. We propose the WVDA,
in conjunction with West Virginia State University Extension (WVSU) and West Virginia
University (WVU), will work together to integrate and implement a produce safety program for
the state of West Virginia.
The WVDA will follow Program Path B and conduct produce safety inspections under the FDA’s
authority. West Virginia currently does not have sprout growers that are covered, however,
should a grower become covered, WVDA will complete all necessary training and conduct
sprout inspections. The WVDA will complete program objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7. This will
include activities related to the assessment and planning of the program; statewide produce
program administration; education, outreach, and technical assistance; state farm inventory; an
inspectional program; a compliance and enforcement program; and response to produce related
activities.
The WVDA will partner with two agencies to ensure adequate training and outreach may be
provided to growers in West Virginia. The WVDA will provide subawards to WVSU Extension
and WVU Extension which shall provide staff to complete Produce Safety Alliance (PSA)
trainings, a lead trainer for the PSA curriculum, write produce safety related articles for
agricultural publications, and host West Virginia Food Safety Training Team meetings. West
Virginia University Extension will additionally provide staff to complete On Farm Readiness
Reviews (OFRRs) and Writing your Farm Food Safety Plan training courses.
West Virginia has the demonstrated infrastructure and experienced personnel to complete the
objectives outlined in this proposal. The activities will enhance the produce safety program of
the state and support the coordinated efforts toward a national integrated food safety system."
10907564,"Program Description/Abstract
Metabolism is the core process underlying essentially all biological functions. The goal of our research program
is to discover the mechanisms linking the metabolic state of immune cells with tissue homeostasis and
antitumor immunity, and to use these insights for development of better cancer treatments. We approach these
questions by integrating hypothesis-driven and systems immunology approaches, and our work has produced
innovation in three main areas. First, we revealed the principle of metabolic reprogramming for T cell fate, state
and tolerance. Our earlier findings in metabolic control of T cell fate and state, including T cell subset-specific
requirement of Warburg metabolism and mTOR signaling, contributed to the foundation and rapid growth of the
immunometabolism field. More recently, we identified metabolic heterogeneity in vivo that underlies T cell fate
between stemness and terminal differentiation in tumor microenvironment and inflammation, and the cycle of
metabolic quiescence and quiescence exit in immune development and function. Second, we defined
mechanisms of nutrient and immune signaling. We identified how nutrient and autophagic signals serve as
potent regulators of cellular metabolism, and how dendritic cell-derived immune and metabolic signals are
integrated by T cells. Third, we combined the traditional hypothesis-driven or ‘reductionist’ approach with
systems biology principles, including in-house development of network algorithm NetBID, pooled in vivo
CRISPR screening and systems proteomics, which led to the identification of new concepts and ‘hidden
drivers’ in immunometabolism that cannot be surmised from simpler systems. More importantly, these
approaches enabled the discovery of novel immuno-oncology targets with a clear path to clinical translation
into innovative therapeutics for pediatric cancers. Our systems immunology strategies provide functionally-
relevant discovery platforms to support future research in metabolic control of immunity and cancer.
Specifically, the future research program will address three fundamental questions in immunometabolism and
antitumor immunity, by testing the central hypothesis that immunometabolic pathways are inextricably
connected to the mechanisms of adaptive immune responses and antitumor immunity; by understanding these
connections, we gain new targets for the treatment of cancer: 1) How are nutrient signals sensed and
integrated by immune cells? 2) How can immunometabolism be rewired to improve antitumor immunity? 3)
Can we break metabolic barriers to cancer immunity and therapy, especially in therapeutically-resistant
cancers? We will focus on T cells, the cornerstone for cancer immunotherapy, to gain in-depth insights, but we
anticipate the findings can be tested and extended into other immune cells. Our experience in the application
of multidisciplinary approaches, combined with our new development and use of novel preclinical and human
disease systems for cancer immunotherapy, makes us uniquely positioned to produce fundamental discoveries
in immunometabolism and clinical translation for cancer treatments by reprogramming metabolic pathways."
10895442,"Project Summary
Tumor metastasis requires supportive microenvironment for outgrowth of disseminated tumor
cells. The switch of metastatic cells from dormant to proliferative state needs nutrients for
energetics and biomass production. Although metabolic regulation of tumor metastasis is not well-
established, recent studies demonstrated the importance of fatty acid (FA) uptake and metabolism
in tumor cells that drives metastatic tumor outgrowth. However, it is unclear how FA pools in the
tumor microenvironment is regulated. The vascular system plays a crucial role in supplying
nutrients. This application investigates how vascular endothelial cells regulate FA transportation
and utilization in metastatic tumor outgrowth. We discovered that loss of Raptor/mTORC1, but
not Rictor/mTORC2, in vascular endothelium inhibits metastatic tumor outgrowth in lung.
Raptor/mTORC1 deficiency led to reduced long chain fatty acid (LCFA) and polyunsaturated fatty
acid (PUFA) in endothelial cells (EC), decreased expression of membrane proteins that mediate
FA transport, reduced FA uptake and transport across endothelium, and decreased lipid droplets
in metastatic tumors. Based on these preliminary data, we propose a model in which mTORC1
activities in vascular endothelial cells stimulate transendothelial FA transport, leading to enhanced
FA utilization in tumor cells and metastatic outgrowth. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate
downstream mechanisms by which vascular mTORC1 regulates transport of fatty acids across
the endothelium (Aim 1), upper-stream factors that stimulate the FA transport (Aim 2), and
determine if selectively blocking endothelial mTORC1 will suppress metastatic outgrowth and
improve chemo- and immunotherapy against metastasis (Aim 3). The proposed work is innovative
in its concept that mTORC1 regulates tumor blood vessel transportation of fatty acids. It also
utilizes several state-of-the-art technologies, including a metabolomics screen, MALDI-imaging
mass spectrometry for lipid/FA detection on tumor section in situ, a breast cancer PDX model,
and several new conditional mouse models. These studies would set the stage for future
development of strategies selectively targeting endothelial mTORC1 or fatty acid transportation
to improve anti-cancer therapy."
10898037,"Project Summary
Adolescents in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) lose substantial developmental potential from exposure to
early adversities, with an estimated 250 million children at risk of not reaching their developmental potential.
Such catastrophic loss of human potential occurs in the context of the 10/90 divide – 10% of our current scientific
knowledge is produced in or by LMICs that comprise 90% of the world’s population. This skewed evidence base
has led to a limited understanding of patterns of risk and resilience in brain development for the vast majority of
the world’s adolescents. Emotion regulation (ER), the internal and external process that modifies the experience
or expression of an emotion, is a key mediator between early adversity and outcomes, and yet, the lack of data
on ER in youth from most of the world is of concern given evidence that context shapes the socialization of
emotion. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining a) sophisticated
data analytic techniques and b) community-guided/-participatory research applied to longitudinal multimodal
brain imaging, high-dimensional behavioral assessments, and comprehensive defining of environmental
exposures (both adverse and protective) from a well-established and deeply-characterized birth cohort of early
adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa. The goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the
impact of protective factors on neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying ER resilience. The premise is that
early adversities are heterogeneous, powerful events that significantly increase the risk of poor ER, but also that
resilience factors experienced during early adolescence can mitigate/ameliorate these risks. Therefore,
prediction of ER outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-
driven approaches will 1) more precisely define ER behavioral profiles for adolescents living in LMICs who are
exposed to heterogeneous adversities, and 2) provide a robust explanatory model for links between resilience
factors and ER neurobehavioral trajectories. Aim 1 subtypes 525 12-13 year-old adolescents in an established
LMIC birth cohort based on early environmental exposures and then tests for neural correlates of ER behavioral
resilience (based on MRI measures of functional connectivity, task-based activity, and morphometry) accounting
for early adversity subtype. Aim 2 identifies changes in neurobiology that underlie improvements in adolescent
ER and develops an explanatory model to predict 2-year (Time2-Time1) longitudinal ER resilience trajectory
subtypes based on concurrent environmental exposures (protective and adverse), accounting for
early adversity
subtype. The inclusion of participant-sex and pubertal status will identify potential divergence in pathways across
early adolescence. We use a prospective approach together with machine learning methods with the goal of
improving precision and inclusivity in recognizing and characterizing resilience to socio-economic, structural,
health, and interpersonal adversities."
10814321,"Abstract
The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) in the pathogenesis of obesity,
Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Greater than 34 million Americans have
diabetes, and another 88 million are considered pre-diabetic. This is largely attributed to the prevalence of
obesity, with 72% of American adults currently classified as overweight or obese. Among the comorbidities
associated with T2D, over 70% of patients have NAFLD. Epidemiological studies have linked high fructose
consumption with obesity, T2D, and NAFLD. This proposal identifies GLO1 as pro-NAFLD/obesogenic gene.
Using CRISPR-Cas9, we have generated GLO1 knockout mice. When fed a high-fat high sucrose diet, these
mice display significantly blunted weight gain, restored glucose tolerance, and reduced hepatic steatosis
compared to wild-type counterparts. GLO1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that detoxifies the glycolytic by-
product, methylglyoxal (MGO). When GLO1 activity is disrupted, MGO levels increase, resulting in long-lived
protein post-translational modifications. We have shown that MGO serves as a metabolic sensor for nutrient flux,
regulating glycolytic output and transcriptional responses to sugar. Thus, we hypothesize that GLO1 is a pro-
NAFLD/obesogenic gene, reducing MGO and removing the brakes on metabolism. We will test this hypothesis
by addressing the following three Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1 we will quantify the impact of Glo1 on whole-
body energetics and hepatic lipid metabolism using a 16-week chow- or high-fat high-sucrose diet. We will
quantify lean vs. fat mass, energy expenditure, and total activity. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial
respiration will be quantified in primary hepatocytes. Lastly, lipogeneic genes will be assessed using RNA-seq.
In Specific Aim 2 we will determine the impact of Glo1 on intestinal fructose metabolism. The intestine is a
primary site of fructose metabolism. Stable isotope labeling via 13C6-fructose oral gavage will be used to quantify
intestinal, hepatic, muscle, adipose, and circulating fructose metabolites. This approach will quantitatively
determine how Glo1 regulates intestinal carbohydrate metabolism, a previously unexplored area of research.
Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will confirm that MGO-derived histone PTMs regulate transcriptional responses to
metabolism in vivo. Site-specific canonical and MGO-derived PTMs will be quantified in each tissue/cohort.
Putative reader domains will be identified for MG-H1 histone modifications. Lastly, liver, intestine, muscle,
adipose, and pancreas will be subjected to RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. This approach will determine the global
epigenomic landscape across multiple tissues in a physiologically relevant model for obesity, T2D and NAFLD.
Collectively, this proposal will combine mechanistic biochemistry with a multi-omics approach to determine the
mechanisms by which GLO1 propagates disease progression."
10764303,"Project Summary/Abstract
This work focuses on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), globally the most common bacterial cause of
serious diarrheal illness. Originally identified more than 50 years ago as a cause of severe diarrheal illness in
patients with clinical presentations indistinguishable from cholera, ETEC continue to threaten the lives of many
children in poor regions of the world where sanitation and clean water remain limited. While deaths from
diarrheal illness in low-middle income countries have declined, largely due to deployment of oral rehydration
therapy, the tremendous morbidity associated with these illnesses remains completely unchecked. ETEC are
closely linked to a condition known as environmental enteropathy or environmental enteric dysfunction (EED)
that is complicated by sequelae of malnutrition, stunted growth, and intellectual impairment, robbing poor
countries of badly needed human capital. Children with malnutrition are also at tremendously increased risk of
dying from infectious diarrhea, pneumonia, and other common infections. In addition, ETEC have been linked
to a centuries-old enigmatic disease, known as tropical sprue, that is typically diagnosed in adults with
substantial repeated exposure to these pathogens. With EED it shares features of poor nutrient absorption,
wasting, and alterations of small intestinal morphology.
Much is known about of the molecular pathogenesis of acute diarrheal disease, with heat- labile (LT) and heat-
stable (ST) toxins signaling through cAMP and cGMP second messenger pathways, respectively, to alter
enterocyte ion channels that promote the net efflux of salt and water into the intestinal lumen. However, the
biology underlying enteropathic changes to the small intestine and related sequelae are very poorly
understood. Our recent studies indicate that ETEC toxins compromise cellular messages critical to the
maintenance, biogenesis and function of small intestinal surfaces responsible for nutrient absorption.
The current project will therefore address the following questions:
· “What is the impact of ETEC and its individual toxins on the absorptive architecture of small intestine?”
· “How does repeated ETEC infection affect the overall expression of genes that direct formation of
 surfaces needed for nutrient absorption?”
· “Can we mitigate these effects by toxin-neutralizing vaccination?”
Addressing these fundamental questions will fill important gaps in our understanding of the sequelae to ETEC
infections, elucidate important features of the molecular pathogenesis of disease, and inform strategies to
prevent illnesses that threaten millions of disadvantaged children worldwide."

The introduction of multi-gene panel testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome has
rapidly changed the clinical approach to genetic testing for patients and their families. Young breast cancer
survivors (YBCS), diagnosed at age ≤50 years old, may have inherited a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP)
variant in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, etc. Recent studies have found
suboptimal rates of genetic testing among young breast cancer patients with less than 50% completion rates for
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Racial and ethnic disparities in genetic testing
completion and results have been well documented. My long-term career goal is to become a leading
independent investigator in breast cancer prevention and control, focusing on cancer genetics/genomics, risk
communication, biobehavioral oncology, and reduction of cancer health disparities among racial/ethnic minority
women. The specific aims are: In Aim 1, we propose to identify factors associated with completion of HBOC
multigene panel testing, cancer risk-reducing behaviors, and family risk communication among racially/ethnically
diverse young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) (N=300) within a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study.
In addition, we will conduct qualitative interviews with (N=40) YBCS who completed genetic testing and those
who have not completed genetic testing to explore knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about genetic testing, and to
identify barriers and facilitators to the communication of genetic risk to their at-risk relatives. We will illuminate
quantitative findings with qualitative data collected. In Aim 2, we will apply user-centered design to modify the
existing genetic testing module within the RealRisks decision aid to meet the needs of YBCS and to add family
risk communication content and conduct participatory workshops and usability testing (N=20). Lastly, in Aim 3,
we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of standard patient education alone or in combination with the
modified RealRisks decision aid among racially/ethnically diverse YBCS. This career development award will
provide me with protected time and the opportunity to pursue my training goals in several targeted areas: (1):
Acquire and apply advanced statistical analytics for conducting mixed methodology and intervention research;
(2) increase knowledge and skills in biobehavioral oncology, cancer survivorship, clinical application of
genetic/genomic medicine, risk communication in families, cascade genetic testing, adapting web-based
decision support interventions for underserved populations, and breast cancer health disparities; (3) gain didactic
and experiential learning in the conduct of randomized controlled trials; and (4) develop leadership skills in the
ethical conduct of scientific research, grant writing, increasing scholarly productivity, and management skills for
scientific independence. In summary, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote
Diversity will provide me with invaluable experiences to successfully transition into a scientific independence,
ultimately reducing health disparities."
10873845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of genomics research is conducted in populations of European descent, leaving other
groups behind as we rapidly move from genetic discovery to clinical translation, exacerbating existing
health inequities. The transferability of findings is further complicated in admixed populations, those with
recent ancestry from two or more continents, in that there is substantial genetic heterogeneity both
between and within groups. It is therefore necessary to understand these biases in a comprehensive
manner across multiple ancestries, study designs, and traits, to better inform future methodological
developments and biomedical research frameworks. The research program I propose in this
application would use existing individual-level genetic data and published summary statistics to
disentangle the relative contributions of genetics and environment to human health in admixed
populations. This multi-factorial proposal seeks to (1) quantify bias due to admixture on a global and
local ancestry level and (2) deconvolute the interaction between genetic ancestry and environmental
variables when estimating genetic effect sizes. These investigations will occur on both a variant-level and
genome-wide with polygenic risk scores (PRS). Variant-level analyses, such as genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), seek to pinpoint genes and regulatory mechanisms that underlie a particular trait. To
identify biological targets, it is necessary to determine if a lack of transferability is due to population
genetics (allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium) or ancestry-specific gene-by-environment
interactions. PRS sum effects across the genome to estimate the genetic liability of a trait and stratify
individuals by risk. By expanding their scope, PRS often capture the off-target study characteristics,
whether by confounding or true pleiotropy, in turn limiting the portability between populations. These
relationships, both on a variant- and genome-wide level, are further complicated in admixed populations,
with ancestry patterns being correlated with the trait, genetic variants of interest, and the prevalence of
non-genetic variables. The proposed research program will examine these dynamics using both global
admixture proportions and local ancestry haplotypes from individual-level data in well-characterized
cohorts, disentangling of genetic and non-genetic factors in a precise manner, and providing a
comprehensive catalog of ancestry-trait considerations and an admixture-aware framework for the
evaluation of variant- (GWAS) and genome-wide (PRS) genetic effect estimates to the wider research
community. By systematically exploring these relationships, we will better inform future method
development and risk assessment frameworks in parallel with on-going consortia efforts to
increase diverse representation in genomic studies, setting up the next generation of genomic
research to address existing health inequities."
10828857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a devastating cancer with an urgent and unmet need for effective
therapies (median survival: ~28 months). Approximately 30% of CMML cases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) soon after their initial diagnosis, contributing to the poor prognosis of CMML patients. During the prior
funding period, we collaborated with the International MDS/MPN Consortium and demonstrated that concurrent
NRAS and ASXL1 mutations define a population of CMML patients with shorter leukemia-free survival than those
with ASXL1 mutations only. Based on our human data, we characterized NrasG12D/+; Asxl1-/- (NA) mice that model
CMML patients with concurrent NRAS and ASXL1 mutations. NA mice developed CMML with accelerated
progression and in ~50% of these mice CMML transformed to AML (secondary AML, sAML). NA leukemia cells
exhibited hyperactivation of MEK/ERK signaling and increased global level of H3K27Ac, a histone mark bound
by bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins for gene transcriptional activation. Upregulation of
AP-1 transcription factors (TFs) mediated the overexpression of PD-L1 and CD86, two inhibitory immune
checkpoint ligands, and helped establish a suppressive immune microenvironment in NA-sAML recipients.
Combined inhibition of MEK and pan-BET proteins led to downregulation of AP-1 TF expression, partial
mitigation of the suppressive immune microenvironment, enhancement of CD8 T cell cytotoxicity, and prolonged
survival in NA-sAML mice. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Asxl1-/- and oncogenic Nras
cooperate to accelerate CMML and promote its transformation to AML via reprogramming the immune
microenvironment, which includes but may not limit to T cells. Moreover, immunomodulatory agents may further
improve the therapeutic benefits of combine MEK and BET inhibition through establishing durable anti-leukemia
activities in immune cells. In this renewal application, we propose the following two aims to test our hypothesis:
1) To identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of immune microenvironment
in in NA mice; and 2) determine whether immunomodulatory agents further improve the therapeutic effects of
combined MEK and BET inhibition in NA mice. Together, our proposed studies will not only provide fundamental
perspectives on disease mechanisms but also test hypotheses that could potentially lead directly to potent and
efficacious novel therapies for treating CMML and transformed AML."
10932857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease that has a significant impact on public health, with annual
direct and indirect costs over $75 billion dollars in the US. Advancements in high throughput technology have
enabled the identification of genetic and genomic components in the Th17/IL-23 and NF𝜅B axes, associated
with psoriasis pathology. Although >80 psoriasis susceptibility regions have been revealed, considerable
challenges remain in narrowing down the causal genetic variations and discerning their pathological mechanisms
that shape disease etiology. Similarly, while NF𝜅B signaling is involved in psoriasis and different skin immune
disorders, we have very limited understanding of the mechanistic role genetic variants play in NF𝜅B regulation.
With the new extended psoriasis GWAS emerging, psoriasis can serve as an ideal skin disease model to study
this phenomenon in keratinocytes. Psoriasis has a prevalence rate of 1.3% among African Americans (AA),
however most US-established genomics studies of psoriasis have been conducted on European American (EA)
populations. Our preliminary data show that the fine-mapping of components can be facilitated by integrating
genetic, epigenetic, and genomic information in a multi-ethnic analysis design, especially when including
individuals with African ancestry. We have illustrated elevated NF𝜅B signaling response in keratinocytes among
AA individuals and that inter-individual variations in inflammatory signature can have significant clinical
implications for the assessment of drug response. The long-term goal of this project is to identify biological
mechanisms for disease heterogeneity among psoriatic patients, and our overall objective is to utilize a trans-
ethnic design to advance the identification of psoriasis-associated regulatory mechanisms involved in the
modulation of NF𝜅B signaling in keratinocytes. We will apply an integrative approach to study multi-omics data
and leverage trans-ethnic information to fine-map the genetic/genomic components associated with inter-
individual inflammatory responses, providing a model to understand disease disparity among psoriatic patients
of different ethnicities. We will i) fine-map the response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) modulating
NF𝜅B and other inflammatory signaling in keratinocytes; ii) determine regulatory mechanisms of psoriasis signal
that drive NF𝜅B signaling in keratinocytes at the cellular level using multi-modal genomic data; iii) utilize genetic
and genomic components participating in NF𝜅B signaling, to model clinical presentations and outcomes for
patients from an ongoing longitudinal psoriasis cohort. Successful completion of the project will have an
important positive impact by providing enhanced resolution and power to identify determinants of inter-individual
variations in inflammatory responses."
10839930,"Component: CURATION
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Xenbase’s mandate is to curate the data from Xenopus research and generate the definitive
reference dataset for this key model organism. In order to fulfill this mandate, the data in Xenbase
must be accurately annotated, comprehensive, and up-to-date. Xenbase contains many different
data types (genomes and genes, orthology, RNA, proteins, genomic data (RNA/ChIP-seq), gene
expression, gene function, anatomy, reagents (MOs and antibodies), mutant and transgenic lines,
phenotypes and disease associations) that data come from published literature, direct community
submissions and from other. We curate, annotate and index data types using ontologies (i.e.,
standardized vocabularies), which make the data computer readable and FAIR compliant. This
allows us to inter-relate different data types within Xenbase and to link Xenopus data to humans
and other model organisms. Our literature module contains >52,000 Xenopus research papers.
We have curated ~4,800 of these primarily for gene expression patterns, transgenic lines and
reagents, yet we estimate that about 10,000 additional papers contain valuable data, including
phenotypes and GO, two of our main curation priorities in this renewal. Another major goal is to
curate the metadata associated with Xenopus RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets in the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) so that we can process the data and make it available on Xenbase.
Our plan to support single cell transcriptomics will be a third major curation effort in this renewal.
In order to manage this volume of new data, our curation workflow implements several innovative
semi-automated pipelines, texting mining and machine learning. Our curation goals are to stay
current with new publications, clear the backlog of to-be-curated papers (giving priority to those
with phenotypes/models of human disease), and add additional data types, including diverse omic
data sets.
Aim 1. Continue curation of Xenopus research data.
Aim 2. Curate Xenopus phenotypes and human disease models.
Aim 3. Curate new omics and cell biological data."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Technology Development component describes software development for Xenbase. This
includes code in the database, web applications, user and curator interfaces. New data types and
new curation efforts require new systems, tools and software interfaces to be built. Importantly,
interfaces must be designed to allow our community members to browse and interrogate the data
via our web portal. We have recently added many new content types to Xenbase, including RNA-
seq and ChIP-seq data from GEO, and anatomical and expression phenotypes; and there are
many additional types of content that will require support from technology development team,
including single-cell omics, clustering tools for omics visualization, tolls to visualize human
disease variants and Xenopus phenotypes. As many of the biologists generating and accessing
these data are not bioinformaticians, we need to develop tools and interfaces that are intuitive
and easy to use. An excellent example of how we achieved this is our recently released GEO
module that allows non-experts to view, interact with, and understand RNA-seq data through a
simple, intuitive and interactive web interface. Over the next five years, we will proceed through
numerous steps for each new to type of data we aim to support: assessing data requirements,
data modeling, middleware software development, testing and optimization of trial releases,
develop curator, user and data browsing interfaces. Prioritization of projects is done in
consultation with the Xenopus research community via annual surveys and workshops at
conferences, input from our external advisory board and collaborators, and, in the future, in
consultation with the Alliance of Genome Resources (AGR) workgroups. Planned new projects
include ATAC-seq data from GEO, orthology data from DIOPT, single-cell RNA-seq, support for
human disease variants and single-cell omics. Technology Development will also support our
increased use of machine learning as applied to Xenopus literature curation.
Aim 1: Support expanded and novel content.
Aim 2: Generate custom content and support variants and single-cell datasets via external
resources.
Aim 3: Interface with external resources."
10809017,"Project Summary/Abstract
Transient receptor potential vanilloid, member 4 (TRPV4) is a cation channel highly expressed in cardiomyocytes
with aging, and contributes to enhanced cardiomyocyte calcium cycling and hypercontractility following TRPV4
gating stimuli including osmotic stress and mechanical stretch. Excessive TRPV4 activation leads to cardiac
damage and ventricular arrhythmia. Angiotensin II (AngII) is a peptide hormone critically important to
cardiovascular physiology and pathology due to its regulatory effects on blood volume and pressure. In many
cell types, AngII increases TRPV4 activity although the contribution of this signaling axis to cardiomyocyte
calcium homeostasis is currently unknown. This renewal proposal tests the central hypothesis that TRPV4
contributes to AngII-dependent cardiomyocyte calcium signaling and ventricular arrhythmia. To test this
hypothesis, we will use both a pharmacologic (TRPV4 inhibition) and genetic approach (cardiomyocyte specific
TRPV4 deletion or overexpression) to examine the functional role of TRPV4 in isolated cardiomyocytes, in
isolated perfused hearts, and in mice in vivo. Specific Aim 1 uses isolated cardiomyocytes and isolated perfused
hearts to test the hypothesis that AngII promotes TRPV4 trafficking, increases TRPV4 activity, and enhances
cardiomyocyte calcium transients during excitation-contraction coupling. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that
cardiomyocyte TRPV4 contributes to AngII-induced cardiac remodeling, and examines the role of TRPV4 in
hypertrophic and fibrotic remodeling following AngII excess (osmotic mini-pumps) and during biological aging.
Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that TRPV4 contributes to pro-arrhythmic cardiomyocyte calcium signals and
ventricular arrhythmia following both acute and chronic AngII excess. The overall goal of this project is to
establish TRPV4 as a therapeutic target to prevent arrhythmia with aging."
10904746,"Machine Learning Prediction of 1-Year Mortality and Recurrence after Ischemic Stroke Using
 Enriched EHR data
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It has been estimated that the 1-year risk of
death and recurrence after a stroke is around 15% and 10%, respectively. Furthermore, a recent report from the
Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) has shown a substantial increase in the annual number of strokes and
secondary deaths, especially in low-income groups. Recurrent strokes, with an increasing trend, have a higher
rate of death and disability. Thus, it is imperative to identify at-risk patients for recurrence and death for proper
and timely evaluation, resource allocation, and targeted prevention. The investigators’ recently published review
indicates that ─the multiple clinical scores developed for predicting stroke recurrence have only limited clinical
utility. Similarly, current stroke prognostic models vary widely in quality; prediction models of post-stroke mortality
are limited by their validation cohort size, breadth of clinical variables, and overall usefulness. The investigators
have recently developed machine learning-based models of post-stroke all-cause mortality and recurrence using
electronic health records (EHR) data. Despite promising results, our current pilot predictive models are limited
to a single health system and may have inadequate generalizability due to implicit bias.
This proposal seeks to expand and improve predictive models through the creative use of vetted EHR data
for ischemic stroke patients from three large and different health systems (Penn State Health, Geisinger, and
Johns Hopkins), caring for more than eight million people in rural and urban areas. This project will further explore
the predictive value of social determinants of health (SDoH) when added to the clinical data. The investigators
propose an integrative approach to design parameter-optimized and interpretable models, leveraging enriched
EHR to identify the risk of ischemic stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality. Aim 1: Standardize EHR-based
data across health care centers to identify clusters of ischemic stroke patients with common traits. Aim
2: Develop optimal interpretable ensemble models to predict 1-year mortality and recurrence after an ischemic
stroke. Aim 3: Validate, prospectively and externally, ensemble models for 1-year mortality and stroke
recurrence.
 This proposal includes model development with internal, external, and temporal validation and lays the
foundation for an impact study to provide evidence of clinical utility. The investigators envision that this study will
lead to EHR-based screening tools that can flag high-risk stroke patients for more targeted secondary prevention."
10885115,"Project Abstract
Surgery is often indicated when asymptomatic gallstone disease, with a prevalence as high as 20% in the US
population, becomes symptomatic; this occurs when gallstones block the digestive drainage of the gallbladder,
pancreas, liver, or intestine. Cholecystectomy, occurring in a million people in the US annually, is the surgical
removal of the gallbladder to treat this diagnosed symptomatic gallstone disease (dSGD). Whether patients have
a more morbid and costly emergency rather than a non-emergency cholecystectomy, may depend on many
factors which are largely unknown. However, since emergency cholecystectomy has been suggested to possibly
have 5 to 10x the mortality elective cholecystectomy has, if gallstone disease could be avoided completely via
high-quality prevention and non-surgical therapy, or when surgery is indicated it could be elective rather than an
emergency, overall mortality from this extremely common condition might be reduced. The objective of this K23
is to start population-based research on disease requiring emergency surgery, currently representing over two-
thirds of healthcare delivery in US hospitals and alarmingly over half of total mortality and cost. This will begin
with a study of the frequency of, and mortality from, emergency cholecystectomy, informed by the overall
population experience with dSGD. The main hypothesis of this study is emergency has higher mortality than
non-emergency cholecystectomy; if the natural history of dSGD were shifted from emergency to non-emergency
cholecystectomy this leads to a decrease in the overall mortality rate with dSGD. The goal this program of
research begins will be to provide population-based data to decrease less safe emergency surgery, moving
toward safer non-emergency surgery or non-surgical care, decreasing the overall US mortality of dSGD in the
process. The proposed study fits well with the candidate’s career development goals and 4-year training and
mentoring program to evolve into an independent clinical epidemiologist studying digestive diseases requiring
emergency surgery. The candidate is pivoting from a primarily clinical career to a research career. He has strong
experience in emergency surgery and public health, and seeks training in rigorous clinical epidemiology methods,
claims data research, deeper biostatistical expertise, new skills to collaborate on mixed-methods patient-oriented
research, and a mentored transition to designing new etiologic studies of his own. The mentorship team consists
of recognized experts in clinical epidemiology research and training, gallstone epidemiology, inferential
biostatistics, prevention and qualitative methods, and emergency surgery, who will oversee the execution of the
training and career development plan. Research and training will occur at Rutgers, which is a ripe environment
for fostering this junior investigator through a transition to research independence. At the conclusion of this
project, the candidate will have documented the natural epidemiology and the overall mortality of dSGD in the
US, and how this may or may not have changed in response to increasing health insurance. This will inform the
candidate’s design of future etiologic (R01) studies to understand and eventually to reduce mortality from dSGD."
10832104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. While alcohol remains the most widely endorsed substance during
adolescence, and various psychosocial risk factors have been identified, unknown are the potential origins for
how disparities in alcohol related problems emerge among young adults among Hispanic/Latina/x/o
populations. Applying a health disparities approach to youth alcohol use (AU) prevention research is necessary
to identify high impact points of intervention during adolescence before AU related problems emerge in
adulthood. Given that health disparities are attributable to compounded exposure to adversity beginning in
childhood, investigating relationships between the social determinants of health (SDoH) and AU and related
problems in adolescence is critical. We will consider both the risk and protective role of socio-cultural factors
(e.g., discrimination vs. familism) for AU and mental health during adolescence using the ecodevelopmental
framework, with a focus on Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth. Further, understanding SDoH (e.g., school and
neighborhood features) associations with AU and related problems will guide policy to identify upstream
determinants that can be intervention targets to bring systemic change that reduces health disparities. This
proposal will leverage the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development® (ABCD) Study, a large comprehensive
dataset, to advance critical areas of research in AU prevention with a focus on Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth and
intersecting identities (e.g., gender and generational status). A quantitative analysis will test (1) socio-cultural
determinants of AU related problems and mental health, and (2) AU influences on mental (anxiety/depression)
in association with cognitive and school performance in Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth. This proposal will use ABCD
study longitudinal data to identify promotive socio-cultural factors (i.e., high familism and low discrimination)
that may buffer risk for AU and related problems influenced by both risk from individual and broader social-
cultural contexts (i.e., school and neighborhood). Potential co-emerging disparities in mental health among
youth will be investigated, and whether mental health (i.e., anxiety/depression) outcomes moderate (i.e.,
exacerbates) the influence of AU on adolescent cognitive functioning. This proposal will then extend the
application of the SDoH framework with community-engaged research approach to conduct a qualitative study
with focus groups with Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth and parents and obtain a response to the ABCD study
quantitative findings to identify research gaps and priorities for AU related problems in the Hispanic/Latina/x/o
community. Findings will inform hypotheses on future AU prevention research using community-engaged
approaches with Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth in a future R01. In summary, the quantitative and qualitative studies
proposed will investigate the socio-cultural determinants of potential co-emerging disparities in alcohol use and
mental health and subsequent impact on cognitive development, with a focus on Hispanic/Latina/x/o youth.
Findings will inform future interventions on AU prevention on timing and the interplay of socio-cultural contexts."
10871883,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The primary aim of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to
provide the candidate (Dr. Delisa Brown) the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to
become an independent investigator focused on alcohol use disorder (AUD) and health disparities. Race-related
stress (RRS) is common among African Americans (AA) in the U.S. and is associated with increased risk of
developing AUD. Research suggests that salient cultural factors, such as positive racial identity, may help
mitigate the negative effects of RRS. However, little research has focused on RRS and AUD, and culturally
sensitive, evidence-based treatments for AUD among AA populations are lacking. Given the dearth of scientific
information available on the effects of RRS among AA individuals with AUD, the proposed study will employ a
well-controlled human laboratory paradigm to identify the subjective (craving, stress), physiological (heart rate,
galvanic skin conductance), and neuroendocrine (cortisol) reactivity to personalized imagery cues (i.e., RRS,
alcohol, and neutral) among AA individuals (N = 60) with AUD. The relationship between racial identity and
reactivity to RRS cues will be examined to further inform the science in this highly understudied area, and support
the future development of culturally sensitive treatments for AA and other minoritized populations with AUD.
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be used to obtain real-time information on alcohol craving, affect,
and drinking patterns following exposure to RRS. The data obtained from this project will provide new knowledge
and insights to inform our understanding of the link between RRS and AUD in ways not previously possible. The
candidate has assembled a mentorship team of experienced and nationally renowned investigators with a history
of collaboration who bring expertise in AUD, health disparities, human laboratory paradigms, EMA, clinical trials,
and treatment development. On-site mentors and consultants include Drs. Sudie Back, Colleen Halliday, and
Erin McClure at MUSC. Off-site mentors and consultants include Dr. Kathleen Burlew at the University of
Cincinnati and Dr. Rajita Sinha at Yale University. The proposed project will provide the mentorship, formal
coursework, hands-on data collection, and career development opportunities needed to ensure the candidate
achieves the following career goals: 1) enhance knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of AUD among
African Americans experiencing RRS, 2) develop new skills to inform cultural adaptions of treatments for AUD,
3) increase competence in conducting alcohol research with racial/ethnic minorities, 4) obtain new training in
EMA methods and data analysis, and 5) increase scholarly productivity through manuscript writing, conference
presentations, and grant writing. This project aligns closely with NIAAA’s Minority Health and Health Disparities
Initiative to eliminate health disparities and increase the number of well-trained scientists from underrepresented
backgrounds in the field of alcohol research."

than ever after two and a half years navigating a global pandemic, and growing mental health
and environmental health crises. This proposal from PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs
(SRL), a teen-driven program from the nation’s most trusted news source, builds from the
successes of previous SEPA work to provide high school youth with: 1.) tools to create
evidence-based and ethically responsible journalism (primarily 1-4 minute videos) about critical
health issues that impact their communities; 2.) introductions and inroads to health science
careers that use storytelling to engage a diverse range of students; and 3.) strategies for
effective communication around health science, including intergenerational dialogue and social
media best-practices, for the general public. The initiative will provide a strong foundation of
support for teens, educators, and other SEPA program leaders to produce high-quality content
distributed to peers through an extensive student journalism network, online learning platforms,
and traditional and digital broadcasting. A previous SEPA summative evaluation largely serves
as the front-end evaluation for this proposed project. Researchers at Knology will use Year 1 to
update all evaluation instruments and create a mixed-methods evaluation with students and
educators in years 2-4 of the grant for both formative and summative purposes. Findings will
measure the impact on programs and participants, including other SEPA projects, and result in
a map of the full ecosystem of health learning opportunities created during the grant period and
their effectiveness, including student-created stories, health practitioner profiles, lesson plans
and other learning opportunities. Student-produced videos will be supplemented with expertly-
crafted educational resources distributed to a wide national audience of teachers, formal and
informal educators, and STEM program leaders. Through these elements – student health
journalism, health science career content, and storytelling strategies for science communication
– the project will drive engagement and understanding around health science and public health
in young people to support an informed, inquisitive, and involved citizenry."
10667310,"Abstract
Following an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, females have worse outcomes; however,
skeletal muscle biology and function have preferentially been studied in males. These observations suggest
that there are sex-based differences in the biological mechanisms contributing to recovery of muscle function.
Intriguing pilot data in this proposal show preferential impairment in the recovery of quadriceps muscle and
function and diminished psychosocial recovery in females as compared to males following ACL reconstruction.
This proposal seeks to test the novel hypothesis that following an ACL injury, females experience exaggerated
muscle cellular and molecular deficits, hindering their recovery of strength, resulting in pronounced deficiencies
in gait mechanics and disproportionally worse psychosocial recovery compared to males. By identifying the
cellular and molecular foundation of sex-based differences, subsequent clinical trials can test sex specific
approaches to improve outcomes for women after ACL injury. We will in Aim 1 define the molecular, cellular
and morphological sex-based differences in quadriceps muscle after ACL injury and reconstruction. In Aim 2
determine the effect of sex on knee function after an ACL reconstruction. Lastly, in Aim 3 will determine the
timing and magnitude of psychosocial recovery differences between females and males following an ACL
reconstruction. Results from this work will exert an immediate impact on clinical practice guidelines, as well as
identify critical therapeutic targets needed to propel subsequent evidence-based clinical trials designed to
improve rehabilitative outcomes for females."

grades 2 to 8. Students will visit with 10 different STEAM scientists over the course of their
learning and grow their science skills and career awareness with the protagonists of their
storyboards. These will be performed in both school based and after school program,
supplemented with meeting the STEAM scientists, field trips and recommendations for
additional informal science activities.
SPECIFIC AIMS
The SCI-ENCE program aims to accomplish the following goals:

career storyboards using age-appropriate presentation materials and activities that increase
fascination with science in 60% of involved students.
2) Implement the curriculum with over 1,000 students in schools and after school community
programs using hands-on, age-appropriate research, activities and experiments that will
result in increased confidence or interest in STEAM careers in 60% of participants over the
course of the grant.
3) Develop a website with free access to all educational materials, instructions, and a facilitator
guide to be used for training educators and eventually serving as a platform for mentoring
these educators to train other individuals.
4) Provide teacher training and classroom support for science training to 100 teachers over the
 grant period through face to face and distance training, videos and a public website that will
 result in 50% of teachers increasing confidence in their science teaching skills.
The Science Career Inquiry - Exploring Native Cultural Examples (SCI-ENCE) Program will
provide services to disadvantaged students from across the State of Hawai'i and the US
Affiliated Pacific jurisdiction of Federated States of Micronesia. There will be be over 1,000
elementary and intermediate/middle school students (ages 7-12) from charter and Hawaiian
language immersion schools, private schools, and community programs in Hawai'i and public
schools in Pohnpei, FSM. Through this curriculum, elementary and middle/intermediate school
youth will gain greater understanding of
STEAM fields and the concepts of scientific research.
Youth will get to know the 10 featured scientists early in elementary school, and return to further
explore science with them during each year of school. Through this process, students will gain
the confidence and excitement to pursue careers in these fields, consequently building a diverse
science
workforce in the State and surrounding Pacific region."
10870057,"Project Summary/Abstract. Between 3-5% of adults harbor an intracranial aneurysm1, and subarachnoid
hemorrhages (SAH) resulting from ruptured aneurysms are associated with a mortality rate of 10-25% with an
additional 30% of patients suffering permanent disability2. Inflammation plays a central role, driving the morbidity
associated with SAH. Despite understanding the important role of inflammation in morbidity following SAH, the
current barrier is that there is no effective methodology to modulate the deleterious inflammatory response in
patients following SAH. Due to this gap, there is a critical need for a novel approach to immunomodulation that
can be safely, rapidly, and effectively deployed in SAH patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) provides a novel,
non-pharmacologic approach to immunomodulation. Studies have demonstrated VNS to reduce systemic
inflammatory markers3 and VNS has had early success treating inflammatory conditions such as arthritis4,
sepsis5, and inflammatory bowel diseases6,7. Our long-term goal is to translate the use of non-invasive
transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes in patients following
spontaneous SAH. The overall objectives for this application in pursuit of achieving this goal are to (i)
demonstrate the impact taVNS has on a key inflammatory marker in the blood and CSF in patients following
SAH, and (ii) determine if taVNS reduces the incidence of inflammation-mediated sequelae of SAH by performing
a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Our central hypothesis is that implementing taVNS in the acute period
following spontaneous SAH will attenuate the expected inflammatory response to hemorrhage and will curtail
morbidity associated with inflammatory-mediated clinical endpoints (i.e., vasospasm, hydrocephalus). Our
hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary findings where our team applied taVNS in a cohort of SAH
patients leading to reductions in white blood cell count, TNF- α, and IL-6 in the CSF, as well as early evidence
of decreased vasospasm and chronic hydrocephalus. Guided by this preliminary data, we will test our central
hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Define the impact that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve
stimulation has on a key subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced inflammatory marker, TNF-α, in the serum and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 2) Determine that taVNS following SAH reduces angiographic vasospasm, and 3)
Determine that taVNS following SAH reduces chronic hydrocephalus. We will perform a randomized controlled
study on aneurysmal SAH patients where we will test whether twice daily treatment with taVNS compared to
sham will alter these physiologic and clinical endpoints. This project is innovative because it diverges from the
pharmacologic status quo by harnessing a novel non-invasive neuromodulatory approach and its known anti-
inflammatory effects to alter the pathophysiology of SAH. The development of a new and effective intervention
in SAH will be significant because this work will create the foundation of knowledge for advancing non-invasive
taVNS to reduce the societal and personal burden of post-SAH morbidity."

The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) is a neuronally diverse and highly interconnected nucleus
within the basal ganglia. Under conditions of low dopamine, plasticity in the GPe promotes the emergence of
pathological firing patterns that contribute to widespread basal ganglia dysfunction. In Parkinson’s disease (PD),
deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the GPe can alleviate motor symptoms, suggesting there is a mechanistic link
between neuronal dysfunction in the GPe and motor symptoms of PD. Using optogenetics to target neuronal
subpopulations in the GPe, we discovered that persistent behavioral rescue could be induced by interventions
that excited parvalbumin-expressing GPe neurons (PV-GPe) and inhibited Lim homeobox 6-expressing GPe
neurons (Lhhx6-GPe). Differences in the synaptic inputs onto these neuronal subpopulations enabled us to
develop a human-translatable electrical DBS protocol that could achieve the same cell-type specificity of
optogenetics. In parkinsonian mice, these circuit-inspired burst DBS protocols provided superior therapeutic
benefit over conventional protocols, extending the therapeutic duration for hours beyond the period of active
stimulation. We are now collaborating with neurosurgeons at Allegheny General in Pittsburgh to test the
therapeutic efficacy of circuit-inspired DBS protocols in humans. Results from in vivo physiological recordings
revealed that GPe interventions reverse parkinsonian pathophysiology in the basal ganglia for hours following
stimulation, raising the intriguing possibility that GPe interventions induce therapeutic plasticity that restores
circuit function in disease. This would represent a transformative advance in PD therapeutics. But a number of
questions still remain about how transient interventions in the GPe translate into long-lasting therapeutic effects
at the behavioral level. This proposal will use electrophysiological, optogenetic, and behavioral approaches to
identify the therapeutic mechanisms of persistent behavioral rescue by achieving three main goals: (1) We will
map the neural pathways required for persistent behavioral rescue, including testing an innovative hypothesis
that both motor and arousal circuits are involved (2) We will identify short-term and long-term effects of GPe
interventions on basal ganglia physiology, testing the hypothesis that GPe interventions drive therapeutic
plasticity in dopamine depleted mice, and (3) We will assess the therapeutic efficacy of GPe interventions
delivered at different stages of dopamine depletion on both motor and non-motor symptoms to further study the
neural circuits involved, as well as to advance preclinical testing of GPe interventions for continued therapeutic
development. These studies will advance the development of circuit-inspired approaches that repair, rather than
mask circuit dysfunction for long-term recovery of brain function in disease."

over a series of Saturday workshops (CHANGE Academies) for students in schools that primarily
serve Black and African American students in the Houston area. Additionally, locally and
nationally, CHANGE will broadly disseminate these lessons through in-person and virtual
professional developments (Health Disparities Institute for Teachers) for educators. The specific
aims of this collaboration are to (i) increase teacher knowledge of both cancer biology and cancer
health disparities and (ii) produce a novel high school biology curriculum on cancer biology and
health disparities research grounded in the Transformative Leadership framework, and (iii) assess
the impact of the CHANGE curriculum on student outcomes. The team that we have assembled
includes the highest caliber of NIH-funded researchers, leaders in STEM teacher Professional
Development (PD), experienced curriculum writers, leading bioethicists, and social scientists with
expertise in racial disparities and inequities and large, diverse school districts. The PI and the
research team have a track record of providing teacher PD that enhances and improves teachers'
science content knowledge, self-efficacy, and leadership, improving student outcomes. Rice
University is an ideal location for this project because it is strategically located in the large and
diverse city of Houston, Texas, and is adjacent to the Texas Medical Center (TMC), the largest
medical complex in the world. These collaborations routinely occur between the TMC and Rice

10834236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke affects over 15 million people worldwide each year and remains the leading cause of disability in the
United States. The economic burden of stroke is increasing as the population ages, making the prevention and
treatment of vascular disease a critical public health issue. Elderly women are a third more likely to develop post-
stroke depression, have greater rates of post-stroke cognitive decline, and have poorer quality of life after stroke
compared to age-matched men. Many biological factors contribute to these disparities, including social factors,
intrinsic sex differences in cell death, and chromosomal sex. As neonates, male mice (and boys) are more
sensitive to ischemia. However, with aging, female mice (and women) have worse outcomes, in part due to loss
of estrogen with reproductive senescence. We have found that genes on the X chromosome that escape
inactivation contribute to significant sex differences in the inflammatory response, both in the brain (microglia)
and in the periphery. We have extended our work to examine sex differences in adipose tissue, in the gut (and
its microbiome), and in the cerebral vasculature. My research focuses on elucidating the fundamental
mechanisms responsible for sex and age differences in cell death, inflammatory responses, and neural repair
throughout the lifespan. The goal of my program is to translate these findings into novel, targeted therapies for
use in patients of both sexes.
Over the past 20 years, our NINDS-funded research program has pioneered work that has improved our
understanding of how sex contributes to cell death. We have a particular emphasis on cerebrovascular diseases,
and have developed programs investigating neonatal injury, vascular dementia, and stroke. Our studies have
revealed that sex differences contribute to the response to brain injury, and in the efficacy of a variety of
neuroprotective agents. The growing recognition that sex is a critical biological variable has led to changes in
NIH policy, which now mandates inclusion of females in pre-clinical studies. Sex differences have also been
identified in the clinical setting. Recognition of these factors has led to sex disaggregation of clinical trial
outcomes and an improved understanding of factors that contribute to low enrollment of women in trials. In this
application, we will consolidate three ongoing NINDS-funded proposals that focus on 1.) age-related
inflammation, 2.) the chromosomal contribution to stroke, and 3.) the detrimental effects of social isolation. We
will leverage our existing knowledge to produce new research that challenges the existing paradigm by
integrating information across these areas. Our research protocol will build on our past successes using cutting-
edge neurophysiological, immunological, and behavioral tools. Successful completion of this research will
increase our understanding of sex in other neurological disorders. My long-term goal is to maximize outcomes
for all patients affected by neurological disease."
10914877,"SUMMARY
Corneal scarring (or fibrosis) is known to cause visual impairment in moderate to severe wounds, and with no
single effective therapy for either the prevention or treatment, the need for new tools to treat and reduce the
risk of scarring is urgent. Cell-cell communication is a vital component for the cornea that encompasses
homeostasis, regeneration, and fibrosis. We have shown that the wound-healing mechanisms of corneal
epithelial cells are comprised in their secretome, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) being a key vector. During
EV production, the EVs selectively engulf a part of their parental cell and become enriched in a repertoire of
bioactive cargo (e.g., proteins, lipids, and RNAs). We recently reported that human corneal fibroblasts (hCF)
treated by TGF-β1 increased expression of fibrotic markers that established a fibrotic matrix, unlike TGF-β3
(anti-fibrotic). Also, our data suggests that EVs derived from human corneal epithelial cells (hCE-EV) can
trigger hCF differentiation, and the proteome of hCE-EV containing TGF-β1 or -β3 could be a driving
mechanism that could contribute to the mechanistic action of corneal scar formation. Although, despite the
wound-healing and corneal stromal activation capacity of hCE-EVs, our understanding of their bioactive
properties and molecular mechanisms for such effects remains unclear. In this proposal, we hypothesize that
the EV subsets, hCE (TGF-β1KD/-β3KD)-EVs, will trigger corneal myofibroblast differentiation to generate an
activated stromal microenvironment that supports fibrotic healing. We propose the following Aims to test this
hypothesis: Aim 1) Modulate and characterize hCE-EV subsets; Aim 2) Define stromal activation capacity of
hCE-EV subsets in 2D and 3D models in vitro; and Aim 3) Determine how hCE-EV subsets effect corneal
scarring in vivo. Relevance to Public Health—Collectively, this proposal will provide important insight for hCE-
EV biology and corneal fibroblast-target cell interaction, which can be leveraged to develop novel EV-based
therapies for the prevention and treatment of corneal scarring."
10809669,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rates of suicide and suicidal ideation and behaviors (SIB) among Black youth have increased drastically in
the past decade, with the rate of suicide rising from 2.55 per 100,000 to 4.82 per 100,000 from 2007 to 2017.
As compared to their White counterparts, the risk of suicide for Black youth under 13 years old has doubled in
the same time period. The overarching goals of this study are to improve our understanding of the uniqueness
and complex etiology of Black youth suicide and SIB through a multi-dimensional approach and to provide
valuable information for future policies targeting suicide reduction among the Black youth population. To do so,
I will first identify risk and protective factors for Black youth (aged 10-24 years) suicide and SIB by jointly
considering individuals’ medical history, neighborhood-level social integration level, and the geographic
distributions of neighborhoods and suicide rates. A large electronic health records (EHR) database from
multiple healthcare systems across New York City (NYC) will be used so that I can gather enough cases of
Black youth suicide and SIB along with their clinical data. Secondly, more culturally sensitive theories are
needed to explain the underlying mechanism driving Black youth suicide and SIB. Suicide and SIB tend to
cluster in geographic space. Prior research using US county-level mortality data has found that the geographic
clustering of suicide rates is affected by both social integration and imitation. Durkheim's social integration
theory suggests that the more socially integrated a person is, the less likely one is to end his/her life. Tarde’s
imitation theory explains suicide as a result of humans adopting the beliefs and behaviors of others in
neighboring areas, suggesting suicide as a contagion. Both the social integration and imitation theories have
been tested on the general youth population as well as the aboriginal and Inuit youth population. However,
whether they can explain contemporary Black youth suicide and SIB is yet to be evaluated. I will develop a
composite measure to quantify neighborhoods’ social integration level, which will be used to evaluate the
social integration theory along with the imitation theory on the Black youth population. Finally, the
counterfactual effects of these social factors on Black youth suicide and SIB risk reduction will also be
evaluated. The proposed study addresses an important public health crisis and the completion of the study will
inform the design of social and clinical policies that have greater efficiency in reducing the rates of Black youth
suicide and SIB. Given the array of new competencies and the multidisciplinary nature of the proposed work,
this K99/R00 award is a necessary step to achieve the candidate’s career goal of leading an interdisciplinary
team committed to closing the gaps of youth mental health disparities."
10839288,"Our PPG renewal is driven by the fundamental and therapeutic importance of PD-1 and TIGIT in regulating T
cell tolerance and T cell dysfunction in cancer and autoimmunity and builds on significant progress we have
made in our previous grant cycle. Our productivity is highlighted by 43 primary publications and 27 reviews.
Working together, we previously demonstrated that PD-1:PD-L1 interactions regulate T cell tolerance while TIGIT
has T cell intrinsic inhibitory effects that mediate Treg function. Based on new preliminary data showing PD-1
deletion increases the frequency of TIGIT+ Tregs and TIGIT agonist reversed in vitro defects of Treg function in
MS, we examined if TIGIT agonism could control pathogenic T cells and ameliorate autoimmunity exacerbated
by PD-1 blockade using the EAE model. Remarkably, TIGIT agonist diminished EAE severity in mice given anti-
PD-1 blocking mAb while not impairing PD-1 efficacy in controlling tumors. Thus, TIGIT is a potential target for
treating immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with PD-1 blockade therapy. We also found that both
PD-L1 and CD155 are upregulated in CNS myeloid cells in states of chronic neurological inflammation and the
TIGIT expressed on Tregs promotes oncogenesis and immune evasion by directly signaling via its ligand CD155
expressed on tumor cells. These discoveries demonstrate ongoing synergy within our PPG with sharing of
unpublished data that have inspired the hypotheses and experiments which drive the focus of this application.
The hypothesis underlying this PPG is that bi-directional signaling through TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-
L1 balance Treg and T effector function and regulate tissue inflammation in autoimmunity and cancer.
Our PPG will consist of three highly integrated and interactive Projects, supported by three Cores. Project 1 will
elucidate bidirectional interactions between TIGIT and CD155 in autoimmunity and cancer. Project 2 will
determine cellular and molecular underpinnings of TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions that regulate Treg
and CD4+Foxp3– function. Project 3 will investigate the roles of TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 in regulating
human CNS inflammation and cancer. Core A (Hafler) will provide administrative and scientific coordination,
Core B (Sharpe/Kuchroo) will provide novel mouse strains and gene perturbation technologies, and Core C
(Zhang/Fan) will provide spatial multi-omics and data integration of all three projects. Our major goals are to: 1)
deeply examine the TIGIT/CD226-CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways in autoimmunity in relationship to their
opposing roles in cancer; 2) identify the cellular and molecular circuits underlying interactions between the
TIGIT/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways to regulate Treg and T effector cell function; 3) determine how reverse
signaling of CD155/PD-L1 alone or in combination into myeloid cells and tumors regulates their function; 4)
develop novel strategies for treating autoimmunity and irAEs. These Projects exemplify fundamental concepts
of a PPG as all projects are interdependent and critical to the success of one another enabling design of new
therapeutic strategies for autoimmunity and irAEs."
10879036,"In 2013, we launched our Training Program in Stem Cell Translational Medicine for Neurological Disorders
(“training program”) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) with the premise that such training is essential
if stem cells are to be used successfully to treat neurological disorders. Nine years later, we believe that this
premise is even more true, as many more academic groups and biotechnology companies explore the potential
of stem cells to directly treat, or lead to treatments for, human disease and injury. Three main area of translational
research are being conducted: the use of stem cells or their derivatives for transplantation to replace those cells
damaged or destroyed by injury, the use of stem cells, including patient derived cells, to study disease processes
and mechanisms, and the use of differentiated products of stem cells to screen for drugs that could alleviate
disease or damage. In recent years the addition of CRISPR-mediated gene editing and the development of “brain
organoids” have added new tools to the arsenal of researchers in the field. For the promise of stem cell
treatments to become a reality, not only must basic research advance in this rapidly evolving field, but these
advances must also be translated through preclinical and clinical development into clinical practice. Translational
approaches must be taught directly. The goal of this renewal is to provide an even better environment to train a
new generation of scientists in the translational application of stem cell biology to neuroscience. Building upon
key successes and feedback from the trainees over the course of this T32 since its inception, our updated
program will even better serve this purpose and includes (1) state-of-the-art rigorous and reproducible wet lab
science employing training in the fundamental principles of rigor and reproducibility, as well as quantitative and
statistical methods; (2) clinical experiences to understand and plan research efforts in the context of clinical
translation; (3) knowledge regarding practical aspects of moving discoveries to clinical trials and therapies
through industry internships and Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center resources; (4) communication,
StrengthsFinder and personal interaction skills; (5) Familiarity with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval processes for clinical trials; and (6) an increased commitment to promoting diversity, equity and
inclusion (DEI). These workshops/elements of training, which were universally praised, represent skills that are
critical for success in interdisciplinary science and enhance success for all students, particularly
underrepresented students because of the focus on and positive impact of networking. These six elements
represent unique aspects of training designed for this training program based on UCI’s experience of successful

10828916,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Establishment of functional neuronal circuits within the retina relies on a period of postnatal maturation. Our
knowledge of this developmental period is restricted to information from non-primate model systems. This project
aims to determine the progression of postnatal maturation across two divergent primary output pathways in the
primate retina– ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - by correlating functional activity of RGCs
obtained by single cell electrophysiology to expression profiles of synaptic markers and the ultrastructural
synaptic connectivity map underlying neuronal function. Our studies will compare observations from three
postnatal timepoints before visual function and circuit maturation reaches adult profiles. In Aim 1 we will
determine the postnatal development of light evoked functional responses of ON and OFF parasol RGCs
including spike output across luminance levels and intrinsic electrical properties. In Aim 2 we will determine the
postnatal development of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto ON and OFF parasol RGCs that regulate
their responses, including expression profiles of constituent pre- and postsynaptic proteins and the 3D
ultrastructural organization of synaptic inputs. Our findings will provide the first insights into the early stages of
postnatal functional maturation across key parallel pathways (ON and OFF parasol RGCs) in the primate retina,
thereby addressing the current knowledge gap about the process of postnatal circuit and synapse maturation
during primate retinal development. Our observations will also reveal if functionally divergent retinal pathways
mature at similar or disparate rates and identify substrates that cause developmental visual deficits. Moreover,
our findings will provide important baseline information about functional maturation of primate retinal neurons
critical for developing lab grown human stem cell derived retinas that mimic functional properties of primate retina
to model and treat a wide range of retinal degenerative diseases."
10897112,"Summary
Immune cells communicate through dynamic cell-cell junctions known as immune synapses. Although the
biochemical properties of these synapses have been studied extensively, we know little about their mechanical
activities and how these activities contribute to immune function. We use cytotoxic lymphocytes as a model
system to investigate the origins and purposes of synaptic force. Cytotoxic lymphocytes fight pathogens and
cancer by forming an immune synapse with an infected or transformed target cell and then secreting toxic
granzymes and the pore forming protein perforin into the intercellular space. Work from our lab and others
suggests critical roles for mechanical forces both in triggering lymphocyte activation and in enhancing the
efficiency of killing responses. Our proposed studies, which are divided into two Specific Aims, will address the
functional relevance and molecular bases of synaptic force in these contexts. Aim 1 builds on preliminary data
indicating that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells detect the physical stiffening of
target cells and use this mechanosensing capacity to identify and destroy cancer cells invading the metastatic
niche. To determine if and how this mechanical form of immunosurveillance, which we call
mechanosurveillance, shapes anti-tumor immunity in vivo, we will apply multiple murine metastasis models,
atomic force microscopy, and analysis of clinical immunotherapy trials. Aim 2 is premised on prior work
indicating that CTLs use mechanical force to potentiate the pore forming activity of secreted perforin. This sort
of physicochemical synergy demands a high degree of coordination between mechanical and secretory output
within the synapse, but how lymphocytes achieve this coupling remains unknown. We have developed an
imaging-based biophysical approach to address this problem, which will enable us to establish the
mechanochemical choreography of cytotoxicity with unprecedented precision. Our proposed studies will
employ technically innovative methods, including super-resolution imaging of lymphocyte force exertion against
micron-scale biophysical probes. They will also introduce a number of innovative concepts, including the idea
that cellular rigidity can trigger immunosurveillance and the idea that lymphocyte subsets employ distinct
mechanical signatures to specify their effector responses. Our work will also address a simple but technically
vexing issue that has constrained the field for some time, namely whether mechanobiological principles
actually influence immunity in vivo. Understanding the biophysical dimensions of immune synapse function
could potentially reveal new strategies for the modulation and assessment of lymphocyte activity in the clinic.
As such, the studies described herein are highly relevant to the NIH mission in that they will contribute to the
advancement of knowledge that could improve human health."
10843262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION)
In the US, 15% to 54% of cancer patients are cigarette smokers at the time of their diagnosis. Unfortunately,
up to 80% of smokers with cancer continue to smoke after their diagnosis. Persistent smoking after a cancer
diagnosis leads to worse clinical outcomes including decreased treatment effectiveness, increased risk of
disease recurrence, increased risk of developing second cancers, and higher mortality rates. The National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that every cancer patient who smokes be offered an
evidence-based cessation intervention. However, limited access to effective tobacco cessation interventions is
a key barrier for promoting cessation in the context of cancer care. Needed now is a method for all smokers
with cancer to access effective and low-cost interventions designed to help this special population stop
smoking. A smartphone application (“app”) could address the access need by providing a widely available
tobacco intervention targeted for cancer patients. Apps have potentially high population level reach to cancer
patients—especially given that over three quarters (76%) of all smokers own smartphones. Despite their high
potential value, there is no evidence about: (1) the effectiveness of smartphone apps targeted to cancer
patients who smoke and (2) why these apps would be effective. Also unexplored is who is most likely to benefit
from smartphone apps targeted to cancer patients who smoke. We recently developed the first known
smartphone app (called “Quit2Heal”) specifically designed to help cancer patients quit smoking. We compared
Quit2Heal with the NCI’s QuitGuide, a widely used smoking cessation app for the general population, in a pilot
randomized controlled trial with 59 adult cancer patients who smoke. With 92% retention at the 2-month follow-
up, 30-day point prevalence quit rate was 20% for Quit2Heal vs. 7% for QuitGuide (OR=5.16; 95% CI: .71,
37.29; p=.104). Building on these knowledge gaps and encouraging results, this application proposes to
conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial of Quit2Heal (n = 211) versus QuitGuide (n = 211), in order
to determine whether: (1) Quit2Heal has significantly higher biochemically verified 30-day point prevalence
smoking cessation at 12 months post-randomization relative to QuitGuide, and (2) Quit2Heal’s (but not
QuitGuide’s) 12-month smoking cessation outcome is significantly mediated by improvements in cancer-
related shame, stigma, depression, anxiety, and knowledge about consequences of smoking vs. quitting after
cancer diagnosis. The project will also explore whether these baseline factors moderate the cessation
outcome: (a) cancer type, (b) stage of cancer, (c) time since diagnosis, (d) demographics, (e) having a
partner/spouse who smokes, (f) whether participant was advised to quit by oncologist, and (g) recruitment
source. If the aims are achieved, this project will advance scientific knowledge about the effectiveness of apps
for helping cancer patients quit smoking. Positive results would provide an effective and highly accessible
public health intervention for cancer patients."
10864983,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nursing home (NH) residents with type 2 diabetes have substantial multimorbidity that complicates diabetes
management. Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias affects nearly 50% of NH residents and may
increase risk of hypoglycemia. Current NH diabetes management guidelines do not address Alzheimer's
Disease and related dementias and current recommendations for NH target blood glucose ranges are based
on expert opinion rather than evidence of adverse geriatric outcomes at certain thresholds of glycemia. To
address these weaknesses, we propose the following aims: 1) to compare the incidence rates of hypo- and
hyper-glycemia in the NH by dementia status, 2) to examine the acute effects of hypo- and hyper-glycemia on
geriatric syndromes and evaluate whether Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias modifies glycemic
thresholds, and 3) to examine the cumulative effects of hypo- and hyper-glycemia on cognitive decline and
functional decline, and to determine whether baseline severity of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias
modifies glycemic thresholds. The proposed research leverages existing Veterans Affairs electronic health
record databases, a unique source of routine fingerstick glucose measurements. The long-term goal of this
research is to establish NH-specific target blood glucose ranges with thresholds of hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia that account for the presence of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. Dr. Lee seeks a

Candidate: Jessica Golbus, MD, MS is a heart failure (HF) and transplant cardiologist at the University of
Michigan. Her long-term goal is to use mobile health (mHealth) technologies to deliver personalized, lifestyle
interventions to patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVD) to support them in longitudinal disease
self-management. This proposal builds on Dr. Golbus’s prior mHealth research, providing her with protected
time to train in behavioral health theory, user-centered design, and mHealth study design.
Environment and Career Development Plan: The training and research activities will be conducted at the
University of Michigan, a world-class scientific environment that promotes multi-disciplinary collaboration. The
research will be completed under the mentorship of primary mentor Brahmajee Nallamothu, MD, MPH and co-
mentors Kenneth Resnicow, PhD and Predrag Klasnja, PhD who are leaders in cardiovascular and mHealth
research, behavioral health theory, and user-centered design, respectively. This will be complemented by a
scientific advisory board with expertise in clinical trials, community-based participatory research, statistical
methods for mHealth studies, and HF. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and
professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence.
Background: Through this career development award, Dr. Golbus proposes to address the important clinical
problem of physical inactivity in HF patients. While increased physical activity reduces hospitalizations and
improves quality-of-life in this population, many HF patients participate insufficiently in physical activity.
Existing strategies to increase physical activity levels have not accounted for the unique needs of HF patients,
such as time-varying biological and psychosocial factors impacting activity levels, or are resource-intensive.
There is thus a need for innovative strategies to increase physical activity for HF patients.
Research: The overarching goals of this proposal are two-fold. First, it will characterize real-time factors
impacting physical activity participation in a diverse cohort of HF patients using mHealth technologies, which
will then be used to design and pilot a physical activity just-in-time adaptive intervention. The proposal’s 3

10848497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prenatal air pollution exposure has been repeatedly identified as risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
with support for associations with particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), ozone, and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Research from other fields suggests diet may be a key modulator of air pollution risks in
pathways relevant to autism, yet only one study, examining the joint effects of folate and air pollution, has been
published on ASD risk. However, a range of dietary factors beyond folate, including polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) and vitamin D, may serve to offset effects of exposures. In addition, given that nutrients do not act in
isolation, studying single nutrient-pollutant interactions may provide only part of the picture. Further, time-
windows for such modification have not been identified. In the proposed study, we will address these gaps and
examine how prenatal diet may modify air pollutant associations with ASD-related outcomes in two prospective
cohorts. The Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) is an ongoing, large prospective cohort of nurses from across the
US that includes a pregnancy sub-cohort (n>7,000). The Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI)
is a high-risk cohort that followed mothers who already had a child with ASD through a subsequent pregnancy
until that child was age 3 (n~200). ASD-related outcomes will be captured in both studies according to Social
Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, as well as ASD diagnosis, allowing us to consider both dimensional traits
across the population and diagnostic-level risks. Both studies will have air pollution exposure assignments for
PM2.5, NO2, and ozone from the same method and prenatal nutrient data from validated food frequency
questionnaires. Using these data, our aims are to: 1) Examine modification of air pollutant-ASD associations by
folate, vitamin D, and PUFAs; 2) Evaluate interactions between air pollutants and nutrients on ASD-related
outcomes within a multi-exposure framework; and 3) Examine time windows in the air pollution-ASD relationship
when dietary nutrients might be most impactful. Aim 1 analyses will use linear and logistic regression to examine
associations with SRS scores and ASD diagnosis, respectively, within strata of nutrients defined by deficiency
status and prior interaction in each cohort. In Aim 2, we will use Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR)
to consider nutrient-pollutant interactions within the context of broader diet, accounting for a wider set of nutrients
and considering potential combined effects on ASD outcomes. In Aim 3, we will use distributed lag models to
consider potential critical windows of air pollutant associations with ASD-related outcomes in which nutrient
modifiers may have strongest effects. In this proposal we address a critical, yet understudied, area of research.
Due to the widespread occurrence of air pollution exposure, and because diet is a readily accessible, individual-
level modifiable factor, findings from this project present the potential for a large public health impact."

Macrophages (MΦs) kill microorganisms, engulf dead cells and debris, and regulate the immune response. They
are thus gatekeepers of tissue health, including the lungs. The lung-tissue-resident MΦs (TR-MΦs) are the
interstitial and alveolar MΦs, which have complementary but distinct functions. In response to infections, lungs
are rapidly populated by waves of Ly6C+ circulating monocytes. In concert with TR-MΦs, these monocytes fight
the infection, then facilitate the resolution of the inflammatory response. Many chronic lung inflammatory
diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), are associated with dysregulated MΦ function. Our long- term goal is to
understand how different lung MΦ populations contribute to lung hyper-inflammation and infection and to
elucidate the biology of these distinct cell populations. The objective of this proposal is to characterize ezrin’s
role in monocyte/MΦ function. Our central hypothesis is that ezrin controls monocyte/MΦ cortical actin
organization and signal transduction events in response to inflammatory/infectious stimuli. These cellular
changes allow the MΦs to spread, move, phagocytize, and survive, thus shaping the magnitude and quality of
the lung immune response to infections. The rationale for these studies is that low ezrin levels have been found
in MΦs from patients with CF (our work). Other investigators have also reported low ezrin levels in blood cells
from individuals with asthma. Thus, by elucidating the molecular mechanism by which ezrin shapes lung MΦ
functions, we could identify potential therapeutic targets for lung diseases. Our specific aims will test the following
hypotheses: (Aim 1) ezrin is required for the signaling that drives MΦs to adhere to the lung extracellular matrix
and to differentiate in response to LPS; (Aim 2) ezrin is needed for efficient phagocytosis of Staphylococcus
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two microorganisms that CF patients fail to efficiently eradicate from their
lungs; (Aim 3) the acquired “cellular ezrin low-state” inactivated CF MΦs is central to their uncontrolled immune
signaling and reduced phagocytosis. The contribution is significant since very little is known about ezrin’s role in
regulating lung MΦ activation. Our proposed research is innovative because we will use an unprecedented
mouse model in which ezrin is knocked out in monocytes and MΦs. Thus, the proposed studies will investigate in
depth the consequences of ezrin loss in monocytes and MΦs during lung infection and inflammation."

NIEHS has established Predictive Toxicology as a strategic goal for advancing environmental health sciences.
The overarching goal of this RIVER proposal is to predict animal toxicity of chemicals based on their structure.
My team and I will expose millions of zebrafish embryos to a library of 10,000 synthetic chemicals across wide
concentration ranges. If a chemical shows signs of bioactivity, we will systematically analyze whole animal gene
expression changes before the phenotype appears. We will formulate hypotheses about which biomolecular
targets the chemicals attacked initially and which pathways led to the observed endpoint. To test those
hypotheses, we will edit the zebrafish genome via CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out or over-express critical genes, to
discover the ones causally related to the chemical phenotypes.
These studies will be highly relevant to human health. Zebrafish possess fully integrated vertebrate organ
systems that perform the same functions as their human counterparts and demonstrate well-conserved
physiology. Eighty-four percent of the genes that participate in human disease also exist in zebrafish. Zebrafish
studies provide a fast, inexpensive way to screen a large volume of chemicals, generate rich hypotheses for drug
development, and prioritize candidates for toxicity studies with mammals and human cell cultures. We will
compare our results with those of human cell culture studies to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each
method and to reduce the uncertainty associated with applying zebrafish results to human biology.
We will post our experimental results in a public database that explains which of the 10,000 Tox21 chemicals
are bioactive, which initial targets they strike, and which pathways lead to which endpoints in embryonic and
juvenile zebrafish. This information will enable green chemists to detoxify products by substituting a
biologically inactive molecule. It will help toxicologists and risk assessors to prioritize chemicals for expensive
experiments with rodents and human cell cultures. It will give pharmaceutical scientists thousands of new data
points upon which to develop hypotheses about how to modulate a given gene target or activate a given
pathway.
We will use machine-learning-based chemoinformatic approaches to analyze our zebrafish data and infer the
relationship between the structure of a chemical and its biological activity. Our rich data about chemical
activity networks will advance the scientific community’s understanding of linkages between chemical exposure
and phenotypes. Our work will enable scientists to predict whether a chemical will be biologically active, what
target it will act upon, and what networks it will perturb, solely on the basis of its structure. It will enable
scientists to reduce, refine, and replace experiments with animals, including zebrafish, and to predict chemical
activity networks with computers."

 The etiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is multi-factorial. Abnormal and excessive cumulative joint stress results
in post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Approximately 30% of knee OA in Veterans is attributable to
occupational activities, particularly jobs requiring kneeling or squatting in combination with heavy lifting, such
as sport activity injuries. Currently, there is no effective therapy for OA patients. Recently, the stem cell therapy
has shown promise to regenerate the damaged joint tissue. In our previous study, adipose-derived stem cells
(ASCs) show great promise as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine because of their multi-lineage
potential, immunosuppressive activities, limited immunogenicity, and relative ease of growth in culture.
However, there are several concerns that impede the clinical use of stem cell therapy in the inflammatory joint
environment such as apoptosis, dosing, timing of intervention, homing efficacy, and route of delivery of ASCs.
We have also found that NF-κB inhibitors such as TPCA-1 decrease inflammation in mechanically injured knee
joints using our established PTOA mouse model and in vitro model.
 In this project, we aim our studies based on two points: 1) Pre-treatment of exogenously derived ASCs with
antioxidant (such as Vitamin-E) before injection into the joint can lead to cyto-protective effects and resistance
to apoptosis and toxic inflammatory factors after transplantation. 2) TPCA1-nanosome can improve the harsh
condition in the arthritic knee joint by anti-inflammatory mechanism before transplantation of an exogenous
stem cell. Therefore, we will show the synergistic effect of this two-step therapeutic application (anti-
inflammatory nanosome treatment of the arthritic joint followed by transplantation of the Preconditioned ASCs).
 We have two aims: (1) Investigate the cytoprotective effects and therapeutic potential of preconditioned
ASCs in a model of PTOA. In this aim, we will investigate the therapeutic effect of the antioxidant (Vit-E-Ns)
pre-treated ASCs in vivo using our PTOA mouse model of knee overloading. In order to tailor this approach to
the appropriate veteran population (active vs retired) we will use aged mice to investigate whether they exhibit
different healing responses and mechanisms relative to younger mice. We will confirm the persistence of the
ASCs in the joint, correlating implantation levels with the reduction and repair of damaged cartilage as well as
optimizing the cell number and treatment interval. We will examine localization of the ASCs in the joint and
assess joint inflammation and cartilage integrity. We will investigate treatment-associated changes in the
biomechanical properties of subchondral bone and cartilage and its effects on pain-related behavior through
functional analyses. We will also investigate the recovery mechanism using an ASC-chondrocyte co-culture
system. (2) Demonstrate the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of the two-step application: TPCA1-Nanosome
(TPCA1-Ns) injection prior to transplantation of the preconditioned ASCs in a mouse model of PTOA. In this
aim, we will neutralize inflammation using TPCA1-Ns treatment followed by the utilization of Vit-E nanosome
pretreated ASCs for transplantation into the PTOA mouse model established in our lab. In this Aim 3, we will
examine the functional outcomes of the cartilage, bone, and synovial tissues after the two-step treatment
consisting of the combined injection of the TPCA1-Ns and transplantation of the preconditioned ASCs. This
two-step anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-nanosome treatment strategy can improve the toxic micro-
environment of the arthritic knee joint via delivery of TPCA1-Ns, and also prolong the ASCs viability to obtain
enough time to survive for their immune-suppressive activity.
 We believe that the data obtained from this project will serve as a basis for understanding the mechanism of
PTOA and the therapeutic efficacy of transplanted ASCs. Also, this data will help contribute to developing
strategies for clinical applications in the future."
10885940,"The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is an age-related chronic, progressive urogenital condition
that disproportionately affects postmenopausal women and contributes >$3 billion annually to US healthcare
costs. The impact of GSM is extensive and affects >62 million US women. Racial and ethnic minorities are
disproportionately affected but remain underrepresented in aging and sexual health related studies. The vaginal
microbiota is a critical determinant in urogenital and sexual health, and we hypothesize this relationship may be
mediated through host-microbial metabolite interactions. As women age, estrogen levels decline disrupting
estrogen-dependent processes. In a large cohort (n=1190), I observed chronological aging to be associated with
altered lipid metabolism (e.g., lipid peroxidation), loss of protective vaginal lactobacilli, cellular damage (e.g.,
increased oxidative stress metabolites), and a decline in vaginal antioxidants (e.g., vitamins). Oxidative stress
induces inflammation, and biomarkers of oxidative stress within serum and plasma have been linked to age-
related pathologies (e.g., osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease). Some antioxidants
can be produced by the host (e.g., glutathione), while others must be obtained through the diet and microbiota
(e.g., vitamins). Antioxidants serve to neutralize oxidative and osmotic stress and their decline increases
susceptibility to oxidative stress related pathologies. This has not been yet described within the vagina. The K99
phase proposes to (1) Characterize the relation of vaginal LAO profiles with reproductive stage, chronological
age, and race/ethnicity; and (2) Quantify the longitudinal mediation between LAO profiles and GSM by combining
machine learning, structural models, and multi-omics (metabolomics, immunology, and microbiota) Vaginal
samples leveraged for this proposal are available via an NIA award (R01AG069915, PI: Shardell, Co-Sponsor)
and represent a longitudinal cohort (N=500 participants; 25% racial/ethnic minorities; 1200 samples) with varying
signs and symptoms of GSM. This will be the largest vaginal metabolomic cohort emphasizing post-menopausal
women, to date. Samples have already been sent for microbiome, metabolomic, and cytokine profiling. I will
complete formal coursework and mentoring in immunology, machine learning, and structural models in
preparation for the independent R00 phase where I propose to determine the inflammatory response of
human vaginal epithelial cells [HVECs] following exposure to LAO metabolites and microbiota.
Information gleaned during this work will be useful in developing targeted interventions (e.g., antioxidant therapy)
for GSM and will inform an R01 application for a large-scale, multi-center validation study that will permit targeted
management of GSM. All aims will contribute to my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in
microbiology with a focus on improving gynecological outcomes and advocating accessibility (lower cost,
personalized targets of intervention) for communities that have been historically underserved and marginalized.
My heritage will direct the foci of this proposal and aligns with MOSAIC K99/R00 objectives."
10805467,"Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many aspects of development (e.g., social,
cognitive) throughout life, and altered neurodevelopment in early life is considered an
important feature of ASD pathophysiology. There is, however, considerable uncertainty
regarding the neuromaturational trajectory of ASD beyond early childhood—into the
transitional periods of adolescence and aging. White matter is necessary for the
development of specialized brain circuits. White matter tracts follow a protracted
developmental trajectory, peaking in the third to fourth decades of life, and, critically, their
maturation may be differentially altered in ASD. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is currently the most
effective non-invasive technique for probing white matter in vivo. Studies of white matter
using dMRI in ASD in later childhood to adulthood, however, have provided inconsistent
findings. A major hindrance to reproducible white matter results in ASD is low statistical
power. Over the last decade, extensive shared multimodal ASD datasets have been
made available through large initiatives such as the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange, and National Database for Autism Research. The dMRI data from these
resources, however, are currently underutilized. In addition, large consortia studies (e.g.,
the Human Connectome Project) have made high-quality dMRI data available in healthy
individuals across the lifespan. Recent methodological advances in data harmonization
of dMRI data allow mitigating differences across imaging sites and protocols. This project
aims to leverage available multi-site dMRI data (>2600 participants; >600 ASD, >2000
TD; from up to 17 sites) to perform joint large-scale analyses that will elucidate the
spatiotemporal pattern of white matter atypicalities in ASD across the lifespan (age 2-70
years). We propose to i) Aggregate, process, and quality control dMRI datasets of
individuals with ASD and TD controls from shared databases, and ii) Examine cross-
sectional lifespan age trajectories of microstructural measures of white matter tracts at
the group level, and multivariate patterns of white matter microstructure at the individual
level (using deep normative modeling), in ASD relative to TD controls, and link atypicality
of white matter patterns with ASD symptoms. Exploratory analyses on the effects of sex
and cognitive abilities will also be performed. This research may aid treatment and policy
development by identifying the location and timing of vulnerable neural pathways and
circuits in ASD, and, additionally, promote reproducible diffusion MRI research."
10732225,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent among Veterans and associated with significant cost,
disability and mortality. Although evidence-based medications and psychotherapies are available to treat MDD,
full and sustained remission is uncommon. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-cleared
intervention that offers a novel strategy for treating patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). TMS is
available within the VA through the VA Clinical TMS Pilot Program. TMS is based in a neural circuit paradigm
of MDD positing that stimulation at a key node (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) can restore function within a
network of brain regions involved in mood regulation. Although a substantial number of TRD patients respond
well to TMS, many do not. This suggests some patients have a form of neural network dysfunction that is more
amenable to TMS. Resting electroencephalography (EEG) provides a safe, convenient and reliable way to
measure focal brain electrical activity and neural network function. Prior studies have identified EEG markers
associated with response to antidepressant medications, but limited research has been conducted to identify
EEG markers predictive of an antidepressant response with TMS. This is a critical gap, since TMS likely
operates via direct modulation of neural network activity, such that baseline differences in neural
network function should help identify which patients are more or less likely to respond to TMS.
Investigators in our group have identified putative predictive EEG-based biomarkers for response to TMS for
TRD. One of these (differential patterns of gamma oscillations) may specifically predict response to 10 Hz TMS
applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the type of TMS received by >80% of Veterans receiving TMS
in the TMS Pilot Program. Another (changes in theta cordance early in the course of treatment) may predict
eventual response to TMS; this potential biomarker was identified by Dr. Andrew Leuchter (a consultant on this
grant) and has been shown to also predict response to antidepressant medications and deep brain stimulation
for TRD. By adding baseline (pretreatment) and weekly resting EEG assessment to the VA National
Clinical TMS Pilot Program, the goals of this study are to: (1) test a potential response biomarker
measured at baseline in a large sample of Veterans receiving TMS to treat depression (N=400); (2)
assess whether a second putative biomarker (early changes in theta cordance during treatment)
predict eventual response to TMS; (3) leverage this large sample to identify other potential biomarkers
(such as markers of early versus late response to TMS, markers of response to other TMS parameters
(e.g., 5 Hz, 1 Hz or theta burst TMS), and markers of change with treatment that may speak to
mechanism); and (3) create an infrastructure to rapidly identify and test additional EEG-based
biomarkers of treatment response in patients with depression and other psychiatric conditions
relevant to the VA, such as PTSD and/or TBI. The infrastructure created will initially consist of the five sites
that form the core of this study group, then expand to include a total of 10 sites over the course of the project. It
is hoped that this infrastructure will continue to expand over time to include as many of the sites in the TMS
Pilot Program as possible. This study, and the infrastructure created, will be of high value to Veterans by taking
an important step towards a personalized medicine approach to the use of TMS for TRD."

Rates of suicide, self-harm, and depression are alarmingly high among adolescent girls, with a dramatic spike
over the last decade, yet it is not clear which girls are at highest risk for these serious problems and when they
might escalate. Some have argued that the dramatic rise in social media (SM) use may play a role, but more
rigorous data are needed to evaluate the positive and negative effects of SM use in adolescent girls. Sensitivity
to social evaluation, such as rejection or exclusion, is a potential cross-diagnostic risk factor for self-injurious
thoughts and behaviors (SITB; including suicidal ideation and behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury) and de-
pressive symptoms (DEPsx). This study examines how socially threatening and rewarding peer interactions—
experienced online or in-person—contribute to real-time fluctuations in SITB, DEPsx, and well-being. The first
aim is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify how adolescent girls’ daily subjective experi-
ence of online and in-person social threat and reward predict proximal within-person changes and longer-term
between-person differences in SITB and DEPsx, along with wellbeing. The sample will include 177 adolescent
girls (ages 13-17), with 75% of the sample at high-risk for suicide (e.g. active ideation within past 6 weeks, at-
tempt in past year, or ≥ five episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury in past year), with at least half of high-risk par-
ticipants also reporting elevated DEPsx. Girls will complete three 10-day bursts of EMA and will also provide
access to passively obtained data on SM use and digital social interactions (i.e. text, video-chat). Multilevel
modeling analyses will be used to identify predictors of near-term changes in SITB, DEPsx, and positive affect
(PA), as well as long-term outcomes assessed at 6- and 12-month follow-up. A second aim is to identify which
girls are at highest risk for DEPsx and/or SITB when exposed to near-term precipitants, focusing on differences
in brain activation to social evaluation within an affective salience network (ASN) that includes the amygdala,
anterior insula, dorsal and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Building on the differ-
ential susceptibility to context theory, the study proposes that heightened ASN activation to social evaluation is
a susceptibility factor that could amplify both the positive and negative effects of daily social experience on
SITB and DEPsx. Girls will complete neuroimaging tasks that assess brain response to social evaluation from
virtual peers. It is hypothesized that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social threat experiences
(online and in-person) will be most strongly associated with SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN
activation to social evaluation, and that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social reward experi-
ences will also be more strongly associated with PA/wellbeing and more protective against SITB and DEPsx for
girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation. Finally, machine learning will be used to determine
which objective features of SM use track in real-time with subjective experience and emotional health, and to
identify the strongest set of predictors of short-term and long-term emotional health."

The oral microbiome is a complex multispecies ecosystem. Deciphering the interactions of microbes with each
other and their host habitats is essential for understanding the oral microbiome's role in health and disease and
for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies. To successfully modulate the microbiome we need to
understand the genomic drivers of bacterial site tropisms and community membership. Much of the molecular
data needed to address these fundamental questions already exists in publicly available databases, but has not
been analyzed within an ecologic framework using appropriate bioinformatic tools and in sufficient depth. While
genome information exists for most bacterial species in the mouth, there has been no systematic analysis of
what genes are core or accessory for the major species – information critical for assessing microbial function
and for selecting strains for in vitro models. The scientific premise of our proposal is that the combination of
pangenomic analysis with oral metagenomic information, hence metapangenomics, will test the site-specialist
hypothesis and provide unique, gene-level insights into the function of the oral microbiome.
We will construct pangenomes from high-quality genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) to identify core and accessory genes of oral species. We will map metagenomic data from the Human
Microbiome Project (HMP), and other sources, onto the pangenomes to assess which genomes actually occur
in the human mouth. Analysis by oral site will identify site-tropisms at the genomic level, thus evaluating the site-
specialist hypothesis. We will determine which genes are unique to a species or strain occupying a particular
oral niche, and we will identify candidate gene drivers of site tropism. The products of our analysis will be made
available to the oral research community by expanding the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD),
developed by Dr. Dewhirst, a PI on this proposal. Pangenomes will be made available interactively via a new
platform for Analysis and Visualization of Omics Information (Anvi'o) created by Dr. Eren, a PI on this proposal.
The impact of the project is that it will establish a genomic, ecologic framework for understanding the oral
microbiome. It will provide a detailed, species, strain- and gene-level analysis of the oral microbiome in the
context of individual oral sites. It will identify key genes for follow-up mechanistic studies on site tropisms, niche
adaptation, and pathogenesis. It will improve authentication and error-correction of key bacterial species and
strains. The project builds on the existing strengths of HOMD, NCBI and HMP, makes available to researchers
the results of cutting-edge genomic analysis, and lays the groundwork for propelling oral microbiome research
into the pangenomic and metagenomic era."

The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial that uses a Sequential Multiple Assignment
Randomized Trial (SMART) study design. The study will directly compare the efficacy of an
innovative intervention that combines explicit and implicit approaches to a traditional implicit
treatment approach to teach true grammatical forms to children with developmental language
disorder (DLD). The study will also compare interventions that include sequences of Explicit-
added and Implicit-only treatments. Participants will include 5- through 8-year-old children with
DLD who present with significant grammatical weaknesses. In Phase 1, 155 participants will be
randomized 1:1 to an Explicit-added treatment group or an Implicit-only treatment group. Each
participant will complete 32 sessions targeting four unique grammatical forms (8 sessions/form).
In Phase 2, “Masters” will be re-randomized to receive no treatment 32 sessions of the same
treatment, or 32 sessions of the alternative treatment. “Non-Masters” will be re-randomized to
receive 32 additional sessions of the same treatment or 32 sessions of the alternative treatment.
Performance will be measured on acquisition, maintenance, and generalization probes obtained
immediately,1-, 6-, and 12- months post-intervention. The SMART study design will be used to
determine if child factors, including expressive and receptive language abilities, nonverbal IQ,
and executive function skills can reliably predict the treatment sequence that optimizes
language learning. Study results will help to determine the best sequence approach to
ameliorate grammatical weaknesses, one of the core deficits of young children with language
impairment."

We have recently shown that the ancestors of all Aedes aegypti populations in both sub-Saharan Africa as well
as around the world presently reside on islands in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) including Madagascar.
These islands gave rise to continental African Ae. aegypti formosus no earlier than about 100,000 years ago.
We propose multidisciplinary studies on SWIO populations of Ae. aegypti along with its close relatives, Ae.
mascarensis and Ae. pia. This will include population genetics, phylogenetics/phylogeography, vector
competence, blood meal analyses, and characterization of the virome of field-caught females. We address
question such as: Are the ancestors that gave rise to Ae. aegypti s.s. capable of transmitting the same viruses
that cause human diseases? Are these mosquitoes carrying the same viruses in the field and/or do they
harbor novel undescribed arboviruses? What are the sources of their blood meals? Where do they breed?
Population genetics and phylogenetic preliminary work have already identified candidates for new undescribed
species and we suspect more cryptic taxa will be found. We propose to assemble complete genomes for the
most informative populations/taxa that will allow comparative studies as well as inference of the ancestral
genome of Ae. aegypti s.s., a fundamental resource for analysis of a plethora of genomics studies ongoing in
laboratories around the world."
10844397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Making healthy food choices and eating in moderation during early childhood are central to obesity prevention
and are thought to require effortful and goal-directed self-regulation. Appetite self-regulation (ASR) has been
described as involving children’s use of eating-specific, “top-down” cognitive processes to moderate “bottom-
up” biological drives to eat. Much of the research to date on ASR has focused on the role of bottom-up drives
in shaping children’s behavioral susceptibility to obesity. Alternatively, little is known about the cognitive-
developmental processes that shape children’s ability to make healthy food choices and eat in moderation
during early childhood. Current perspectives hold that ASR is distinct from general self-regulation (e.g.,
executive functioning [EF]) among children, highlighting the large gap in scientific understanding of cognitive
developmental influences on healthy eating and obesity prevention during the preschool years. The goal of
this R21 exploratory investigation is to produce rigorous evidence of cognitive developmental
influences on healthy eating behaviors (i.e., healthy food choices, eating in moderation) and weight
status during preschool through the development of new measures of top-down ASR. Preschool is an
important period for studying top-down ASR given the significant socialization of eating behaviors and rapid
maturation of top-down regulatory processes that occur during this period. Participants will be 150
preschoolers (75 with normal weight, 75 with overweight or obesity) and their primary caregiver. Given well-
documented socioeconomic disparities in self-regulation, diet quality, obesity among children, we will
oversample families with low-income backgrounds. We will adapt existing measures of inhibitory, working
memory, and attention shifting–core aspects of EF – to develop new measures of eating-specific, top-down
ASR. ASR/EF associations with laboratory-based observations of children’s eating behaviors, body mass index
z-scores, and questionnaire-based measures of food parenting will be assessed. Aim 1 will adapt well-
established objective observational measures of top-down EF to assess top-down ASR regulation among
preschoolers. Aim 2 will examine the protective role of top-down ASR in making healthful food choices, eating
in moderation, and weight status among preschoolers. Given that parenting represents a socialization pathway
that can hinder or facilitate self-regulation in children, Aim 3 will evaluate associations of food parenting
structure and autonomy support with top-down ASR among children. Raising children to make healthy food
choices and eat in moderation in the current obesogenic environment may require more explicit involvement of
cognitive-developmental processes around eating than has been previously appreciated. The findings of this
investigation will yield novel scientific directions for obesity prevention by elucidating cognitive developmental
influences on healthy food choices, eating in moderation, and weight status among preschoolers."

Mapping the brain-wide connections of neurons provides a foundation for understanding the structure and
functions of a brain. Neuroanatomical techniques based on light-microscopy or electron microscopy have
advanced tremendously in throughput and cost in recent years, but it remains challenging to scale them up
to systematically interrogate large non-human primate (NHP) brains. Here we propose to develop
sequencing-based neuroanatomical approaches to achieve high throughput and highly multiplexed brain-
wide mapping of neuronal projections and synaptic connectivity in NHPs at cellular resolution. Unlike
microscopy-based techniques, which rely on visually tracing individual axons from the somas to axonal
termini, sequencing-based approaches label neurons with unique virally encoded RNA sequences, or
“barcodes.” Sequencing and matching barcodes thus reveals the projections and/or synaptic connectivity
of neurons. Thus, by transforming projection and connectivity mapping into sequencing problems,
sequencing-based neuroanatomical approaches are not constrained by the same tradeoffs that plague
microscopy-based techniques. Specifically, we will develop and optimize three techniques for brain-wide
mapping. First, we will optimize BRICseq (brain-wide individual animal connectome sequencing), which
can currently map the projections of tens to hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single mouse brain at
cellular resolution. We aim to adapt BRICseq for NHP brains, further reduce cost and increase throughput,
to achieve the ability to map a million neurons per brain at cellular resolution at extremely low cost per
neuron. Second, we will optimize BARseq (barcoded anatomy resolve by sequencing) for NHP brains.
BARseq uses in situ sequencing of the same viral barcodes used in BRICseq to achieve higher resolution
in projection mapping and to also read out gene expression in the same neurons. Thus, BARseq can
associate neuronal projections with cell types defined by gene expression in individual neurons. We will
automate in situ sequencing, reduce probe cost, and scale up BARseq to achieve the ability to map brain-
wide projections in NHP brains. Finally, we will develop barcoded rabies virus-based monosynaptic tracing
to achieve highly multiplexed mapping of synaptic connectivity of neuronal types at cellular resolution.
Determining the synaptic connectivity of neuronal types will powerfully constrain and test computational
models of circuit function beyond what knowing the axonal projections allows. We will apply all three
techniques to generate a multi-resolution projection and synaptic connectivity map of the macaque visual
cortex. With the ability to generate massive single-neuron datasets and the ability to link projections and
synaptic connectivity to neuronal types, our proposed techniques complement mature techniques

Currently, 1.5 million older adults live in Long Term Care (LTC) facilities and that number is increasing. Their
need for dental care is also growing since almost 70% of older adults are now dentate. Even though dental
caries and periodontal disease are preventable, 96% of dentate adults over age 65 years have caries
experience, at least 20% are living with untreated decay and 68% have periodontal disease. Both conditions
are the result of dynamic processes which are accelerated by polypharmacy, comorbidities, and frailty.
Although there is no national data regarding the oral health status of long-term care (LTC) residents, small
cohort studies consistently document that LTC residents have substantially worse oral health than the
population of community-dwelling elders. Faced with the burden of declining health and diminished
independence, older adults in LTC are less likely to access dental care and more likely to develop new
cavities and worsening periodontal disease, hence preventive care is vital. However, most research in oral
health and LTC has focused on care-pathways for receiving restorative treatment, but significant barriers
exist which limit LTC residents’ ability to access this care. Alternatively, there is a focus on having care
assistants perform oral hygiene care (OHC), when in practice they are often not provided adequate training
or time to offer the OHC. This is further complicated by the fact that the residents of LTC are experiencing
diminishing independence and increasing frailty. Given the complexity of the LTC setting, a siloed biomedical
approach to disease management is also unlikely to reduce new dental caries and periodontal bone loss and
the resultant burden. To address this complexity, this project will use the Health Co-design toolbox together
with the WHO Health Systems thinking framework to co-design a system intervention to reduce the increment
of caries and periodontal disease. This investigation will seek to understand the experiences of residents and
staff as a starting point for developing a comprehensive model of preventive oral health care. Initially, the
current system supporting oral health in LTC will be mapped through a retrospective clinical audit and a series
of focus groups. Then, a design team of stakeholders will work with investigators to co-design an intervention
that works on multiple agents and processes within the system. Possible examples include, clinicians
assessing caries risk and prescribing preventive agents, equipping in-house dispensaries with oral hygiene
aides, and EMRs prompts to initiate oral health referrals for certain medical diagnosis. Simulation Modelling,
based on system mapping data, will conceptualize the effects of the intervention by using different
mechanism of prevention and different patterns of disease. An external advisory panel will provide feedback
on qualitative data and the system intervention protocol. If proven effective, this model has the potential to
inform public policy and reduce the oral health inequities experienced by 1.5 million LTC residents in the U.S."
10884088,"Project Summary. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the principle transducers of fast glutamatergic neurotransmission
throughout the central nervous system (CNS), where they control the strength of excitatory synapses and modulate
long-term potentiation (LTP) - a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory function. AMPAR dysfunction has
been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore
pharmacological modulation of AMPAR represents an attractive therapeutic approach. Positron emission tomograohy
(PET) is capable of quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable AMPAR ligand would substantially
improve our understanding of AMPAR-mediated ionotropic glutamate signaling under different pathophysiological AD
conditions, otherwise inaccessible by ex vivo (destructive) analysis. Quantification of AMPAR in living brain by PET
would provide the assessment of distribution, target engagement and dose occupancy of new AMPAR-targeted
neurotherapeutics. To date, no successful examples have been demonstrated to image GluA2-specific AMPAR for
drug discovery and clinical use, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this target in vivo. Therefore,
we propose to develop a novel PET ligand that can fill this void, as the first translational imaging tool.
 We are the first groups to develop AMPAR GluA2-specific ligands, including [11C]AMPA-1905 (developed by the
PI in 2020). However, this ligand was discontinued due to marginal binding specificity in vivo. In our 2nd generation,
we identified a lead molecule, AMPA-2076, which showed high binding affinity and excellent selectivity over all other
iGlu receptors. An 18F-isotopologue of AMPA-2076 was synthesized and preliminary PET imaging studies confirmed
that we have overcome two major obstacles for GluA2-specific AMPAR ligand development by achieving: 1)
substantially-improved in vivo stability in the brain and 2) high target specificity. Though AMPA-2076 is a promising
lead molecule for the development of new GluA2-targeted AMPAR ligands, further optimization for improved binding
specificity with proper brain kinetics are sought for translational cross-species imaging studies to achieve optimal
AMPAR (GluA2 subunit) quantification in the living brain for drug discovery and clinical translation for AD patients.
 On the basis that AMPA-2076 serves a validated lead for medicinal chemistry optimization, as specific goals, we
will design and prepare a focused library of GluA2-specific AMPAR modulators amenable for labeling with 11C or 18F,
and evaluate their ability to quantify AMPAR activity and changes during drug challenge in rodents and nonhuman
primates, as well as autoradiography and biological validation in postmortem human brain tissues. The impact of this
work is not only to develop the first successful high-affinity and selective AMPAR PET ligand for the study of
neurodegenerative disease-related biological processes, but also ultimately, via PET imaging validation in higher
species, to advance this ligand for potential clinical translation and monitor target response of novel neurotherapeutics
for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD."

The mission of “Resource Core I: the Genomic Outcomes Core” is to provide a suite of high-quality turn-key
DNA-based assays for monitoring the safety and efficacy of genome editing to support the Correction of
Neurological Disease via Allele Specific Excision of Pathogenic Repeats (CASEPR) program. The Genomic
Outcomes Core will provide the fundamental role of directly assessing the genomic effects of nuclease-based
therapeutic treatment at the target site (including measuring excision efficiency) and off-target regions of the
genome, both in cell culture models, and in experimental animal models; as such, the outcomes assessed by
the Core will complement the in vivo and biological impacts assessed by Cores II and III, respectively. For each
assay the Core will work with the appropriate project team or Core to onboard project-specific reagents or tissues
(RNPs, AAVs, cell lines, genomic DNAs etc). Working with the Administrative Core, results from analysis of all
the samples will be cataloged within the laboratory information management system (LIMS) and result reports
will be provided to the Project Teams via a standardized LIMS interface. These data will enable the selection of
preclinical leads, and provide critical feedback on genomic outcomes in cell and animal model systems. Further,
data on potency and specificity of genomic outcomes driven by preclinical Cas9-gRNA combinations for all three
Research Projects will provide a key basis for study reports to be provided to the FDA as part of regulatory filings
to ensure timely progress to IND. From a logistics perspective the consolidation of expertise for genomic assays
within the Genomic Outcomes Core will promote rapid and robust input-to-answer solutions for Project Teams
across the entire lifespan of all three Research Projects."

Dr. Lichterfeld is an infectious disease physician-scientist with a strong record of mentoring research fellows in
high-profile, patient-oriented research studies related to HIV-1 cure and eradication. He conducts a broad and
diverse research program of patient-oriented studies that include molecular and cellular immunologic studies
with patient-derived cells, translational human investigations and interventional clinical trials designed to explore
novel therapeutic approaches to reduce HIV-1 reservoirs. These research activities provide attractive and
exciting training opportunities for physicians and scientists interested and invested in developing strategies for a
functional or sterilizing cure for HIV-1 infection; in the past, several of his mentees and co-mentees have
progressed to receive R-level funding, and have been offered independent faculty positions at highly-selective
universities around the world. In the proposed K24 application, Dr. Lichterfeld will extend and expand his
successful mentoring activities in the context of three cutting-edge research areas: He will mentor trainees in the
conceptualization, design, implementation and conduct of interventional clinical trials designed to explore novel
therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 eradication (Specific Aim 1). These activities will initially focus on an already
ongoing, NIAID-funded clinical trial in which Dr. Lichterfeld serves as the PI, but will be expanded in the future
to translate novel ideas and concepts into exploratory, proof-of-concept clinical trials. These studies take
advantage of advanced clinical trial research infrastructure and a highly motivated HIV-1 patient population at
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Massachusetts General Hospital, the two hospitals Dr. Lichterfeld
is affiliated with. In addition, Dr. Lichterfeld will train his mentees in innovative next-generation sequencing and
proteomics approaches involving single-genome, near full-length viral sequencing, combined with viral
integration site analysis, chromatin accessibility assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to profile
residual viral reservoirs in patient-derived cell samples at an unprecedented breadth (Specific Aim 2). This work
will be facilitated by unique technical resources and cross-disciplinary collaborations at the Ragon Institute and
the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where Dr. Lichterfeld holds Associate Member status. Finally, Dr.
Lichterfeld will offer a distinct training experience in pediatric HIV-1 infection, focusing on the development of
interventions that may enable a long-term, drug free remission of HIV-1 infection in neonates from Botswana
(Specific Aim 3). These collaborative investigations will be performed in the context of ongoing, NIAID-funded
clinical trials investigating effects of standard antiretroviral therapy and broadly-neutralizing antibodies on viral
reservoirs and antiviral immune responses in HIV-1-infected infants started on therapy within the first days after
birth. Together, these studies provide distinct but interrelated training opportunities for physicians and scientists
to acquire the knowledge, skills, creativity and collaborations that are needed for an independent career in
patient-oriented studies focused on finding a cure for HIV-1 infection."

ABSTRACT
 We will deliver to the NIAID and CDC communities, through basic research, a scientific understanding of
pairing, mispairing, and enzymology of natural DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) that goes deeper than the
axiom that ""A pairs with T, and G pairs with C"". The experiments are designed to learn:
(a) Why robust multiplexed PCR (mPCR) for clinical use seems impossible with more than 20-30 targets.
(b) Why conventional expedients (including careful primer and probe design, internal nesting, and external
 tagging) fail to robustly support multiplexing beyond ~30 targets.
(c) Why those failures are not reproducible from sample to sample.
(d) Why conventional multiplexes targeting n targets often collapse when an n+1th target is added. This
 prevents, when a new pathogen emerges (as for 2019-nCoV), a diagnostics maker from simply adding a new
 target to an existing mPCR kit, thereby meeting the emergency need.
(e) Why manufacturing specs become increasingly more demanding as the level of multiplexing increases.
 These problems restrain 21st century diagnostics to two 20th century design and regulatory paradigms.
 (i) A ""guess-then-test"" paradigm for singleplexed molecular diagnosis, which requires physician to guess
which pathogen might be associated with patient malaise, prescribe a ~$150 singleplexed test based on that
guess, and re-prescribe further tests until a guess proves correct.
 (ii) The ""inflexible-multiplexed-panel"" paradigm. Here, assays are bundled into a multiplex appropriate for a
specific sample and symptom set; failure (d) prevents that multiplex from changing for emerging diseases.
 By developing the science of both natural and unnatural DNA (including artificially expanded genetic
information systems, AEGIS, and self avoiding molecular recognition systems, SAMRS), this project will deliver
to researchers, manufacturers, and the FDA science to meet the 21st century NIAID mission. We will:
Task 1. Complete thermodynamic and enzyme rules to place SAMRS optimally in primers that target both DNA
 and RNA. Rules will be metricked by comparing predictions made with these rules to experiments.
Task 2. Metric, by deep sequencing, mPCR failures (a) through (e).
Task 3. Metric how AEGIS and SAMRS mitigate or eliminate failures (a) through (e).
Task 4. Identify failure modes that arise with RNA targets specifically. Since RNA has folding options not
 available to DNA, these modes may be especially resistant to nucleic acid innovations.
Task 5. Build a body of statistical knowledge for AEGIS-SAMRS mPCR, especially with respect to ""add-ons"",
 quantitative amplification, and manufacturing tolerances. This will help move away from ""guess-then-
 test"" and ""inflexible-multiplexed-panel"" paradigms, lowing cost, supporting FDA regulatory processes,
 and better managing pandemics.

Medication-related morbidity and mortality are a significant health concern in older adults, who are highly
susceptible to medication-related problems. Safe medication use practices require coordinated efforts by
providers and patients in the medication use process. Medication-related problems in older adults range from
prescribing of high-risk medications to misuse of prescribed medications by older adults. Reducing medication
errors and improving medication safety are major national priorities. Therefore, our objective is to host the
Geriatric Medication Safety Symposium in the largest medical complex in the world, the Texas Medical Center
(TMC), annually to disseminate and implement the evidence-based approaches for medication safety in older
adults to improve the quality of geriatric care. The University of Houston College of Pharmacy in collaboration
with the University of Texas McGovern Medical School organized the Houston Medication Safety Symposium
for the past three years focusing on various aspects of medication safety issues such high-risk medications,
prescribing cascades, and deprescribing with presentations from nationally recognized experts. An average of
151 diverse health professions participated in the symposium each year to enrich their practice and research on
medication safety. In addition, the symposium included research podiums and posters that were published in a
peer-reviewed journal. We are requesting five years of funding to host the Geriatric Medication Safety
Symposium to continue our successful efforts to disseminate critical medication safety issues with respect to
practice, research, and policy. This annual symposium will: (i) Provide an excellent interprofessional educational
forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss evidence-based medication safety approaches in older adults;
(ii) Increase collaborations for best practices in patient care and medication safety research; and (iii) Disseminate
the knowledge and findings from the symposium nationally through webinars and publications. The proposal
includes monthly planning committee meetings from representatives of selected TMC institutions to plan and
organize the two-day symposium in the TMC, with a reach of over 20,000 healthcare professionals. The
symposium includes four plenary sessions, podium and poster sessions, and practice/research workshops, with
web-based content delivery and integration of virtual content over five years to allow for greater reach. The
areas of focus for the upcoming symposiums include off-label drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic, drug
burden, safer opioid use, adverse drug events, significant drug interactions, drug safety during transitions of
care, and medication safety in inpatient care. The target audience includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists,
students, residents, fellows, researchers, and others. Educational and media tools will be created in addition to
publishing the proceedings in the Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy journal. Overall, the Geriatric
Medication Safety Symposium will provide a unique interprofessional educational and research forum for
practitioners and researchers to make medication practices safer for older adults in the TMC and beyond."
10877136,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) present with severe pain and
increased stress which exceeds the levels seen in other cancers. Due to a multitude of factors, including
amplificition of standard therapies, HNSCC patients are now living longer with the effects of their cancer and its
treatment. The presence of pretreatment pain has been identified as a prognostic indicator of poor survival.
The prognostic and long-term effects of cancer stress are unknown. Preliminary data using preclinical mouse
models support of the efficacy of beta-adrenergic antagonism using beta-blockers in the treatment of cancer-
related pain and progression; we found a reduction in orofacial nociceptive behavior and tumor size in cancer-
bearing mice treated with propranolol in their drinking water. In addition, cancer-secreted mediators increased
the adrenergic receptor signaling in trigeminal tongue primary afferent neurons as measured by norepinephrine
evoked calcium transients. The hypothesis of this proposal is that sympathetic nervous system exacerbates
cancer pain and drives tumor progression via local adrenergic signaling in the cancer microenvironment. To
test this hypothesis, we will explore the relationship between patient-reported pain, psychological symptom
burden (i.e., anxiety, depression, social support), and circulating catecholamine levels in HNSCC patients prior
to treatment and through survivorship. We seek to determine if low pre-treatment pain and psychological
symptom burden will predeict better patient reported outcomes during survivorship. Using preclinical mouse
models of oral cancer, we will investigate the impact of cancer-mediated sensitization on adrenergic signaling
in trigeminal primary afferent neurons innervating the tongue in vitro as well as the functional impact of stress
on cancer pain behavior and associated peripheral nerve plasticity in vivo. In order to improve outcomes in
HNSCC survivors, there is an urgency to better understand the prevelance of pain and stress in HNSCC
patients, as well as the underlying biological mechanisms."
10868733,"ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but clinical responses remain limited
due to primary and/or acquired ICI resistance. Preliminary studies suggest the gut microbiome is an independent,
novel modulator of systemic and intra-tumoral responses to ICIs. Published studies, primarily in melanoma and
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reported a diverse gut microbiome and a few bacterial species associated
with tumor responses to ICIs. However, existing studies are limited by an oversimplified classification of
responder status and lack of longitudinal analysis. Moreover, specific bacteria or bacterial communities putatively
helpful or harmful to ICI responses have largely been inconsistent across study populations and tumor types with
only limited correlations with immune or mutational biomarkers. To address these inconsistencies, we reanalyzed
raw 16S rRNA amplicon and whole genome sequencing (WGS) fecal data from five published studies (n=303,
pre-treatment stools only) using a high dimensional computational approach and found that our predictive index
underperformed in NSCLC, the leading cause of cancer death, compared to melanoma. Thus, to further refine
this index and identify mechanisms of action for the microbiome in NSCLC ICI therapy, herein, we propose
detailed metabolite (plasma, fecal) and metagenomic (fecal, WGS) longitudinal studies of our NSCLC cohort
(n=108). We will focus our studies on patients with a durable response to ICIs, comparing them to those with
primary resistance (disease progression within 6 months) or acquired resistance (disease progression after an
initial response >6 months). Microbiota metabolite production, with the capacity to impact local and systemic
immune responses, is proposed as a ‘common pathway’ mechanism promoting anti-tumor responses. For
example, both recent literature and our preliminary data in transplantable tumor murine models suggest inosine
and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are microbial modifiers of the tumor microenvironment. Further, a preliminary
study found SCFAs enriched in fecal sample from NSCLC patients with durable response to ICIs (n=11). We
hypothesize that specific bacterial species and/or communities promote production of SCFAs and/or inosine in
the gut and plasma of NSCLC patients who exhibit durable responses to ICI therapy whereas these are absent
in patients who exhibit primary and/or ultimately develop acquired resistance. To test our hypothesis, we propose
to identify fecal and/or plasma metabolites (SA1) and/or microbial taxa (SA2) that correlate with durable response
or ICI resistance in NSCLC patients. We will further test our hypothesis by defining the intra-tumoral immune cell
response to our patient cohorts in syngeneic murine tumor models using single cell RNAseq and paired T cell
receptor sequencing to define T cell repertoires (SA3). Our multidimensional approach, with both cross-sectional
and longitudinal translational analysis, will help define key metabolites and microbes that impact ICI resistance
in NSCLC. These studies will be foundational to my transition to independence as a physician-scientist and will
set the stage for consideration of interventional studies in NSCLC patients."

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) results in substantial costs to society is highly prevalent among adults.
Importantly, the prevalence PTSD within primary care settings is even higher than the general population as
primary care is the setting to which individuals with PTSD most often present. Evidence-based
psychotherapies (EBPs) for PTSD are available but dissemination within real world settings is fraught with
challenges because these therapies require 10-15, lengthy treatment sessions and extensive therapist training
to implement, and these treatments are not feasible within primary care settings given the limited time
resources. Consequently, there are multiple barriers to accessing EBPs for PTSD. Efforts to integrate mental
health services within primary care for PTSD though collaborative care management (CoCM) interventions are
rapidly expanding and have been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However,
the evidence for PTSD is limited due to the time intensive nature of the PTSD therapy approaches that have
been examined. An efficient PTSD treatment approach is needed to address the treatment needs of individuals
with PTSD presenting to primary care. Written exposure therapy (WET) is a brief EBP that provides an
alternative to more intensive EBPs. Recent studies of WET have yielded positive outcomes and have shown it
to be non-inferior when directly compared to more time intensive PTSD EBPs, but WET has not yet been
examined within the primary care environment. The primary aims of the proposed study are to evaluate the
effectiveness and implementation of delivering WET into CoCM to improve the management of PTSD among
underserved primary care patients in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The pragmatic cluster-
randomized study will use a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. Twelve FQHCs will be randomized to
either CoCM plus WET (CoCM+WET) or CoCM alone and 60 patients within each FQHC will be screened for
eligibility. We will use the RE-AIM framework (for Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, &
Maintenance) to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation process of the CoCM+WET intervention using
mixed methods. To examine effectiveness and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention, we will
administer assessments at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up. To assess implementation, we will use clinic
process data and clinic staff interviews pre- and post-intervention. This study has the potential to substantially
impact practice and public health by validating the effectiveness and feasibility of delivering a brief trauma-
focused EBP embedded within CoCM in primary care to improve PTSD outcomes for underserved patients."

We use a geroscience framework to advance Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD) research by
establishing how biological aging affects cognitive and physical decline and defining the role of sleep in these
relationships. We use the interface of aging and breast cancer in older women for this purpose because of their
unique bi-directional relationships. Biological aging processes increase the risk of developing cancer, so that
newly diagnosed breast cancer patients may have accelerated aging prior to therapy. Cancer treatments can
further accelerate aging processes. Despite possible inverse relationships between cancer and ADRD, breast
cancer therapy is associated with short-term cognitive decline and this may be due to the effects of accelerated
biological aging on underlying early ADRD or damage to similar systems as involved in ADRD. As we age, sleep
is fundamental to repairing damage to maintain system regulation and homeostasis, including clearance of waste
products seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Poor sleep is common in cancer survivors and sleep has been
associated with biological aging and/or physical decline and cognitive problems and increased risk for ADRD in
non-cancer settings. However, there is very limited longitudinal research testing these relationships in older
survivors with control groups to inform research into cognitive aging and early ADRD. Our transdisciplinary team
of nationally recognized leaders in aging and cancer, biological aging, sleep, neuroscience, Alzheimer’s disease
and geriatrics are uniquely placed to fill this gap. The proposed study leverages an extant cohort to efficiently
conduct a novel new study of the effects of biological aging on health. Our primary research questions are: 1)
Do breast cancer survivors have more biological aging before systemic treatment than concurrent frequency-
matched non-cancer controls?, 2) Do systemic treatments drive further biological aging and lower cognitive and
physical function in survivors beyond that seen in non-cancer controls over time? and 3) Does poor sleep lead
to more aging and lower function? To address these questions, we begin with breast cancer survivors (N=368)
aged 60+ and contemporaneously evaluated non-cancer controls (N=354) frequency-matched to survivors on
age, racial group, education level and recruitment site. These women have rich pre-treatment/enrollment
neurocognitive, physical and sleep data and blood obtained and banked to specifically test aging markers. We
will conduct follow-up out to 48-months and perform assays of several hallmarks of biological aging (epigenetic
age, DNA damage, cellular senescence, SASP, and leukocyte telomere length). While accelerated biological
aging has been postulated to explain cognitive and functional decline among people with and without cancer,
this rigorous project will be the first to our knowledge to definitively evaluate this theory. The population and
questions proposed are significant and will only become more important with the aging of the population. This
clinical translational project addresses key NIA priority areas and will provide important data to inform future
ADRD studies and interventions to improve health and resilience of our aging population."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder in the world and represents a significant clinical and
societal burden due to related bone fractures. Although classically viewed as an age-related disorder,
osteoporosis now more commonly describes a general condition of low bone mineral density that can arise in
children as well as adults. The mainstay of osteoporosis treatment is anti-resorptive therapy, which seeks to curb
bone resorption. This approach, however, is plagued by undesirable side-effects and concerns regarding long-
term efficacy, particularly in children, underscoring the pressing need for alternative therapeutic targets and
strategies to effectively treat osteoporosis. Plastin-3 (PLS3) is a calcium-sensitive actin-bundling protein that has
recently been linked to the development of childhood-onset osteoporosis; however, the underlying
pathophysiology is completely unknown. This is due in part to the fact that the role of PLS3 in bone health
remains to be identified. This proposal will address these questions and build a basis to develop PLS3 as a novel
anabolic anti-osteoporosis target.
 Genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish models suggest that PLS3 plays a role in osteoblast-mediated bone
formation; however, it remains unclear how PLS3 mechanistically contributes to these processes. Aim 1 will
employ pathogenic PLS3 mutants that are defective in either actin-bundling or calcium-regulation to elucidate
how PLS3 promotes osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in cultured osteoblasts. In addition, RNA-seq
analysis will also be used to identify novel pathways that contribute to mineralization in order to provide insight
to the specific role of PLS3 and actin dynamics in osteoblast mineralization. To better understand how PLS3
contributes to regulation of bone development in vivo, Aim 2 is focused on developing a zebrafish model system
to study the effect of pathogenic PLS3 mutations on bone formation. Taken together, this proposal will fill major
gaps in our understanding of how PLS3 and its regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics contribute to bone
health and the development of osteoporosis.
 The applicant has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentorship team with experts in the actin cytoskeleton,
bone biology, cell biology, and zebrafish model systems that will support the applicant in completion of these
aims. The proposal also takes advantage of the Washington University’s strengths in musculoskeletal and
zebrafish research including the institution’s cutting-edge cores and facilities. Additionally, Washington University
Medical Scientist Training Program has a rich history of supporting physician scientists at various stages of
training that will also be invaluable to the applicant’s development. This training and mentorship will provide the
applicant critical skills that will facilitate the transition to independent researcher and physician-scientist."

We request ongoing support for years 46-50 of our interdisciplinary T32 training program in Molecular and
Integrative Physiological Sciences (MIPS). Supporting 3 predoctoral and 7 postdoctoral trainees, this T32
integrates cellular & molecular biology, physical sciences & engineering, and data science & bioinformatics.
This training program has been highly effective, as evidenced by its 15-year metrics: 66 of 68 T32 trainees
remain in bioscience. Half are women; 10 are underrepresented minorities, URM. Predocs: 18 of 18 graduates
remain in bioscience: 11 went on to postdoctoral training, 1 to MD training, 4 to academics, and 2 to
biotech/health-care. Postdocs: 35 of 37 graduates remain in bioscience: 29 of 37 remain in academics,
including 4 of 5 MDs. Of these graduates, 17 of 37 earned tenure-track faculty status at rank of assistant
professor or higher, 6 of 37 are in biotech or healthcare research, one is in patent law and one in private
medical practice. The rest remain in training. These 17 faculty-level graduates have garnered thus far 9 career
development awards (e.g., ALA, AHA, Parker B. Francis, and others) as well as 6 F awards, 9 K awards, 17 R
awards or equivalent. In 44 years of continuous support, we have never had an unfilled slot. To sustain such a
complex, rich and successful T32 for such an extended period of time, we follow a simple formula: strategic
succession planning, ongoing critical self-evaluation, and continuous scientific reinvention. Accordingly, in the
next 5 years, we propose to: 1) expand our mentoring faculty from 11 to 18, of whom 8 are women; 2)
transition seamlessly to the next leadership team; and 3) revamp our mentoring plan. Through a highly
competitive and rigorous admission process, we select trainees with backgrounds in biology, medicine,
engineering, physics, or data science on the basis of academic record, research potential, and commitment to
interdisciplinary lung research. These trainees work side-by-side on problems at the intersection of pulmonary
sciences and environmental exposures. These themes foster exceptional levels of collaboration among
trainees guided by a faculty with diverse yet highly complementary expertise. For example, again and again
over the years our faculty and trainees have invented transformative technologies that went on to become
widely adopted –from the iron lung decades ago, to Fourier-transform traction microscopy, to single-cell
genome-wide expression profiling using DNA-based barcodes with drop-based microfluidics. As such, our
faculty and trainees remain at the cutting edge of technological innovation because they themselves help to
create that cutting edge. These advances exemplify that the modern research team needs strong grounding in
basic biology, genomics, bioengineering, biophysics, exposure assessment and population sciences, as well
as increasingly sophisticated analyses of big data and bioinformatics. We adopt the approach that the modern
trainee cannot be expected to do it all. Rather, he or she will need the strongest possible disciplinary
foundation together with the tools to work effectively with others outside his or her own discipline."

hesitancy as one of the top-ten threats to global health. Needle-based injections, which increase vaccine
reactogenicity, are a significant driver of vaccine hesitancy. A second fundamental hurdle in equitable
availability of vaccines involves the chain of distribution. Most vaccines must be transported and stored within
a continuous cold-chain to prevent loss of potency, making global distribution challenging. In the face of these
limitations, lineage-directed or other multi-dose strategies involving the sequential delivery of antigens across
weeks or months are receiving increasing scientific interest towards a range of diseases currently lacking
vaccines, yet the issues of global distribution and patient acceptance are exponentially more challenging with
repeated dosing. This project seeks to utilize supramolecular peptide biomaterial vaccines engineered
specifically for the sublingual route to provide for effective vaccination. The project aims to design a shelf-
stable, easily administered, and minimally reactogenic vaccine platform as an alternative to needle-based
vaccines relying on continuous refrigeration. We will build upon the innovative self-assembling peptide
platforms recently introduced by our group and others in order to elucidate factors necessary for maximizing
and adjusting sublingual vaccination responses. In preliminary work, we have established the proof-of-
concept of a tablet-based supramolecular vaccination technology, Supramolecular Immunization with
Peptides SubLingually (SIMPL), but the key design parameters for adjusting the strength and quality of
immune responses remain to be articulated. Therefore the objective of the project is to articulate these design
rules, using multifactorial Design-of-Experiments (DOE) approaches to ascertain how supramolecular size,
charge, mucoadhesivity, and adjuvant complexation influences the lymphatic trafficking and humoral and
cellular responses sublingually in mouse models. Critical proofs-of-concept will be established for influenza,
zika, and HIV-1. Finally, SIMPL will be established as a basis for multi-dose lineage-directed vaccination in
mice and rabbits. Our collaborative team is facilitated by the proximity of the Pratt School of Engineering and
the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI), providing a unique opportunity to combine perspectives from
Bioengineers and biomaterials specialists (Collier lab) and immunologists and vaccine specialists (Fouda lab)."
10813061,"Conformational Control of Protein Kinases
Abstract. Kinase signaling is often oversimplified by focusing only on the downstream phosphorylation networks
catalyzed by protein kinases (PKs). This traditional approach to kinase signaling ignores the noncatalytic
functions that are critical for cellular signaling in both healthy and disease cells. Many PKs contain regulatory
domains (e.g., SH2 and SH3 domains) that function both in tandem with, as well as independent to, the kinase
catalytic domain. The noncatalytic functions of PKs are typically dependent on protein–protein interactions
between the kinase’s multi-domain architecture and an interacting protein (often other kinases or scaffolding
proteins). Moreover, these protein–protein interactions are regulated by large conformational changes to the
quaternary structure of the protein kinase. There is evidence that noncatalytic functions of protein kinases are
essential to cell signaling, however, these functions remain underappreciated due to a lack of genetic and
chemical tools available to study them. Despite the emerging role of noncatalytic kinase signaling, efforts to
understand the importance of kinase conformation on signaling pathways have been hampered by a lack of tools
to assess and modulate the global conformation of PKs.
 During the previously funded period, we developed a ‘selective proteolysis’ methodology to characterize the
quaternary conformation of protein kinases. This method was quickly adopted by academics and the
pharmaceutical industry; however, the method relies on the ability of thermolysin to cleave the SH2-KD linker
within a kinase and not all kinases have this linker with the appropriate recognition sequence. Here, we propose
a cell-based biosensor that reports on kinase conformation. Using our kinase conformation biosensors, we
propose to study the role of protein conformation in single-point mutations that lead to resistance to clinical
kinase inhibitors. In addition to providing information on the conformational impact of drug resistant mutations,
the proposed studies will provide critical information to understand the conformational regulation of Abl, BTK,
BRAF, and EGFR kinases. Finally, we propose to study the interplay of allosteric and ATP-site inhibitors and to
develop multivalent kinase inhibitors for Abl and c-Src kinases. The multivalent inhibitors will be constructed from
matched-conformation allosteric and ATP-site inhibitors. This proposal will develop novel bioassays to study
protein kinase conformation in cellulo, to better understand drug resistance in protein kinases, and to develop
novel inhibitors to study the role of conformation in kinase signaling."
10866541,"Regulation of transcription is central to proper nervous system development and functioning. Dysregulation of
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory pathways are associated with various neurodevelopmental
diseases and disorders including developmental lead (Pb) exposure, which often results in significant and
persistent cognitive and behavioral deficits. We have previously reported Pb-induced methylation changes at
gene promoter regions and effects of Pb on various post-translational histone modifications (PTHMs) in hippo-
campus (HIPP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in animals with Pb-induced cognitive dysfunction, with
sex, amount of Pb exposure, and developmental window of exposure as effect modifiers. While prior work has
focused on effects of Pb on DNA-related mechanisms, an additional molecular transcriptional control
mechanism that has not been studied in this regard is RNA modification. Preliminary data from our lab support
the hypothesis that direct RNA methylation via N6-methyladenosine (m6A/m), may be an important mechanism
contributing to the functionally altered transcriptome after developmental Pb exposure. Direct modifications of
RNA appear to provide an additional layer of control over RNA function for the fine-tuning of transcriptomic
responses to the environment, critical for normal plasticity and memory function. Considering the negative
impact that Pb exposure has on neural plasticity and memory, we suggest that there is a potentially important
role of m6A/m in post-transcriptional regulation of gene-specific responses associated with Pb-induced
plasticity/ memory impairments. Our hypothesis is that this abundant epitranscriptomic mark, m6A/m, not only
plays an important role in modulating memory processes under normal circumstances but is altered by early
Pb exposure with an adverse influence on transcriptional and behavioral responses to Pb. We will test this
hypothesis in the following aims: Aim1: Examine the extent to which transcriptome-wide m6A/m profiles in
mPFC and HIPP CA1 and are altered by developmental Pb exposure in males and females and associated
with expression of memory deficits. Hypothesis: There will be brain region-distinct transcriptome-wide
enrichment profiles of m6A/m (detected by m6A-eCLIP (enhanced UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation),
particularly associated with memory/plasticity-related genes and pathways, that are aberrantly modulated in
Pb-exposed, memory-impaired animals; Aim2: Examine the functional significance of m6A/m modification in
mPFC and CA1 in Pb-exposed animals through manipulation of m6A/m levels. As preliminary data indicate
decreased m6A levels and increased FTO expression in Pb-exposed rats with memory deficits, we will explore
the potential efficacy of viral-mediated targeted knockdown of FTO on Pb-induced memory impairments and
m6A/m levels and memory/plasticity-related gene expression in mPFC and CA1. We hypothesize that by
increasing m6A/m levels we will at least partially ameliorate the Pb-induced memory impairment."

The objective of this project is to identify small non-peptidic molecule modulators of the parathyroid hormone
type 1 receptor (PTHR), a medically important G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulating blood calcium and
phosphate homeostasis, and bone remodeling in response to PTH. Detrimental hypercalcemia caused by excess
of blood PTH level, or polymorphisms of PTHR resulting in receptor hyperactivity, osteoporosis, and hypocalce-
mia caused by defective PTHR signaling, underlie numerous bone and mineral-ion pathologies affecting public
health. Previous support via R01DK-116780 has solved the near-atomic structure of PTHR in complex with Gs
and made discoveries that led us to formulate the hypothesis that integrated computational, and pharmacological
studies, using high-resolution structures of the PTHR and medicinal chemistry methods, may address the chal-
lenge of discovering and developing small molecules capable of allosterically modulating PTHR signaling.
Aim 1 will use a combination of computational approaches, including molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tions coupled to elastic network model (ENM)-based methods, to predict PTHR sites that are simultaneously
druggable and allosteric, and identify small molecules that can potentially serve as allosteric modulators. These
compounds will be iteratively refined and validated with feedback from experiments conducted in Aims 2 and 3.
Aim 2 will characterize and optimize (via synthesis and/or modifications using advanced medicinal chem-
istry methods) the pharmacological profile and cellular impact of these hit compounds by determining the binding,
signaling, and trafficking properties of PTHR in the presence of these compounds. Cell studies will test the func-
tional actions of compounds with most interesting pharmacological profiles on osteoblast mineralization and
expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-a-hydroxylase, rate limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of vitamin D).
Aim 3 will carry out single particle cryo-EM studies to solve the structure of PTHR in complex with Gq,
the G protein that mediates PTH signaling through Ca2+ and PKC signaling pathways. The new structure(s) will
permit us to determine the mechanistic basis by which different G proteins –Gq and Gs– reciprocally couple to
the PTHR. Structural data will be further used for simulating the collective dynamics of the complex and the
mechanism of allosteric communication between the Gq protein and the orthosteric and allosteric ligand-binding
pockets.
 The significance of this research program lies in its first of its kind computational pipeline integrated with
multidisciplinary experimental characterization and validation studies, permitting a precise identification of drug-
gable allosteric sites in the PTHR to identify novel small molecules with potential therapeutic utility for the treat-
ment of bone and mineral ion diseases. Our research may ultimately prove useful to other peptide hormone
GPCRs to identify small molecules as future treatments human diseases."

More than 70 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and development of a vaccine
for HCV is essential for disease eradication. Although direct-acting antivirals are highly effective for treatment,
the majority of countries surveyed are not on track to reach the WHO goal of eliminating HCV as a public health
problem by 2030, with most countries seeing rising incidence of HCV. Fortunately, there is strong evidence that
vaccine-induction of high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs; antibodies capable of neutralizing
diverse HCV variants) could provide protection against human HCV infection. However, we are unable to
stimulate bNAbs against HCV with a vaccine because we have not defined the full spectrum of anti-HCV
antibodies that are critical for neutralizing breadth or characterized the HCV envelope glycoprotein (E1 and E2)
genetic and structural features that favor bNAb selection and maturation. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to isolate a large and representative set of E1E2-specific bNAbs, bNAb unmutated ancestors, and bNAb
intermediates from Elite Neutralizers (EN), individuals with broadly neutralizing plasma and spontaneous
clearance of HCV infection. In Aim 1, we will isolate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from E1E2-specific B cells
isolated from EN and from controls with chronic, persistent infection (CP). We will infer unmutated germline bNAb
ancestors and use B cell receptor-sequencing of longitudinal E1E2-specific B cells to identify bNAb genetic
intermediates. We will compare neutralizing breadth, potency, epitopes, and genetic features for EN vs. CP
mAbs. In Aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM techniques to compare structures of EN bNAbs or
CP mAbs in complex with soluble E2 or E1E2 heterodimers. By comparing mAb-E1E2 interactions among CP
mAbs, bNAb unmutated ancestors, bNAb intermediates, and mature bNAbs, we will define structural and genetic
features of E1E2 necessary for the development of neutralizing breadth. Together, these studies will identify a
large, representative set of bNAbs associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, defining key epitope residues
and structural features in E1E2 that could be stabilized to optimize vaccine antigens. These studies will inform
structure-based design efforts to improve E1E2-based vaccine candidates, which is an urgent challenge with
global public health implications."

 Degeneration of brain or spinal cord neurons is associated with many untreatable neurological disorders
and leads to a gradual decline in cognitive and motor function, and eventual death. While more prevalent in aged
individuals, neurodegenerative disease onset is variable and can begin in childhood. There are no effective
therapies for the majority of patients, likely due to our limited understanding of disease etiology. Inherited
neurodegenerative disorders are commonly caused by genetic mutations in RNA binding proteins that regulate
RNA biogenesis. In order to develop therapeutics for this class of disorders, it will be critical to understand how
RNA binding proteins function in normal and diseased states, and whether molecular changes are amenable to
correction.
 Our preliminary data suggests mRNA processing may be significantly affected in cases of inherited
childhood motor neuron degeneration. To test our hypothesis that mRNA processing defects cause pediatric
motor neuron disease, we have created human stem cell- and animal-based models to correlate molecular
changes with disease pathology. We will apply high-throughput sequencing, electrophysiology, histology and
behavioral approaches to our novel disease models to pinpoint pathogenic transcriptional mRNA isoforms
expressed as a consequence of the RNA binding protein mutation as well as test a candidate targeted gene-
based therapy."
10893985,"The majority of current strategies aiming to prevent, control or eradicate HIV rely on harnessing effector functions
of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, B cells and antibodies to attack HIV and HIV-infected cells. However, natural
killer (NK) cells might represent the ideal subset of antiviral effector cells to promptly and potently respond to
HIV exposure. Classically, NK cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune system that
play critical roles in defense against viral infections, including HIV. Besides their ability to rapidly eliminate virus-
infected cells without the need for prior antigen sensitization, several independent studies from the past 12 years
have demonstrated that subsets of murine, non-human primate (NHP) and human NK cells are capable of
adaptive immune functions, including antigen-specificity and recall responses. Our laboratories provided the first
clear evidence of antigen-specific NK cell memory in a primate species, elicited by HIV/SIV infection and
vaccination. Preliminary data presented in this application now show that antigen-specific NK cell memory with
potent antiviral functions develops upon exposure to HIV in humans and provide the first mechanistic evidence
for antigen-specific NK cell memory, strongly supporting a role for HLA-E and its activating ligand NKG2C in
antigen-specific NK cell responses. Collectively, these findings suggest that antiviral functions of adaptive NK
cells have tremendous potential to be exploited for vaccine design, curative or other therapeutic interventions
against HIV. However, the most significant obstacles to harnessing adaptive NK cell functions is the opacity
surrounding the mechanisms of their formation and their potential to mediate protection in primate species. In
this study, we propose to address the overarching hypothesis that adaptive NK cell responses develop
kinetically to inhibit SIV/HIV replication and use disparate mechanisms of MHC recognition and
alternative epigenetic and metabolic programs through two focused yet independent Aims: (i) Define in vitro
and in vivo mechanisms of MHC-E-restricted NK cell antigen specificity against HIV and SIV infections;
and (ii) Delineate NK cell-specific molecular programs influencing adaptive NK cell formation against
HIV and SIV. Taken together, these investigations will provide critical information on the development of antigen-
specific memory NK cells against SIV/HIV and determine the capacity of this NK cell subset to control viral
replication. If successful, these studies will identify clear pathways that could be exploited to further enhance
adaptive NK cell antiviral activity in future HIV vaccine and/or cure strategies."

Good hearing and cognitive skills are critical to maintaining later-life quality yet decline with advancing age.
Hearing thresholds and cognitive abilities are correlated, and a diagnosis of age-related sensorineural hearing
loss increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. These findings suggest that shared genetic
and environmental factors influence presbycusis, cognitive decline, and dementia risk. We call this the “com-
mon pathway” hypothesis. In our previous study of individuals from randomly selected Mexican American pedi-
grees, we found genetic correlations between hearing and cognitive abilities, providing support for the common
pathway hypothesis. However, the specific common genetic and environmental pathways have yet to be identi-
fied. Here, we propose to measure hearing abilities, cognitive abilities, and putative dementia biomarkers (t-
tau, p-tau, Aβ42/40, and NF-L) in an additional 600 Mexican American participants, increasing our total sample
size to 1,300 and thereby providing sufficient power for further analyses, including identification of specific ge-
netic/environmental risk factors. Our specific aims are (1) to quantify age-related and shared genetic influences
on hearing, cognition, and dementia biomarkers; (2) to interrogate whole-genome sequence data, medical in-
formation, and geospatial data in order to identify specific genetic and environmental influences on these traits;
(3) to provide direct evidence of pleiotropy between hearing loss and dementia risk per se; and (4) to validate
measures of cochlear synaptopathy, a physiological early warning sign of hearing loss that is undetectable via
traditional hearing tests, as phenotypes for future aging studies. Measuring hearing abilities, cognitive abilities,
and dementia biomarkers together in the same individuals may dramatically improve the odds of delineating
specific factors influencing one or more of these crucial aspects of aging. Such discoveries may in turn provide
insights and strategies for increasing the numbers of Americans who successfully age. Drs. Samuel Mathias
and David Glahn at Boston Children’s Hospital and Dr. John Blangero at University of Texas Rio Grande Val-
ley are co-principal investigators on this application. Dr. Amy Garrett at University of Texas Health Science
Center San Antonio will lead a subcontract. Given the wealth of phenotypic, environmental and genetic data
already available in this cohort, the proposed study represents a readily available, cost-effective, and powerful
resource for elucidating the mechanisms of aging."

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by germline loss-of-function
mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Renal disease, which includes angiomyolipomas, cysts, and carcinomas,
is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in TSC.
In unpublished data, we found increased immunosuppressive CD206-positive macrophages and high expression
of the immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3 (a homolog of PD-L1) in human TSC renal cysts and
angiomyolipomas. We also demonstrate that B7-H3 promotes TSC2-null cell growth in vivo via a mechanism
that requires CD8+ T cells.
These and other data lead to our central hypothesis: immunosuppressive macrophages together with B7-H3
expression on TSC2-deficient cells promote renal disease in TSC. A key translational corollary of this
hypothesis is that immunosuppressive macrophages and B7-H3 are potential therapeutic targets for TSC.
Aim 1: To identify the mechanisms through which macrophages contribute to the renal manifestations
of TSC. We will test the hypothesis that immunosuppressive macrophages promote TSC1- and TSC2-deficient
cell growth directly, and/or indirectly via inhibition of CD8+ T cell function.
Aim 2: To determine how B7-H3 remodels the immune microenvironment of TSC-associated renal
disease. We will test the hypothesis that B7-H3 promotes TSC2-null cell growth by inhibiting CD8+ T cell function.
Aim 3: To investigate the preclinical efficacy of co-targeting macrophages and B7-H3 in TSC. We will test
the hypothesis that targeting both immunosuppressive macrophages and B7-H3 will lead to long-lasting, durable
responses in preclinical models of renal disease driven by loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2.
We expect this project to have scientific impact by identifying the immune mechanisms responsible for the
growth of TSC2-null cells in the kidney. These mechanisms may have broad implications, since macrophages
are believed to play a key role in other renal diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD). Our areas of innovation include our novel, translationally relevant hypotheses as well as technical
innovation, including CITE-seq, spatial CODEX and nanoString transcriptomic profiling, and a novel, unpublished
mouse model of renal disease in TSC (Rosa26-CreERT2 Tsc2f/f)."

Despite marked declines, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death
worldwide. Fatal or non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains the initial presentation in at least half of
these patients. In recent years, reflective of the greater understanding of the many diverse causes of myocardial
injury, international consensus definition now includes non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury and several
etiologically distinct subtypes of myocardial injury, including subtypes of MI. However, the basic epidemiology of
MI subtypes and non-ischemic myocardial injury and how risk factors differ between these categories is
conspicuously lacking and critically needed. A fundamental understanding of the epidemiology of myocardial
injury events, including differential relationship of traditional and nontraditional risk factors to the different MI
subtypes, is needed to advance the prediction, prevention, and treatment of these leading causes of death.
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a gender balanced contemporary NHLBI cardiovascular
cohort with extensive baseline participant phenotyping and event surveillance. In this proposal, we aim to
systematically re-adjudicate more than 18,000 clinical events collected in MESA over 14 years. We have
developed innovative tools to enhance accuracy and efficiency of the adjudication process. We will use this data
to ascertain the incidence of specific acute MI subtypes. We will delineate the size and strength of association
between baseline traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors with individual acute MI subtypes and acute
non-ischemic myocardial injury. In addition to analyzing the impact of individual risk factors on specific
myocardial injury subtypes, we will utilize factor analyses to leverage information gained from how multiple risk
factors within a domain (e.g., thrombogenicity, atherosclerosis and myocardial damage) interact with each other
to impact specific myocardial injury subtype.
Successful completion of the proposed study will define the type and frequency of acute MI events in a cohort
representative of the US target prevention population. By first characterizing and quantifying the risk factor
profile, we expect the findings of this project to enable development of more specific individual patient risk
prediction and effective tailoring of prevention efforts (precision medicine). Such knowledge will result in the
evaluation of more judicious application of current therapies—e.g., limiting aggressive anti-thrombotic therapy
for those at greatest risk for Type 1 versus Type 2 MI to maximize benefit and limit risk while more efficiently
utilizing healthcare resources. Furthermore, identification of new risk factors will support exploration of novel
therapeutic avenues that specifically target individual myocardial injury subtypes."

diverse elderly individuals. KHANDLE is one of the largest lifecourse cohorts with diverse racial/ethnic composition and
prospective clinical, lifestyle, and behavioral data from 1964 -present. In Cycle 1, we enrolled 1712 individuals aged 65+
(mean age 76, range 65-103; 60% female) with representation of Blacks, Asians, Latinos, and Whites and 3 assessment
waves. We have completed 2 assessment waves, and Wave 3 will finish May 2021. All waves include comprehensive,
psychometrically sophisticated cognitive outcomes, psychosocial measures such as discrimination, stress, residential
history, a robust clinical protocol to assess prevalent and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD and a 25%
subsample with amyloid PET and MRI imaging. KHANDLE participants encompasses an array of life experiences; 25%
born outside the US, 63% with mothers ≤ high school education, 28% reporting financial problems in childhood, 17%
born in Southern States, and 24.8% cognitive impairment at baseline. In this competitive renewal we extend our studies to
investigate lifecourse factors related to cognitive trajectories, brain imaging changes, and brain donation based
neuropathology with a new focus on sex differences. We will continue investigations of incident ADRD, MCI, vascular
brain injury changes and amyloid PET taking advantage of imaging in Cycle 1 and repeating in Cycle 2. We will enhance
KHANDLE with recruitment of 500 new individuals from diverse backgrounds and will investigate sex differences
leveraging retrospective data to account for selective survival. KHANDLE is uniquely positioned to address timing of
lifecourse exposures and the spectrum of cognitive and cerebropathological aging in a diverse cohort with increased
ADRD incidence and cognitive changes in the next 5 years (mean age 81 at start of Cycle 2). Our aims are: Aim 1:
Evaluate how life experiences, early- midlife health and development of comorbidities influence ADRD incidence and
cognitive trajectories over 9 years. We will use a diverse cohort to evaluate timing of cumulative exposures and will
address racial/ethnic group differences. Aim 2: Examine how lifecourse health impacts amyloid PET and structural MRI
changes and how neuroimaging biomarkers predict cognitive decline in diverse elderly. Aim 3: Investigate sex differences
in ADRD incidence and cognitive decline in a diverse cohort while investigating the role of selective survival and
competing risk of vascular mortality. Aim 4: Initiate a brain donation program for KHANDLE, characterize the spectrum
of neuropathology in a diverse cohort and evaluate predictors of interest, consent, and participation. Findings from
KHANDLE Cycle 2 will uncover mechanisms for reducing disparities in ADRD and cognitive aging."
10903813,"Dry eye is a chronic disruption of ocular surface homeostasis. Evidence is accumulating for tear protein 'lacritin'
and its natural C-terminal proteoforms 'N-94' and 'N-94/C-6' as master regulators of ocular surface homeostasis.
Accordingly, their selective deficiency or absence in dry eye may be viewed as a major risk factor or even cause
of dry eye for which replacement therapy may be a logical treatment approach. Indeed, in NCT03226444, a
recent large multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double masked phase 2 clinical trial, topical N-94/C-
6 significantly restored homeostasis within two weeks in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome dry eye - the most severe
dry eye group. Although we understand in general how lacritin works, many details are missing - most notably
the identity of the signaling receptor, and gaps in proximal and distal signaling. We recently performed unbiased,
genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 death screens. Our death screens identified genes that when disrupted by
sgRNA/Cas9 editing abrogated the capacity of N-94 to restore homeostasis of cultured human corneal (HCE-T)
cells stressed with lethal doses of IFNγ and TNF in an in vitro model of dry eye. Out of 19,114 genes targeted
by 76,441 sgRNA's, with 1,000 controls, GPR87 was the top receptor hit as validated by targeted CRISPR/Cas
9 editing, shRNA knockdown without or with GPR87 cDNA complementation, and syndecan-1 pulldown. GPR87
is expressed in the cornea, shares lacritin signaling mediators (pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein, IP3, calcium,
NFAT), and although considered by some to be deorphanized as a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor, a
recent well-controlled study by others failed to detect specific LPA binding in competition nor functional
experiments. Nor does LPA rescue HCE-T cells. Our working hypothesis is that GPR87 with syndecan-1 are
essential elements of the lacrimal - ocular surface axis. Our immediate goal is to elucidate how GPR87 interacts
with syndecan-1 and both N-94 and N-94/C-6, and explore CRISPR/Cas9 mediator hits to expand our
understanding of lacritin signaling mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to harness this information towards the
effective and lasting treatment of dry eye disease.

10833018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One of the leading causes of visual dysfunction in developed countries is cortical visual impairment (CVI). CVI
is very commonly a comorbidity with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, and significantly
contributes to altered development. CVI occurs when deficits in the eyes alone cannot explain the defects in
perception, indicating that visual processing in the cortex is responsible for altered visual function. No
treatments or effective therapies are currently available. Elucidating the circuitry underlying CVI in
neurodevelopmental disorders will guide in designing targeted treatments not only for visual impairment, but
also to improve other core features of neurological functioning. One neurodevelopmental disorder with high
rates of CVI is CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD). CDD is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by
seizures beginning in the first months of life, severe developmental delay, often including lack of speech and
independent walking. About 75% of individuals with CDD experience CVI and this impairment is also reflected
in mouse models of CDD which have been shown to have reduced visual evoked response and reduced visual
acuity. Although CVI is a prominent feature of CDD, we do not understand how CVI arises and the underlying
circuits. Recently, our laboratory discovered that CDD mouse models exhibit an increased functional callosal
connectivity across cortical hemispheres. Callosal interhemispheric connectivity is key for higher order
processing. In neurotypical development, callosal projection neurons (CPNs) prune their axons from layer 4
pyramidal neurons and refine selective synapses in superficial and deeper cortical layers allowing the
acquisition of adult visual function. Our hypothesis is that in the absence of CDKL5, callosal projections
fail to refine and to acquire proper mature function giving rise to CVI. By combining a multi-level
approach, I will test this working hypothesis in two aims. In aim one I will analyze anatomically the number, cell
type, and distribution of CPNs and their synaptic partners in Cdkl5 knockout mice. Training for this aim will be
provided by imaging core facilities and Dr. Michela Fagiolini who is an expert in visual cortical structure and

Despite the advances in cancer treatment, surgery remains the cornerstone, and more than 80% of cancer
patients have a surgical procedure at some point in their cancer evolution. In oncology surgery, intraoperative
pathology provides surgical guidance and identification of tumor margins, allowing confirmation of complete
tumor resection before oncology surgeons close the surgical wound and helping patients avoid a second tumor
resection surgery. Most localized tumors with negative margin resection show improved patient outcomes and a
lower chance of tumor recurrence. However, the intraoperative frozen section technique suffers from a series of
limitations: tissue loss, compromised quality due to freezing artifacts, suboptimal cutting of fatty specimens, and
inability to diagnose bony lesions.
In our preliminary results, we have developed the 3D contour scanning ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (UV-
PAM) to acquire histology-like images of thick bone specimens, which addresses the long-standing challenge of
intraoperative bone histology. The rapid photoacoustic histology images of bone specimens well match the
conventional histology images stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), allowing pathologists to identify the
cancerous features following existing pattern recognition parameters readily. Although these results showed the
feasibility of intraoperative photoacoustic histology of bone specimens, the system has a relatively slow imaging
speed fundamentally limited by the low laser repetition rate of UV lasers and applies only to only bone specimens.
This research proposal aims to develop a high-throughput photoacoustic histology platform for pathologists and
surgeons to diagnose intraoperatively and remotely with an imaging speed at least 100 times faster than any
published reflection-mode UV-PAM systems.
Specific Aim 1: Develop a structured illumination UV-PAM for ultrafast histology imaging of slide-free
specimens. Aim 1.1. We will develop an ultrafast reflection mode UV-PAM using multifocal illumination with a
single element transducer. Aim 1.2. We will design and fabricate DOEs for structured illumination UV-PAM with
an extended depth of focus for slide-free specimens with irregular surfaces to allow high-throughput imaging of
slide-free specimens in clinical settings.
Specific Aim 2: Implement neural networks for virtual staining of photoacoustic histology and real-time
intraoperative diagnosis. Aim 2.1. We will implement neural networks and unsupervised deep learning
techniques to virtually stain photoacoustic images in various tissue types. The utilization of virtual stained PAM
images for intraoperative diagnostic will be evaluated by pathologists in clinical practices. Aim 2.2. We will
develop and train a deep learning neural network to classify tumor types and stages in different tissues using
photoacoustic histology to build a computer-aided platform for real-time intraoperative diagnosis."
10911044,"Secondary bacterial pneumonias complicating influenza and respiratory viral infections are more severe
than primary pneumonias and often fatal, but why this occurs is unclear. Our data demonstrate that
neutrophils, which are the most abundant white blood cell and critical for fighting bacterial infections, from
influenza-infected animals display impaired ability to ingest and kill bacteria, compared to neutrophils from
uninfected and bacteria-infected animals. To date, neutrophils have been largely considered to be a
homogenous cell population, where the most important factor is whether an infected host has sufficient
numbers of neutrophils to fight infection or not. However, our preliminary data suggest that neutrophils can
adopt different subtypes - for example, our analysis of gene expression patterns of neutrophils isolated from
mouse lung following influenza or Streptococcus pneumoniae infection reveal that neutrophils from virally
infected animals (""flu-PMNs"") significantly differ from neutrophils isolated from bacterially- (S. pneumoniae)
infected animals (""Sp-PMNs""), suggesting that distinct phenotypes of neutrophils emerge in the context of
different types of infection. However, neutrophil specialization is a concept that has been poorly recognized
and understood particularly in the context of infection, although studies from the cancer literature strongly
support this emerging concept. This application tests the hypothesis that neutrophils adopt distinct phenotypes
under conditions of viral (influenza) versus bacterial (S. pneumoniae) pneumonia, which is a mechanism
contributing to secondary bacterial infections. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that type I interferons,
which are a central immune mediator induced by viral infections, lead to the development of the flu-PMN
phenotype. The studies in Aim 1 will examine how viral versus bacterial infections regulate critical neutrophil
functions over time, including phagocytosis, bacterial killing, reactive oxygen species generation, neutrophil
extracellular trap formation, cytokine production, and degranulation responses. In addition, transcriptome
changes in neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow, systemic (spleen), and local (lung) compartments of
influenza versus S. pneumoniae-infected animals to determine where different neutrophil subtypes develop,
and what molecular pathways are activated that might result in different neutrophil phenotypes that emerge
during viral and bacterial infection. Finally, the expression pattern of multiple immune receptors will be
performed using a powerful novel technique, mass cytometry, to determine whether the balance between
activating and inhibitory immune receptors expressed on neutrophils govern changes in neutrophil activities.
Aim 2 will examine the in vivo mechanisms underlying how type I interferons regulate the development of the
flu-PMN phenotype, and investigate the mechanisms underlying the observation that flu-infected animals who
receive neutrophils from bacterially-infected animals have improved ability to fight subsequent bacterial
infection compared to their counterparts who receive neutrophils from virally-infected animals. Inflammatory
responses in the lung will be determined by examining cell counts and differentials, cytokine levels of lung
homogenates over time, and histology. In vivo regulation of phagocytosis and bactericidal activity by
exogenous neutrophil administration will be quantified. The results of these studies will identify neutrophil
subtypes on the basis of deep phenotyping investigations, as well as help us understand how the effects of
type I interferons on neutrophil phenotypes might increase susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia in subjects
with flu infection. These findings will be paradigm-shifting to the field of immunology, which largely considers
neutrophils as a fairly homogenous effector cell population with limited functionality. In addition, the results will
identify new targets that can form the basis for immune regulating therapies aimed at modulating neutrophil
function, instead of simply focusing on whether patients have sufficient numbers of neutrophils."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is clinically and mechanistically heterogeneous. Individual patients present with
variable trajectories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria that may not be concordant
with severity of kidney histopathological injury, reflective of long-term outcomes, or predictive of response to
therapy. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying DKD pathogenesis may help explain differences in
DKD’s clinical presentation and allow implementation of novel personalized diagnostic, prognostic, and
therapeutic strategies. Autophagy, the process by which cytoplasmic components such as damaged organelles
are delivered to lysosomes and degraded, is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis in the kidney
and is a promising mechanism to evaluate in DKD. While kidney autophagy has been studied in extensively in
experimental diabetes models, the role of autophagy in human DKD remains a major knowledge gap.
The overall goal of the project proposed here is to comprehensively characterize autophagy in human DKD
using clinical, histopathological, and molecular phenotyping, establishing a foundation for mechanistically-
targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This project will leverage kidney molecular, clinical, and
histopathologic data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), a longitudinal type 2 diabetes Pima
Indian cohort, and a University of Washington (UW) kidney biopsy cohort. In Aim 1, I will define clinical,
molecular, and histopathological patterns of autophagy in DKD in the KPMP. Specifically, I will compare
markers of autophagy in kidney tissue (autophagosome number assessed via electron microscopy, autophagy-
related gene expression, autophagy-related protein concentrations) between adults with DKD and controls. I
will also investigate associations of kidney autophagy markers with clinical and histopathological features. In
Aim 2, I will test associations of kidney autophagy markers with long-term changes in measured GFR and
albuminuria in the Pima Indian cohort. In Aim 3, I will develop urine and blood biomarker signatures, developed
and internally validated in the KPMP and externally validated in the Pima Indian and UW cohorts.
I aim to establish a career as a physician-scientist with a research focus on DKD and precision medicine. To
accomplish my research and career development goals, I have designed a training plan supported by a team
of mentors and collaborators with expertise in DKD, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and kidney histopathology.
This project will generate novel insights into autophagy in DKD and urine and blood biomarker signatures for
assessing kidney tissue autophagy which can be applied to other cohorts. Improved understanding of
autophagy in DKD may pave the way for molecular-based subgroups with distinct prognoses and responses to
existing and novel therapies."

 Reducing the global burden of low birthweight (LBW) remains a high priority for the World Health
Organization (WHO). In Africa, malaria in pregnancy contributes to approximately 20% of LBW cases and
affects nearly 12 million pregnancies every year. To curb the risk of malaria and LBW in Africa, the WHO
recommends intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp with SP), a malaria
chemoprevention strategy for pregnant women living in malaria-endemic settings. However, over the past two
decades, widespread parasite resistance to SP has called for an urgent need to identify alternative
antimalarials that could replace SP. While several antimalarials have been studied to date, the most promising
candidate appears to be dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Randomized controlled trials from our group and
others have shown DP to be safe in pregnant women and far superior to SP in preventing malaria. Yet, these
studies yield conflicting results on whether DP is superior to SP in preventing LBW. Mediation analyses
conducted by our group confirm that the reason for this paradoxical finding is that SP, an antimalarial with
known antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties, improves LBW through mechanisms independent of its
antimalarial activity (e.g., potentially through preventing sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections,
changing the gut or vaginal microbiome, and reducing maternal inflammation). Moreover, upon further
investigation, the benefits of IPTp with either DP or SP appear to be context-specific, largely driven by the
heterogeneity of the ‘non-malarial’ effects of SP between sites. Thus, in order to inform WHO on the optimal
IPTp regimen, which may require a tailored approach for each setting, further evidence is needed to define the
mechanisms driving the non-malarial effects of SP and for whom and where prevention of the malarial and
‘non-malarial’ mechanisms are most relevant. The objectives of this K99/R00 are to: characterize the
mechanisms that mediate the effect of SP and DP on birthweight (Aim 1), assess the extent to which these
mechanisms and other factors are causing heterogeneity between sites (Aim 2), and develop a model to
estimate which antimalarial combination (either DP, SP, or a combination of DP+SP) would be the most
optimal regimen for each unique epidemiological setting (Aim 3). Our research will leverage existing data from
eight clinical trials conducted across ten study sites. The proposal will build on the applicant’s background in
malaria, clinical trials, and epidemiology and include new training in: (1) the potential ‘non-malarial’ targets of
SP affecting maternal and child health, (2) advanced computational statistics, (3) causal inference methods to
target and tailor interventions. The training plan will be guided by an exemplary mentorship team who are
experts in the field of causal inference, statistics, malaria, and maternal and child health. The combined
research and training plan will competitively position the applicant for a successfully independent research
career as an infectious disease epidemiologist focused on improving global maternal and child health policies."

Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among 10-14-year-olds and the 3rd leading cause of death among
15-24 year-olds in the United States. Reducing adolescent suicide rates is an urgent public health objective.
Insomnia is a robust yet neglected transdiagnostic risk factor for suicidality and suicide deaths in adolescents
that is modifiable using brief, evidence-based behavioral treatments. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge,
insomnia treatments have never been studied in combination with suicide-focused treatments in youths. The
purpose of the proposed research is to conduct an initial feasibility and preliminary effectiveness trial of
combining evidence-based behavioral treatments for insomnia and suicidality/self-harm as a novel approach to
adolescent suicide prevention. We anticipate that augmenting a suicide-focused treatment with an insomnia
treatment will have a synergistic effect and lead to greater reductions in self-harm (SH) behaviors and suicidal
ideation (SI) than suicide-focused treatment alone. We will use dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) as the
suicide-focused treatment for the present study and internet-delivered, digital cognitive-behavioral therapy
(dCBTI) for insomnia as the sleep-focused intervention. We will begin with a small open trial to obtain input
from five youth and their DBT therapists to inform the proposed feasibility trial, adjusting the protocol as
needed to enhance youth engagement in dCBTI. We will then use the modified protocol to conduct a pilot RCT
with 40 youth, ages 12-18, with insomnia and high suicide risk to 6 months dCBTI plus DBT or to DBT alone.
We will assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of dCBTI + DBT, as well as reductions in insomnia symptom
severity, SH, and SI. Following a baseline assessment, insomnia, SI and SH outcomes will be measured every
4 weeks over the 24-week treatment period to allow us to examine time to remission as well as to increase
statistical power and mitigate impact of attrition. Exploratory analyses will examine if reduction in insomnia
symptom severity mediates any observed between-condition differences in SH and SI. To the best of our
knowledge, this will be the first study to explore the effectiveness of combining both an evidence-based
insomnia treatment and a suicide-focused treatment for adolescents. We believe the approach of combining
two existing evidence-based treatments that target risk factors for suicide is innovative and novel, as well as
practical. This approach is consistent with the 2022 NIMH Strategic Plan for Research, Objective 3.2: Develop
strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes. By leveraging existing treatments that we
already know work and have robust uptake in the real world, we reduce time spent on treatment development
and can move faster to dissemination, should the approach prove effective. If dCBTI + DBT is effective, our
goal will be to disseminate dCBTI broadly as an adjunct to any suicide-focused treatment."

Membrane fusion is essential for cell growth, hormone secretion, neurotransmission,
and cell invasion by pathogens. Membrane fusion mechanisms are conserved from
yeast to humans. We have developed yeast vacuole fusion as a model system,
identifying genes for membrane fusion, establishing an in vitro fusion assay with purified
vacuoles, and purifying each relevant protein and lipid for reconstitution into
proteoliposomes which faithfully reconstitute each aspect of fusion. These studies have
revealed novel elements, most recently: 1. A dazzling array of proteins and lipids which
cooperate for orderly lipid bilayer strain and rearrangement, giving fusion without lysis.
2. The assembly of complexes among membrane-bound proteins termed ""SNAREs""
isn't spontaneous, as heretofore believed. Their assembly is actually catalyzed by a
large hexameric complex termed HOPS, which recognizes each of the individual
SNAREs and assembles them in active intermediates, poised for rapid fusion. 3.
Chaperones to the SNAREs, termed NSF/Sec18 and aSNAP/Sec17, which had been
believed to only function to disassemble SNARE complexes after fusion, also promote
fusion. 4. Lipids have a vital and active role in fusion. Each of these mechanistic
insights will be pursued; our goals for the next 5 years are to understand the
intermediates of HOPS-catalyzed SNARE assembly, their structures, the roles of
chaperones Sec17/Sec18, and how these proteins trigger the lipid rearrangements of
fusion. The importance of understanding this pathway is underscored by the central role
of HOPS in the invasion of human cells by pathogenic viruses and bacteria."

In this study we seek to understand how genetic factors influence the risk of developing obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) in Latin American individuals. OCD and related disorders are of major public health importance
owing to their profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about their etiology, and
treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism), genomics has begun to deliver
fundamental knowledge about genetic architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize
pathways altered in disease. We intend to realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing and
diversifying the worldwide sample size for genomic analysis, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental
biology of this condition.
Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will collect the world’s largest ancestrally-
diverse sample of OCD cases (N = 5,000 individuals from Latin America). To do this in an efficient and cost-
effective manner, we will take advantage of a network of OCD clinics we have established across Latin
America, in addition to clinics in the USA and web-based recruitment. The phenotypic data collected will
include a detailed clinical characterization including comorbidities and OCD symptom dimensions. Second, we
will genotype all 5,000 samples on the Illumina Global Screening Array (genotypes for >10,000 matched
controls will be available). This will allow us to, in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
discover genomic loci harboring common variation associated with OCD. Third, we will fine-map genome-wide
significant loci and calculate individual polygenic risk scores (PRS) as a measure of genetic liability to OCD.
We expect the new inclusion of ancestrally diverse samples to improve our fine-mapping ability, to yield more
accurate PRS in non-European samples and ultimately to reduce health disparities when OCD genomic
findings are used clinically. Overall, this study will improve our understanding of the causal mechanisms
implicated in OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and societal costs."
10827966,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Older Americans are a growing segment of the population with an increasing need for surgical services, and
they suffer a disproportionate burden of postoperative complications compared to their younger counterparts.
There are opportunities to reduce risk and improve surgical care delivery for this vulnerable population.
Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment (pCGA) optimizes multiple chronic conditions and factors
commonly overlooked in routine preoperative planning, including physical function, polypharmacy, nutrition,
cognition, mental health, and social/environmental support; pCGA has been shown to decrease postoperative
morbidity, mortality and length of stay in a variety of surgical specialties. Although national guidelines recommend
the use of pCGA, a paucity of strategic guidance for implementation limits its uptake to a few academic centers.
Systems-engineering and implementation science offer unique tools to reliably improve effective use of this
important intervention. The goal of this proposal is to use systems-based engineering methods to tailor and pilot
test a user-centered implementation package for the pCGA – one that can be adapted to community-based
hospitals in preparation for a multi-site implementation trial. This work will promote equitable access to the pCGA,
preserving effectiveness, protecting healthcare resources, and preventing avoidable morbidity and mortality.
This goal aligns with the National Institute on Aging’s strategic vision C3 to “Support the development of
behavioral interventions based on principles of basic behavioral and social science and designed with an eye to
real-world implementation, in line with the NIH Stage Model.”
My long-term goal is to improve surgical care for older adults through transdisciplinary research that promotes
implementation and dissemination of effective, evidence-based, patient-oriented interventions. This 5-year K23
proposal will provide me with mentored research experience and formal training in implementation science,
systems-engineering, clinical trials and aging research. With my strong background in surgical health services
research, I am well positioned to conduct this project and transition to research independence, with the support
of a team of expert mentors at an institution with an outstanding research environment.
The proposed research aims are to: 1) Map the pCGA process and identify system-based barriers and facilitators
to its use among older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery 2) Co-design an implementation package for
the pCGA applicable to a diverse population of older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at (2a) a
large academic hospital and (2b) an affiliate community site, and 3) Test and refine the pCGA implementation
package in preparation for a future randomized controlled implementation-effectiveness trial. Upon completion
of this project, I will have an adaptable, user-centered implementation package for pCGA with preliminary pilot
data on implementation and effectiveness, which will serve as the basis for an R01 proposal to conduct a multi-
site hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trial of the pCGA in older adults undergoing abdominal surgery."
10773197,"Overview. Human fMRI and LFP recording studies suggest that the anterior insula encodes the salience of
stimuli and deviations from expectations. However, BOLD signals and LFPs have insufficient resolution to assess
how these codes are distributed across insular cells. Moreover, the origin and functional relevance of insular
codes is unclear. We will address these questions with multi-site single unit and LFP recordings as well as
optogenetic methods in rats. Critically, our pilot data indicates that presentation of salient stimuli elicits identical
LFP responses in rats and humans: bursts of high amplitude beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations.
Significance and approach. Because its volume is reduced in most psychiatric disorders, the insula is a
promising therapeutic target for transcranial or deep brain stimulation. However, progress in this field has been
hindered by a lack of high-resolution data about insula signaling. Thus, this proposal may facilitate the
development of novel therapies. To study the insula in rats, we developed a novel reinforcement learning task
that features a behavioral readout of the rats’ expectations (and their violations). This task will allow us to assess
how anterior insula neurons and their synaptic partners encode multiple variables and probe their role in learning.
Aim #1 Characterize the coding properties of neurons in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners.
We will perform multi-site unit and LFP recordings in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners. This will allow
us to: (1) test whether cells at these various sites encode outcome valence, magnitude, salience, and deviations
from expectations; (2) test whether valenced stimuli elicit bursts of beta oscillations in the anterior insula, as seen
in humans; (3) compare the entrainment of neurons at these various sites by oscillations of different frequencies;
(4) test whether the amplitude of insular beta bursts tracks stimulus salience and deviations from expectations.
Aim #2: Determine which inputs drive coding of different variables in anterior insula neurons. The data
obtained in Aim 1 will suggest which inputs convey information about different variables to insula neurons. Similar
hypotheses will arise regarding the origin and propagation of insular beta bursts. To test these hypotheses, we
will infuse AAVs driving the expression of an inhibitory opsin in projection-defined cell types. Then, we will inhibit
the candidate cell types and assess how these manipulations affect the coding properties of insula neurons as
well as the genesis and propagation of insular beta bursts.
Aim #3 Test whether reducing or enhancing insular beta bursts impairs or facilitates learning. We will
achieve real-time control over insular beta bursts by combining optogenetics with programmable multi-channel
signal processors, giving us unprecedented control over fast neuronal events. We will enhance or dampen
insular beta bursts by delivering low-intensity light stimuli that bias spike times in or out-of-phase with respect to
beta oscillations, without altering firing rates. If insular beta bursts facilitate learning, up- or down-regulating them
should respectively accelerate or slow down learning in the task."

Current at-home COVID tests are not accessible to people with low vision or blindness. To interpret results,
people with low vision or blindness may need a sighted assistant, an internet-based image recognition tool, or
some other sort of powered implement. Instead of adapting to technologies developed for sighted people, we
propose a new platform which provides a no-power tactile readout, i.e., a texture change, to interpret test results.
Although COVID antigens are at relatively low concentrations in human saliva, by relying on surface chemistry
effects, a relatively small amount of sample can be designed to cause a significant texture change. This project
will develop a new class of antibody-conjugated polymers which, in a saliva sample, bind to COVID antigen. In
conjunction, we will also develop a test surface designed to maximize tactile feedback upon antigen binding.
Upon binding to the test surface, a COVID positive surface will feel distinctive from the negative control, like
distinguishing between plastic and glass. To optimize polymer design and test surface design, we use a
combination of materials characterization, mechanical testing, human testing, and computational techniques.
The project culminates by having low vision or blind users test the device with synthetic saliva solutions
containing COVID antigen, present as innocuous protein isolates. Subjects will receive synthetic saliva with and
without COVID antigen, and using our platform, will be asked to determine if the synthetic saliva did contain the
COVID antigen. As a platform, the technology is not limited to COVID, but could be adapted to either new variants
or other use cases, such as pregnancy tests. Our team's expertise combines accessibility experts, synthetic
chemists, human psychophysics, computational simulations, surface science, and mechanics. To maximize
project success, the project includes people with visual impairments at all stages to ensure practicality."

cell immunology with her subsequent clinical and research fellowships in cardiovascular medicine at the Brigham
and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). She is currently an Associate Physician in
the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and an Instructor in Medicine at BWH/HMS.
Coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. While endothelial
dysfunction is known as a precursor to atherosclerosis, how altered endothelial metabolism contributes to
atherogenesis remains incompletely understood. The principal investigator’s long-term goal is to define how local
immune activation alters endothelial metabolism and contributes to atherogenesis. As a first step toward
achieving this goal, she recently discovered that interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a T-cell cytokine abundant in human
atheroma, impairs endothelial glucose metabolism and activates fatty acid oxidation in primary human coronary
artery endothelial cells (Lee et al., Circulation, 2021). These metabolic derangements were associated with
proatherogenic endothelial phenotypic changes, raising the central hypothesis that IFN-γ-induced endothelial
metabolic reprogramming forms a novel mechanistic basis for accelerated atherosclerosis. This hypothesis will
be tested through the following aims: (1) Define the effect of IFN-γ on endothelial fuel utilization, (2) Establish
the mechanistic link between endothelial metabolic reprogramming and endothelial phenotypic changes, and (3)
Define the changes in endothelial metabolism in a mouse model of immune exacerbated atherosclerosis in vivo.
Using the cutting-edge approaches including metabolomics, vascular phenotyping, single-cell technology, and a
mouse model of atherosclerosis, the principal investigator will acquire new skills and expertise in quantitative
analyses of metabolism, lipid biology, and in vivo analysis of immune-endothelial interaction in experimental
atherosclerosis. These studies, if successful, will establish immune mediated endothelial metabolic perturbations
as a novel mechanistic basis for linking pathologic T-cell activation and atherosclerosis and may open new
therapeutic strategies. Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, a distinguished vascular biologist with expertise in vascular
metabolism, redox biochemistry, and systems biology will serve as the principal investigator’s primary research
mentor. An advisory committee of physician-scientist experts in cellular metabolism and atherosclerosis research
will provide further scientific and professional development guidance and assessment of her progress. In
summary, Dr. Lee has created a superb environment and mentoring team to develop her unique niche in immune
modulation of endothelial metabolism. The proposed research, training plans, and outstanding environment at
BWH, HMS, and MIT will propel her transition to an independent investigator and a leader in vascular research."

Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to
revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and
functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To
realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques.
Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a
naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune
system.
The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and
understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of
immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These
will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform
for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic
hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using
deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell
lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data,
combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human
immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties.
These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more
rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of
immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by
these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and
statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have
algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties.
Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and
identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy."
10883680,"HBCD-NC Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
