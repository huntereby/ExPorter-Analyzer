The quality of early language interactions with parents and caregivers in early childhood has long-term
implications for a child’s social, economic, and physical heath. Differences in the home language environment
(HLE) are well established and cross all sociodemographic characteristics, although disparities
disproportionately affect infants and toddlers growing up in under-resourced communities. Although several
decades of research have identified evidence-based strategies that enhance the HLE and improve child
outcomes, they have failed to reduce population-level disparities in child language development and long-term
outcomes. The study proposed here utilizes Talk With Me Baby (TWMB) as a novel tool to increase language-
building interactions between parent/caregiver and child. Because TWMB is delivered in the primary care
setting (which reaches up to 98% of families with infants and toddlers), it is scalable, low-cost, and universal.
With TWMB, healthcare providers can embed evidence-based language promotion into their well-child care
(WCC) anticipatory guidance for all children age 0-3 years. TWMB builds on decades of well-controlled
language intervention efficacy trials and has been deployed clinically for 8+ years. Here we propose a type 1
hybrid effectiveness implementation trial to measure the impact of TWMB on gains in the HLE and subsequent
child language outcomes. The trial is both randomized and controlled across 2 sites: a TWMB intervention
group (8 clinics) and a care-as-usual control group (8 clinics). In TWMB clinics, providers and care teams will
be trained to deliver TWMB during all 2-24 month WCC visits. Across TWMB and control clinics, we will enroll
25 parent-child dyads in each clinic (n=400 total) prior to their 2-month WCC visit and follow them through their
24-month WCC visit. For Aim 1, we will measure the impact of TWMB on the HLE and child language
development using Language Environment Analysis (LENA, “talk pedometer” recordings), home video
recordings of parent-child interactions during daily routines, and standardized child language measures
(including parent-report and direct assessments that are available in English and Spanish). For Aim 2, we will
examine characteristics that moderate the efficacy of the language promotion intervention (TWMB) for families,
including family strengths and sociodemographic characteristics. We will also examine HLE dosage and parent
language promotion knowledge as mediators of child language outcomes. For Aim 3, guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we will use a mixed methods approach to
examine factors relevant for TWMB implementation. Providers and care team members will complete validated
surveys to assess the constructs of feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness, and then participate in semi-
structured interviews to provide qualitative data. We expect successful completion of these aims will result in
knowledge that will change the standard of pediatric well-child care to include systematic universal language
promotion that can optimize the developmental potential of all young children."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally treated with chemotherapy, which only achieves incomplete
response. Relapsed disease has no new treatment options and the long-term outcomes are poor. The central
premise of our proposal is that the TNBC’s survival dependency on high glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) functions, elevated NADPH and GSH levels, and aberrantly-active
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, which are adaptation mechanisms, makes them
therapeutically vulnerable to two chemotypes: R001, R002, and H182, H333. R001/R002 (natural products)
moderated the high G6PD, TrxR1, and STAT3 functions, thereby decreased GSH levels, and induced gene
expression changes, while H182/H333 (azetidine-based) potently and selectively inhibited STAT3 activity and
gene expression in TNBC cells. The collective inhibition of the high G6PD, TrxR1, STAT3 and GSH functions
and gene expression changes led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) build-up in TNBC cells, DNA damage, cell
cycle arrests, cell death, and tumor growth inhibition in vivo of TNBC models. Though indeed, G6PD, TrxR1 or
STAT3 knockdown alone led to ROS build up in TNBC cells, and RNAseq profiling showed STAT3 inhibition
alone led to enrichment for the genes in the DNA damage, ER stress response, UPR, and senescence pathways
in H182-treated TNBC cells, we anticipate differences between the chemotypes’ activities, which we seek to
define in order to better tailor these compounds for TNBC treatment. Normal cells, which have low background
G6PD, TrxR1, NADPH, GSH, and STAT3 functions are unaffected. We hypothesize that the moderation of the
redox/metabolic events and gene regulation through the targeting of G6PD, TrxR1, and STAT3 by R001, R002,
H182 and H333 inhibits TNBC growth. We further hypothesize that the compounds’ effects on the metabolic,
redox and STAT3 pathways in non-tumor cells in the TME contribute to the antitumor response. We will define
the differences between the chemotypes. 1. Investigate the interactions of STAT3, G6PD, and TrxR1 with the
compounds in vitro to define their inhibition modes; 2. Study how the specific targeting of STAT3 by the azetidines
and the modulation of G6PD, TrxR1 and STAT3 functions by natural products differ in the downstream changes
in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that feed into NADPH and GSH levels and in gene
expression in vitro and in vivo; 3. Investigate ROS induction and the associated stress response, DNA damage,
cell cycle changes and cell death, their molecular regulators, including oxidoreductases in TNBC cells and tumor
tissues following treatment; and 4. Investigate the antitumor responses to the inhibitors in vivo in CDX, PDX,
4T1/Balb-c, and E0771/BL6 models. We will gain new, indept insights into TNBC’s dependence on dysregulated
G6PD, TrxR1 NADPH, GSH and STAT3 functions and the preferential effects of inhibitors. X-ray crystallographic
studies will give atomic level details into the direct interactions. The successful development of R001, R002 or
H182, H333 and their combination therapy with ICI will provide a novel effective treatment for TNBC."
10882648,"Summary
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) describe a continuum of ethanol-induced developmental defects with
jaw defects being common. Genetic risk factors lie at the heart of FASD and are major drivers of FASD etiology,
providing insight into the cellular and molecular processes potentially disrupted in FASD. However, we know little
of these processes. From our studies in zebrafish, we have established an in vivo model for FASD where
mutations in the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (Bmp) and Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathways
sensitize embryos to ethanol-induced jaw defects by disrupting the cell behaviors driving tissue morphogenesis
during jaw development. Jaw formation involves complex signaling interactions between the neural crest and
the anterior pharyngeal endoderm (anterior PE). Critical to these interactions, anterior PE morphogenesis
requires Bmp- and PCP-dependent actin-based cell movements, polarity and adhesion. Bmp signaling is
required for endodermal E-cadherin localization and PCP receptor expression while PCP regulates cell polarity
and adhesion. Mutations in the Bmp and PCP pathways sensitize embryos to ethanol-induced malformations of
the anterior PE and jaw. Work in mouse liver indicates that ethanol reduces Bmp signaling at the level of the
receptors. Altogether, this suggests that an ethanol-sensitive, Bmp-PCP signaling cascade contributes to
anterior PE morphogenesis. Yet, how ethanol modulates the Bmp and PCP pathways and their crosstalk,
disrupting anterior PE morphogenesis remain unknown. We hypothesize that ethanol attenuates Bmp signaling
there by decreasing PCP component expression levels and disrupting actin dynamics, cell polarity, adhesion
and migration during anterior PE morphogenesis. Using a unique combination of zebrafish-based approaches,
we will test our hypothesis in the following aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will a) analyze an ethanol dose response
on total and phosphorylated Bmp receptor and Smad proteins, b) use scRNA-seq to examine endoderm-specific
gene expression changes of Bmp and, downstream of Bmp, PCP genes, and c) test the epistasis of the Bmp-
PCP signaling axis on jaw development. In Specific Aim 2, we will use 4D-confocal analysis in control and
ethanol-treated Bmp and PCP mutants to quantify ethanol-induced disruptions to a) cell velocity, coherence, and
persistence of migration and resulting changes to size and shape of the anterior PE and b) actin polarization and
cellular protrusion dynamics. In Specific Aim 3, we will a) quantify shape and polarity and b) analyze E-cadherin
gene expression as well as E-cadherin and PCP protein localization in anterior PE cells of control and ethanol-
treated Bmp, PCP and Bmp-PCP compound mutants. We will also c) quantify ethanol-induced jaw defects in
Bmp- and PCP-E-cadherin compound mutants. Overall, this work will greatly advance our understanding of the
cell behaviors and molecular mechanisms driving ethanol-induced structural malformations and provide concrete
signatures to pursue predictive, diagnostic, and novel therapeutic approaches to FASD."

Abstract
We have shown that DNRAb, antibodies that cross-react with DNA and N-methyl D-aspartate
receptor, cause cognitive impairment when they penetrate the hippocampus. The neural injury
proceeds in two stages. First, there is excitotoxic neuronal death; second, there is microglial
activation and dendritic loss in surviving neurons. Microglial suppression by angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition restores neuronal integrity and cognitive function. We
propose now to study the mechanism of microglial activation and dendritic loss and the
mechanism of action of ACE inhibition. These studies have the potential to suggest additional
therapeutic targets for ameliorating cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric lupus."
10886085,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Project 2
The African American populations on whom the proposed Research Project (RP) 2 and broader P50 Center
focus are disproportionately exposed to social adversities, hardships that take a toll on individuals’ biological,
neurocognitive, and behavioral systems. During the transition to adulthood, this toll manifests in escalating
rates of addictive behavior, including drug use and unhealthy eating. A scientific consensus is emerging that
exposure to social adversity and other stressors during childhood and adolescence can promote both drug use
and cardiometabolic vulnerabilities through cumulative effects “under the skin”, including dysregulation of the
neuroimmune network (NIN). Despite exposure to chronic stress, however, many African American youth and
young adults do not evince NIN dysregulation and vulnerability to drug use and other forms of addictive
behavior. In a series of proof-of-principle studies sponsored by our P30 Center, we investigated the long-term
effects of participation at age 11 in the Strong African American Families (SAAF) program on individuals when
they were transitioning to adulthood (ages 19-25). A number of additional benefits from participation became
apparent, many of which involved modifying processes linked to those specified in the NIN framework (i.e.,
prefrontal-limbic connectivity, limbic region structures, inflammation, and cardiometabolic health). Although
provocative findings, data on inflammation and neural activity were collected post hoc, and these findings must
be regarded as preliminary until a more rigorous study is performed. The proposed RP2 is designed to meet
this need by conducting a randomized controlled trial of the SAAF program (N = 300 low-income families) in
which youth will participate in an fMRI assessment and blood draw to index NIN-related neural systems and
peripheral inflammation at baseline and a long-term follow-up (2 years). Psychosocial measures from parents
and youth will also be conducted at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. Our specific aims are to test
hypotheses regarding: (1) the influence of participation in SAAF on change in NIN-associated risk markers
(neural circuitry subserving threat, reward, and executive control, as well as peripheral inflammation) across 2
years; (2) the mediating role of protective parenting in linking SAAF participation to NIN-associated risk
markers; (3) the influence of SAAF on change in addictive behavior vulnerabilities associated with emotion
regulation, risky decision making, early-onset substance use, unhealthy eating, and cardiometabolic risk
markers; and (4) the mediational chain linking SAAF to addictive behavior vulnerabilities via changes in
parenting and NIN-associated risk markers. Testing the experimental effects of SAAF on NIN-specified
vulnerability factors with pretest and follow-up fMRI and inflammation assessments represents a dramatic step
forward in prevention science, and we hope that RP2 will provide a template for future investigations of drug
use prevention programs."
10886087,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Project 3
We propose Research Project 3 (RP3) in the context of a P50 Research Center of Excellence: The Center for
Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS). CTAPS has been funded continuously since 2003
(P20MH068666; P30DA027827) to advance next-generation basic and preventive investigations of risk,
resilience, and drug use among African American young people living in resource-poor communities in the
southeastern US. Informed by advances that NIDA neuroscientists have made, we recently expanded our
program to consider the influence of social adversity on the consumption of high fat/high sugar foods, which
also can be considered an addictive behavior, co-opting many of the same neural circuitries as does drug
abuse. Understanding the development and prevention of addictive behavior vulnerabilities has significant
implications for preventing both drug abuse and cardiometabolic disease. The proposed P50 is designed to
transform scientific understanding regarding the etiology and prevention of addictive behavior by testing
hypotheses suggested by a neuroimmune network (NIN) model that, in concert with familial and contextual
factors, contributes to the development of drug use, unhealthy eating habits, and cardiometabolic health
problems. In RP3, we focus on rural African American families in Georgia in which poverty and unemployment
rates are among the highest in the nation. The parents in these families have grown up taking part in the
Strong African American Families Healthy Adolescent/Adult Project (SHAPE; R01HD030588). In RP3, we
propose to leverage the SHAPE sample to test hypotheses regarding how addictive behavior vulnerabilities are
transmitted across generations. We propose to investigate multigenerational risk and resilience pathways
linking chronic SES- and race-related stress, parenting behavior, and risk factors suggested by the NIN model
to preadolescent children’s addictive behavior vulnerability and cardiometabolic risk. We will combine extant
data on grandparents and parents, data currently being collected from parents that R01HD030588 is funding,
and collection of new data from parents and children that this proposal will support. Our first aim is to
investigate the risk pathways through which SES- and race-related stress exposure across generations affects
children’s addictive behavior vulnerabilities and cardiometabolic health. Our primary endpoints are children’s
(~age 11) addictive behavior vulnerabilities and cardiometabolic health. We hypothesize that exposure to
SES- and race-related stressors promotes a chain of processes generations that affects children’s
vulnerabilities to addictive behavior and their cardiometabolic health. The mechanisms through which SES-
and race-related stress promote children’s addictive behavior vulnerability and cardiometabolic risk include (a)
use of harsh, unsupportive parenting practices and, (b) NIN risk factors (inflammation and behavior- and
emotion-regulation difficulties suggested by the NIN model), and (c) addictive behavior (parents’ use of alcohol,
nicotine, and other drugs, as well as their unhealthy eating."
10886089,"Summary/Abstract 
The goal of Project 1 is to establish that a botanical supplement provides resilience against stress-induced 
pathophysiological responses that confer susceptibility to depressive behavior. This proposal will investigate 
how polyphenol metabolites of a bioactive dietary polyphenol preparation (BDPP) engage biomolecular and 
genetic targets in microglia, medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and blood brain barrier (BBB) cells to promote 
resilience of neuronal function and behavior in response to stress. Recent studies show that dysfunctional 
immune activity confers susceptibility to stress by affecting activity of these aforementioned cells. Systemic 
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-6 (IL-6), by stress is observed in model 
systems of depression, as well as in patients with MDD. From preliminary studies involving a validated model 
of social stress, we show persistent IL-6 expression from leukocytes affects the BBB function only in stress- 
susceptible mice. We present evidence that BDPP bioavailable metabolites may promote resilience to social 
stress by suppressing production of cytokines, which is associated with maintenance of BBB integrity. Our first 
goal is therefore to establish if BDPP provides resilience against stress-induced depression by targeting 
mechanisms associated with BBB function. This aim will determine whether a botanical supplement prevents 
BBB permeability and infiltration of peripheral immune factors through the neuroendothelium, and will 
characterize biomolecular targets of BDPP metabolites in endothelial cells. Our preliminary studies show 
BDPP supplementation suppresses stress-induced microglia hyper-ramification and upregulation of 
inflammatory genes, which are associated with stress-susceptibility. Our second goal is to conduct an 
unbiased screen to identify molecular bioactivities of BDPP metabolites in microglia in response to stress. 
This aim involves a cell-specific RNA-sequencing technique termed translating ribosomal affinity purification 
(TRAP). Moreover, Aim 2 will characterize how increased activity of toll/nod-like receptors in microglia confer 
susceptibility to stress-induced depression, and act as proximate biological targets for BDPP metabolites. 
Finally, we show how BDPP metabolites prevent maladaptive glutamatergic synapse generation in the NAc in 
response to stress by regulating expression of synaptic genes in MSNs. We also show that peripheral IL-6 
production by peripheral leukocytes in response to stress is critical for facilitating aberrant synapse formation in 
the NAc. The final goal will therefore be to conduct an unbiased screen to identify molecular bioactivities of 
BDPP metabolites in D2 MSNs using the TRAP method and to investigate if peripheral IL-6 diffusion into the 
brain activates microglia via the IL-6R to effect regulation of NAc synapse densities. This would provide a 
mechanism for why suppression of peripheral IL-6 by a botanical supplement can promote resilient behaviors 
for a future clinical trial. Together, Project 1 will validate that pathophysiological responses associated with 
IL-6 can be suppressed by a botanical supplement to promote resilience to stress."
10886090,"Project Summary/Abstract 
Stress is a leading risk factor for a multitude of the most prevalent mental health illnesses worldwide, including 
major depressive disorder (MDD). Current treatments fall short of what is required to meet the ever increasing 
disease burden and opportunity cost. In addition, current treatment paradigms fail to alleviate underlying 
pathophysiologies and a significant percentage of patients become refractory to treatment. The purpose of 
Research Project 2 is to investigate whether a well-characterized polyphenol enrich botanical supplement can 
provide an alternative approach to suppress the pathological effects of stress that increase an individual's 
susceptibility to developing certain psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that 
susceptibility to stress is a function of both central and peripheral immune activity. In particular, select 
inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6, have recently been recognized as key mechanistic 
contributory factors of stress-induced anxiety and depression. Supporting this principle are clinical 
observations that show that a subset of patients with treatment-resistant depression exhibit increased 
expression of IL-6 in the plasma. We show in a model system of stress-induced depression that specific 
bioavailable metabolites of our botanical supplement suppress stress-induced production of IL-6 from 
leukocytes and, further, provide resilience to stress-induced psychological impairment. Therefore, the first 
objective of Research Project 2 will be to thoroughly the pharmacokinetic and steady state properties of our 
botanical supplement to confirm that the bioactive compounds that were found to modulate IL-6 expression in 
rodents are also bioavailable and reach a bioactive concentration in humans. We will conduct a double blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled (untreated control), dose ranging study in healthy volunteers using a low dose, 
intermediate dose, and high dose of BDPP, based upon our work with animals and from the scientific literature. 
Project 2 then investigate the association between metabolites of our botanical supplement and the expression 
of inflammatory cytokines in healthy subjects. Our proposed experiments will then characterize whether BDPP 
metabolites prevent upregulation of IL-6 in response to the Trier Social Stress Test: a well-validated model of 
psychological stress. Moreover, by integrating a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) statistical 
method we can determine which metabolite, or combination of metabolites, may be responsible for 
suppressing IL-6 in a clinical setting in response to stress. Objectives from Research Project 2 will inform a 
future clinical trial by providing guidance on the optimal product dose, treatment timing, outcome markers of 
bioavailability; will verify metabolites that suppress IL-6 expression are present at bioactive concentrations in 
plasma, and establish whether anti-inflammatory properties of BDPP observed in model systems of stress- 
induced depression can be recapitulated in a clinical model of stress."

The purpose of Research Core B is to support the overall effort of the ODS/NCCIH U19 Botanical Dietary 
Supplement Research Center (BDSRC) in two specific areas: (1) by centralizing the procurement, 
characterization, archiving, quality control and shelf-life/stability assessment of polyphenolic materials used by 
individual Research Projects; and (2) by centralizing bioanalytical support for all Center Research Projects and 
Cores. Our previous studies have demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of dietary supplementation from a 
combination of grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE), Concord grape juice (CGJ), and resveratrol (RSV) in 
promoting preservation of cognitive wellness and psychological resiliency under select stress conditions. We 
have also shown that specific metabolites extracted from these botanicals can be detected in blood and brain 
tissue. We can detect methylated and/or glucuronidated derivatives of the various classes of flavonoids 
(flavan-3-ols such as catechin and epicatechin; anthocyanins (cyanidin and malvidin); flavonols (quercetin); 
stilbenes (resveratrol)). Core B will be responsible for the identification and quantitation of the parent 
compounds and derived metabolites in animal and human biological fluids and tissues, using various analytical 
techniques including liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to different mass spectrometric (MS) techniques, e.g. 
high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS/MS), 
1D nuclear magenetic resonance (NMR) techniques including 1H NMR and 13C NMR, and various 2D NMR 
techniques including 1H-1H TOCSY (total correlated spectroscopy), 1H-1H NOESY (nuclear Overhauser 
enhancement spectroscopy), gradient enhanced 1H-1H COSY (correlated spectroscopy), 1H-13C HSQC 
(heteronuclear single quantum coherence), and 1H-13C HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond coherence), and 
LC-NMR as needed. In addition to these bioavailability and PK studies, Core B will also serve as an archived 
repository of all botanical materials, standards and polyphenolic compounds used throughout the Center, 
maintain tracking of all samples using a LIMS system, and perform quality control analyses and stability testing 
in support of this function. The complementary nature of the expertise of the individual investigators within 
Core B creates a strong synergistic team capable of supporting individual Research Projects and collaborative 
efforts focused on achieving U19 BDSRC objectives."

The Administrative - Biostatistics/Data Management Core A of this Botanical Dietary Supplement Research 
Center (BDSRC) has a two tier plan. The Administrative Tier I Plan Component is divided into three broad 
categories: scientific, academic, and organizational. The components of the administrative core will provide the 
day-to-day management of the BDSRC and will facilitate interactions within and between the participating 
research groups at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the external participating institutions. The 
organizational support provided by the Administrative Tier I Plan Component of this Core will operate through 
three “Work Groups” and will manage all administrative issues of the BDSRC, including scientific affairs, 
contractual agreements, allocation of funds/fiscal issues, personnel related issues, and fostering of new 
research. Overall the Work Groups in the Administrative Tier I Plan Component will be regulated by an Internal 
Steering Committee (ISC) composed of Research Project and Core Leaders to assess research progress and 
determine whether research goals are being met. The Administrative Tier I Plan Component of Core A will also 
be responsible for the creation and management of an External Advisory Committee (EAC) designed to 
provide oversight and assist the PD/PIs in making scientific and administrative decisions. In parallel, the 
Biostatistics/Data Management Tier II Plan Component is organized into one Work Group: Biostatistics and 
Data Management Work Group, which provide statistical support for all BDSRC Research Projects and Cores. 
While all of the BDSRC investigators are well versed in the statistical approaches that are applicable to their 
specific hypotheses and projects, Core A will provide statistical expertise, state-of-the-art analysis, and storage 
for all data sets, allowing integration of each Project's data with the data derived from the other Projects. The 
Tier II Plan Component has access to a data warehouse system that has recently been developed within Mount 
Sinai's Scientific Computing facility. This system will be available to each Research Project and Core for data 
integration/storage and data query through web interface. The integration of cross-project data for statistical 
analysis will not only be aided by the data management system described, but also through statistical testing of

inception."
10886007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite high efficacy, oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has had limited population impact on HIV incidence
in the US, in part because of challenges with pill-taking. Bimonthly injections of cabotegravir were recently
found to have superior efficacy to daily oral PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender
women, and cisgender women. Long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP could mitigate barriers to adherence and
persistence, thereby increasing PrEP coverage. Interest in LAI PrEP has been high in some groups that are at
disproportionately high risk of HIV infection and underrepresented among oral PrEP users, including Black
women and Black and Latino MSM, suggesting that LAI PrEP could also reduce racial, ethnic, and gender
inequities in PrEP use. However, barriers to LAI PrEP use may be more common in underserved communities,
potentially exacerbating inequities. LAI PrEP may also increase risk of drug resistance due to its long half-life
or delayed detection of HIV infections. This risk may be mitigated by an oral PrEP ramp-down phase or viral
load testing during use, but the feasibility and impact of these strategies are unknown. Robust evidence on
early use and outcomes of LAI PrEP is needed to design implementation strategies to minimize HIV infections,
inequities in use, and drug resistance. Large-scale oral PrEP studies have historically relied on prescription
data, with limited ability to evaluate key determinants (e.g., race), barriers to use, or clinical outcomes.
Research in healthcare systems can combine the breadth of electronic health record (EHR) data with the depth
of qualitative studies to guide efficient and equitable implementation of PrEP. Our study, Cabotegravir PrEP:
Actionable Robust Evidence for Translation into Practice (CABARET), will evaluate real-world use,
population impact, and optimal investment of resources to facilitate the implementation of LAI PrEP. The
settings are 3 racially and ethnically diverse regions of Kaiser Permanente—Northern California, Mid-Atlantic
(DC, Virginia, Maryland), and Georgia—serving 5.6 million members and 13,000 PrEP users. Aim 1 will extract
and analyze EHR data to evaluate LAI PrEP uptake and persistence, including racial and ethnic inequities in
use, and HIV incidence and drug resistance. Focus groups with providers and potential, current, and former
LAI PrEP users will explore facilitators and barriers to LAI PrEP prescribing and use, with oversampling of
Black women and Black and Latino MSM. Aim 2 will use mathematical modeling parameterized with EHR data
to estimate the 10-year impact of LAI PrEP on HIV incidence, inequities in incidence, and drug resistance. Aim
3 will use economic decision modeling to determine the cost and effectiveness features that LAI PrEP uptake
and persistence interventions must have to be prioritized in an efficient and equitable HIV-prevention strategy.
A stakeholder advisory group will inform study design, interpretation, and dissemination to maximize impact.
This study will produce a body of evidence to guide the translation of LAI PrEP into practice, with research
infrastructure that can integrate new PrEP products as they emerge."
10886008,"The RDoC Positive Valence Systems (PVS) encompass motivational processes underlying normal reward-
guided behavior and its alterations in many mental disorders. Yet, the theoretical links between the PVS
constructs of Reward Responsiveness, Learning, and Valuation remain under-specified. Hence, our goal is to
unify them under a new model of computational reinforcement learning with momentum dynamics wherein
momentum reflects whether recent outcomes have generally exceeded or fallen short of our expectations,
signaling an improving or worsening reward rate. Momentum is closely linked with mood and our model offers
new insights into the interplay of mood and reward learning. Thus, we are seeking to provide a mechanistic
account of transdiagnostic mood dynamics and affective instability (AI), a dimension of psychopathology seen
in depression, anxiety, eating and personality disorders, and suicidal behavior. While ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) studies of AI have shown how mood changes over time in mental illness, to date we have
no formal model that can explain why it changes thus. On the other hand, lab-based experimental studies have
used tools from cognitive neuroscience to explore potential neural mechanisms of affective instability. Though
promising, lab studies are too brief to capture the temporal dynamics of AI in psychopathology, which typically
unfold over hours or days. Here, we overcome the limitations of EMA and laboratory studies to date by bringing
together key elements of both within a framework grounded in reinforcement learning and dynamical systems
theory. To this end, we will combine mood tracking with learning experiments carried out in daily life over 4
weeks, concurrently recording neurophysiological signals via wearable heart rate and electroencephalography
sensors. We have shown that this platform captures the behavioral and physiological effects of positive and
negative outcomes, and that physiological learning signals predict day-to-day changes in subjects’ mood. We
will use this platform to examine PVS constructs and AI in individuals sampled from the community (Sample 1,
n = 300) and in a clinical sample of individuals with borderline personality (Sample 2, n = 150) recruited from
two ongoing studies in Pittsburgh and State College, PA. In our earlier study, mood induction that impacted
reward valuation also impacted striatal reward responsiveness. Here, we will investigate the cortico-striatal
substrates of momentum dynamics in relation to real-life mood fluctuations by combining mobile longitudinal
assessment with model-based fMRI. During the scan, subjects will choose between experimental stimuli they
previously encountered in different moods. This will allow us to examine how mood impacts neural valuation
and learning signals and how learning signals shape future mood. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise in
computational modeling of mood and its integration with EMA, physiology and imaging (Eldar), computational
model-augmented functional imaging and EMA in clinical populations (Dombrovski, Hallquist), and
neuroimaging methods (Hallquist)."
10886047,"Project Summary / Abstract
A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro
cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also
happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the
initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly
documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish
the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis
Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating
systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and
cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian
development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression
changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting”
(VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high-
resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated,
including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied
to pathways relevant to mammalian development."

Prospective memory impairment in Parkinson disease-related cognitive decline: Intervention and mechanisms
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) – one of the Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) – is associated with increased disability, mortality and healthcare costs among people with PD. The long term goal of this research is to reduce disability and delay the onset of the ADRD PDD by enabling people at risk for PDD to cope with cognitive decline to maintain daily function. Existing medical (e.g. surgical, pharmacological) treatments for PD do not prevent or treat cognitive impairment, so behavioral interventions that mitigate its negative functional consequences and potentially delay or slow PDD are a top research priority. Unfortunately, the widely-used process training approach to cognitive intervention (repetitive practice of tasks designed to challenge and improve particular cognitive functions) has been unsuccessful in improving daily function and quality of life in this population. To overcome this limitation, the investigators take a strategy training approach, teaching targeted strategies that people can use in their everyday lives to circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish daily tasks. Strategy training is a practice standard for cognitive rehabilitation in brain injury and stroke, but its application to PDD is novel. Moreover, the strategy training intervention developed for this study explicitly focuses on generalization of training to daily function, an aspect that is critically lacking from many typical strategy training approaches and from PD-related cognitive intervention research to date. This project addresses prospective memory, or the ability to remember to execute delayed intentions at the appropriate moment in the future. Good prospective memory is essential for independent living (e.g. paying bills, turning the stove off), employment, social relationships, and compliance with important health behaviors (e.g. taking medications). People at risk for PDD have prospective memory deficits that relate to worse daily function and quality of life. Therefore, prospective memory impairment is a relevant cognitive problem to address in this population. The primary objective of the current project is to determine the efficacy of mechanistically-targeted strategy training on prospective memory among people at risk for PDD (those with PD-related mild cognitive impairment; PD-MCI). It is a single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of strategy training to the traditional process training approach on objective laboratory prospective memory performance (Aim 1) and reported everyday prospective memory function (Aim 2). Additional objectives are to investigate neural mechanisms of prospective memory impairment in PD-MCI (Aim 3) and neural and behavioral predictors of prospective memory training response (Aim 4). This project leverages participants, data and infrastructure from an existing longitudinal cohort of PD, PD-MCI, PDD and control participants to evaluate short-term and long-term training effects, neurobiological mechanisms, and predictors of treatment response. This work will meet the pressing need for effective cognitive interventions that delay functional impairment associated with the ADRD PDD and will positively impact function and quality of life in this population."

 Zinc is an essential nutrient that profoundly affects human health, since ~10% of the proteome binds zinc.
A key to zinc homeostasis is storage during times of excess and release during periods of deficiency.
Lysosomes, which have a well-established role in the degradation of macromolecules, are emerging as a
conserved site of zinc storage. How lysosomes integrate the dual functions of zinc storage and degradation is
not well defined. Our data indicate that lysosomes mediate these dual functions in separate compartments.
 We used C. elegans to demonstrate excess zinc is stored in lysosomes of intestinal cells; CDF-2 (ZnT2 in
mammals) is the SLC30 family transporter that loads zinc into lysosomes, and ZIPT-2.3 is the SLC39 family
transporter that releases zinc. Reciprocal regulation of CDF-2 and ZIPT-2.3 regulates the direction of zinc flow;
in excess zinc, CDF-2 is upregulated to increase storage and ZIPT-2.3 is downregulated to decrease release.
 How do lysosomes rapidly change the composition of transporters on their surface? Using super-resolution
microscopy, we discovered that lysosomes have an expansion compartment connected to the acidified central
compartment. The expansion compartment is contracted in zinc-replete conditions, but grows dramatically in
response to high zinc. Our overall hypothesis is that the expansion compartment allows the rapid delivery of
CDF-2 to lysosomes to promote zinc homeostasis –without disturbing degradative processes in the acidified
compartment. This hypothesis is innovative, since we only observed the expansion compartment with the
recent availability of super-resolution microscopy. To determine if this mechanism is conserved, we examined
lysosome dynamics in mammalian cells; the ZnT2 zinc transporter alters its localization on lysosomes in
response to high zinc, consistent with lysosome remodeling. To test the predictions of our model, we will
characterize the molecular nature of the compartment, identify transcriptional changes during assembly and
disassembly, and validate our findings in mammalian cells.
Specific Aim 1, First, we will use TEM to determine whether lysosomes have a second membrane-bound
compartment that contains CDF-2. Second, we will use X-ray fluorescence microscopy to test whether zinc is
sequestered in this structure.
Specific Aim 2, we will extend these findings to mammalian cells. We will test whether the ZnT2 transporter is
required to store zinc, identify the ZIP protein that releases zinc, and test whether these transporters are
reciprocally regulated to remodel lysosomes.
Specific Aim 3, we will analyze the regulation of lysosome remodeling. We demonstrated that the lysosome
biogenesis regulator HLH-30 (TFEB in mammals) is required for remodeling. We will determine how the
transcriptional response to high zinc mediates lysosome remodeling. These studies will have a major impact by
defining a new aspect of lysosome biology that is critical for zinc homeostasis."
10930151,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Although tobacco use has declined in developed nations in recent decades, smoking prevalence
remains strikingly high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Lao People's Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR), 51% of adult men and 7% of adult women smoke tobacco. The development and
evaluation of sustainable tobacco cessation interventions suitable for widespread adoption in nations such as
Lao PDR are pressing public health needs. To address this need, we propose a project that adapts our
theoretically and empirically based mobile health (mHealth) technology to help people quit smoking cigarettes
in Lao PDR. This mHealth approach includes a fully automated, interactive, personalized, smartphone-
delivered intervention for behavioral treatment, delivered through our Insight™ platform. mHealth interventions
are proliferating in developed countries, but efforts to utilize similar approaches in Lao PDR are extremely
limited. The World Health Organization acknowledges that using mHealth for health promotion is cost-effective,
scalable, and sustainable, including for the least-developed countries. Additionally, text-messaging
interventions for smoking cessation have been shown to be effective, cost-effective, and affordable for tobacco
control globally. We have already developed the mHealth platform and intervention approach proposed for this
study and pilot tested this technology with a group of Cambodian smokers. Preliminary results demonstrated
that our mHealth technology is efficacious, highly feasible, appropriate, and potentially scalable for LMIC
settings. This proposed project for Lao PDR includes 2 main phases. In the R21 Phase, we will use formative
research methods to adapt our intervention content to the sociocultural context, language, and communication
styles of Laotians. In the subsequent R33 Phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
evaluate the efficacy of our mHealth intervention and technology. Adult smokers of both sexes will be recruited
through 2 large hospitals: Setthathirath Hospital in Vientiane and Champasak Hospital in Champasak
Province. Participants (n=500) will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: Standard Care (SC; n=250) or
Automated Treatment (AT; n=250). SC consists of brief advice to quit smoking delivered by research staff, self-
help written materials, and a 2-week supply of NRT (transdermal patches). AT consists of all SC components
plus a fully automated smartphone-based treatment program that involves interactive and personalized
proactive messages, images, or videos. The primary health outcome of the trial is biochemically confirmed self-
reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence 12 months post study enrollment. The project also aims to
advance mHealth research capacity in Lao PDR and sustain the US-Lao PDR research network. The project
has the potential to transform healthcare services for tobacco cessation treatment throughout the country and,
ultimately, to significantly reduce tobacco-induced morbidity and mortality."

Cardiac Energy consumption is the central determinant of cardiac function. Its impairment is the
hallmark of heart failure (HF), which accounts for nearly $40 billion in medical costs every year
and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization. In HF pathophysiology, the depression of
contractile force of the myocardium is not matched by a concomitant depression of energy
consumption. This results in the uncoupling between mechanical contraction and energy
expenditure of the heart, which drives systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the heart. Thus, the
detection of early alterations in cardiac energetics in HF patients can provide critical information
on heart health and guide novel therapeutic interventions for HF which are under development.
Since the heart relies almost exclusively on aerobic oxidation, the gold standard for staging
alterations in cardiac energetics is from invasively measured whole heart myocardial oxygen
consumption (MVO2). However, invasive catheterization is not a practical way for repeat
surveillance of the disease in the suspect population or the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.
Hence there is an unmet need for a noninvasive approach that can enable repeatable
quantitative assessment of cardiac energetics. Significant effort has been made towards
developing noninvasive techniques for MVO2 measurement, particularly based on positron
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, they have
not made it into the clinical arena due to major technical/practical limitations. An alternative
approach, which overcomes key limitations of PET and longstanding technical challenges of
MRS for estimating MVO2, employs magnetic resonance oximetry. Nonetheless, this requires
simultaneous and reliable mapping of quantitative MR parameters in the rapidly moving
coronary sinus, which is nearly impossible for the CMR techniques today. Here, we propose to
develop and validate a single, fast, free-breathing, motion-insensitive acquisition to
simultaneously derive coronary sinus oxygen saturation and myocardial blood flow for MVO2
measurement. We will test the developed method in detecting the impaired cardiac energy
consumption level in an animal model with heart failure. The proposed method is expected to
quantify cardiac energy consumption noninvasively, without ionizing radiation, and exogenous
contrast agents. Accordingly, forming the foundation toward (1) early detection and classification
of HF for target treatments, (2) prognosis of HF without invasive procedures, and (3) longitudinal
monitoring of HF progression to guide the development of novel HF therapies."

Safeguarding privacy of data assets – while simultaneously facilitating data sharing and
exchange – is paramount to sustaining the value creation of genomics for precision
medicine and population health. One of the most significant challenges for Xia-Gibbs
Syndrome (XGS) research and rare disease studies in general is the lack of integrated,
privacy-preserving platforms to facilitate efficient patient recruitment and data sharing.
Rare disease datasets are fragmented, incomplete, and sparse. These barriers to data
accessibility prevent efficient data aggregation, translation to clinical benefits, and disease
promotion to the global patient and scientific communities. Without data sharing
mechanisms that align incentives while preserving security and privacy, fragmented and
siloed data will severely limit the value of genomic medicine in the future.
We aim to address these issues by designing and developing components enabling a
computationally feasible privacy-preserving rare disease community engagement platform,
emphasizing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles.
Specifically, we will deploy innovative cryptography technologies in the context of a web
application streamlining interaction, data exchange, and analysis between patients,
advocacy groups, researchers, and therapeutic developers. Building on our current secure,
HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, in Phase I of this fast-track proposal we will onboard our
existing XGS Registry to establish proof-of-concept while ensuring the platform is readily
generalizable to other rare diseases. In Phase II, as we onboard two additional rare disease
communities, we will implement software optimizations and GPU-acceleration to ensure the
platform can scale to a data privacy- and ownership-preserving engagement platform and
registry applicable to all rare disease communities and datasets.
Ultimately, the approaches developed here will allow researchers and therapeutic
developers expanded ability to search for and retrieve essential patient data for rare disease
research. We anticipate the creation of such a tool will accelerate the growth of rare disease
registries worldwide, creating positive externalities benefitting the entire industry by
enabling widespread access to previously inaccessible data."
10887530,"Most stroke survivors walk slowly and are at an increased risk of falls. As a result, many adopt a
sedentary lifestyle with limited functional independence that negatively impacts health and can be socially
isolating. Physical therapy including advanced rehabilitation techniques have improved function, but there is no
intervention available that enables stroke survivors with moderate and severe impairment to walk at speeds
necessary for independent community ambulation. The long-term goal of this work is to restore stroke
survivors’ ability to walk safely in the community at speeds necessary for independence. Our approach utilizes
an implanted neuroprosthesis, that is a device inside the body that applies small electrical pulses to activate
the nerves that cause the muscles serving multiple joints to contract in a coordinated manner for functional
movement of the entire limb. The system measures volitional muscle activity and body motion and then
coordinates stimulation at the different joints in the leg to produce the necessary movement for safe walking at
functionally relevant speeds. The benefit of such an approach is that it is always available and does not require
setup for individuals with impaired hand control. The implanted hardware also improves reliability and
bypasses sensory fibers that can cause discomfort. Our team has shown in a case study that targeting
muscles throughout the paretic limb can substantially improve walking speed and endurance. This study will
expand this work through achieving the following Aims: 1) determining the clinical impact of an implanted multi-
joint neuroprosthesis on post-stroke gait, and 2) developing and assessing an advanced neuroprosthesis
cooperative control strategy. This study will implement an available neuroprosthesis that incorporates an
external control unit and some external sensors in preparation for implementation of a fully implanted system
that has been developed at our Center. Six participants will be implanted with devices that include 12-channels
of stimulation and 2-channels for recording muscle activity. External sensors will measure limb motion. After
the device is implanted, stimulation patterns will be generated and participants will undergo training to use the
device. A simple triggering pattern will be created for home use and then we will implement our advanced
controller in the laboratory via machine-learning techniques. Once a controller and stimulation pattern have
been defined, we will determine how much faster, more safely, and easier walking is with the neuroprosthesis
compared to without and confirm whether these effects are maintained over time. We will also determine if the
advanced controller substantially improves walking ability over the simple triggering methods that have been
previously implemented. Successful completion will confirm approaches for a post-stroke neuroprosthesis for
walking and generate preliminary effect sizes for subsequent clinical trials to evaluate home and community
use of a fully implanted system. This study may lead to a new clinical tool that can empower independent
walking after stroke, improve quality of life, and enhance overall health of stroke survivors."
10885709,"Project Summary: A lack of coordination between Medicare and Medicaid services creates a fragmented care
system for dually eligible beneficiaries and can increase their risk for poor health outcomes. Dually eligible
individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are exceptionally vulnerable under this
fragmented care system. They often need extensive acute care (paid by Medicare) and long-term care (paid by
Medicaid) but experience functional and cognitive declines, which compound the challenges of navigating the
complex, bifurcated systems of Medicare and Medicaid.
 Integrating Medicaid-paid long-term care into Medicare services (termed “long-term care integration”
hereafter) can improve care coordination for dually eligible individuals with ADRD. Under long-term care
integration, people receive Medicaid-paid long-term care and Medicare services from the same insurance
company. In this case, the single company bears financial risk for both Medicare services and Medicaid long-
term care and is therefore incentivized to coordinate Medicare services and Medicaid long-term care.
 A common mechanism for long-term care integration is the dual-eligible special needs plan (D-SNP).
Long-term care integration occurs through D-SNPs in two ways. First, some D-SNPs bear financial risk for both
Medicare services and Medicaid long-term care (which we refer to as “single-capitated D-SNPs”). Second,
people can receive Medicare services from a D-SNP and long-term care from a separate managed care plan,
both of which are operated by the same parent insurance company (which we refer to as “aligned D-SNP”).
 D-SNPs is a significant force in long-term care integration, with substantial increases in enrollments in
single-capitated or aligned D-SNPs over the past decade. Recognizing their importance, Congress
permanently authorized and refined the utilization of the D-SNP for long-term care integration in 2018.
However, this rapid adoption of the D-SNP for long-term care integration lacks rigorous empirical evidence.
 Our long-term goal is to provide a rigorous empirical evaluation of single-capitated and aligned D-
SNPs, ultimately supporting evidence-based policies that can improve outcomes for dually eligible individuals
with ADRD. Leveraging 2018-2024 Medicare claims linked with Medicaid claims, this proposal will adopt a
staggered difference-in-differences approach to obtain the causal effects of single-capitated and aligned D-
SNPs on key outcomes. We will accomplish three aims. First, we assess the effect of single-capitated D-SNPs.
Second, we assess the effect of aligned D-SNPs and compare the effect of aligned vs single-capitated D-
SNPs. Third, we assess the effect of aligned D-SNPs by plan characteristics.
 As an increasing number of dually eligible individuals continue to enroll in single-capitated or aligned D-
SNPs, our study will provide urgently needed information about the effects of single-capitated and aligned D-
SNPs for dually eligible individuals with ADRD."
10884163,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death, affecting more than 30 million people in the U.S., with one in four
individuals over 65 years suffering from its debilitating symptoms. Economically, diabetes represents an
enormous burden due to associated healthcare cost and loss of productivity. Insulin is the most effective
treatment used by many diabetic patients. However, achieving euglycemic balance can be a challenge since
therapeutic insulin often leads to unintended sharp drop in blood glucose level, causing severe hypoglycemia
which, if not addressed, may result in coma and death. Frequent hypoglycemia is one of the most reliable
predictor of malignant disease course and mortality in diabetes. Normally, hypoglycemia is averted by
counterregulary response pathway in the brain, which coordinates a series of physiological measures, along with
hunger, to restore blood glucose. However, recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, due to intensive insulin therapy
and daily activities, impairs these brain pathways, leaving diabetic patients vulnerable to subsequent
hypoglycemia. Efforts to identify the central counterregulatory pathways revealed essential role of brainstem
catecholamine neurons. We and others have shown that these neurons project extensively to hypothalamus,
and these projections are essential for their counterregulatory actions. However, hypothalamic target(s) of these
neurons and the mechanism(s) underlying their impairment by repeated hypoglycemia has not been determined.
The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neural circuit(s) mediating counterregulatory actions of
brainstem catecholamine neurons. The aims of this grant are to 1) determine the direct neuronal target(s) of
medullary catecholamine neurons in the hypothalamus mediating counterregulation, and 2) determine how
repeated hypoglycemic episodes desensitize communication in this pathway. To accomplish these aims, we will
use axons of medullary catecholamine neurons as a map to downstream circuits. These studies will provide new
fundamental insights into the central counterregulatory pathways. In addition, by identifying mechanism of
impaired counterregulation, these studies may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of
hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure and hypoglycemia unawareness."
10884164,"Neural circuits underlying the acquisition and control of motor skills
Much of our behavioral repertoire consists of learned motor skills, yet little is known about the neural circuits underlying
their acquisition and control. The overarching goals of our research program is to identify these circuits, delineate their
respective functions, and explain the logic by which they work together to implement motor skill learning and execution.
To work towards this goal, we developed cutting-edge experimental infrastructure designed to enable high-throughout
and rigorous studies of complex learned behaviors in rodents. To facilitate the study of learned motor skills, we developed
a task that train rats to produce task-specific movement patterns with complex learned movement kinematics. In previous
work, we showed that motor cortex is necessary for learning these skills, but not for executing them once acquired. These
surprising results suggest that, while motor cortex has a function in learning, the acquired skills are stored and generated
subcortically. We further showed that the sensorimotor input region of the basal ganglia, the dorsolateral striatum,
encodes the kinematic details of the learned motor skills and is essential for generating them. Here, we build on these
results to examine the logic and mechanisms by which subcortical circuits, specifically the striatum and thalamus,
contribute to acquiring, storing, and generating these skills. To get at this, we will use our innovative experimental
platform to monitor neural activity and behavior continuously over weeks of training, while also perturbing neural activity
and observe the effects of these manipulations on behavior. We will describe how striatal encoding of task-related
movement patterns changes with learning and how these changes relate to a striatum’s putative control function (Aim 1).
We will further parse the pathways from thalamus to striatum that are relevant for motor skill execution (Aim 2) and
describe task-related activity patterns in the thalamus and how they are transformed in the striatum (Aim 3). Precise
measurement of the rats’ movements using video-based motion tracking will relate our neural recordings and circuit
manipulations to behavior in exact ways, allowing us to infer how subcortical circuits implement the acquisition and
execution of learned skills. Addressing these aims will clarify the logic of how the mammalian motor system enables motor
skill learning and execution and delineate the roles of the basal ganglia and thalamus in these important processes, thus
addressing fundamental questions in neuroscience with far-reaching implications for clinical practice and
neurorehabilitation."
10873153,"ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable brain disorder that currently debilitates more than five million
people in the United States alone. Clinically, AD typically presents as a slow and progressive decline in
cognitive performance that inevitably culminates in severe dementia. Currently AD can only be positively
confirmed postmortem by dementia with amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
containing the hyper-phosphorylated Tau protein. It is generally accepted that plaques and tangles play
important and complex roles in AD. The prevailing model of AD pathogenesis has been that changes in Aβ
metabolism precipitate a damaging cascade upstream of tau pathology and eventual neurodegeneration.
However, there is a lot about these enigmatic pathological marks that we do not understand. The relevance of
Aβ and amyloid plaques in AD has seen a recent resurgence in FDA approvals and activities. For example, the
FDA recently approved aducanumab that can remove amyloid plaques as measured by positron-emission
tomography. Although the importance of the amyloid plaques in AD have long been recognized, exactly how
plaques develop over time, the extent of their diversity, and their relation to toxic or homeostatic response of
the surrounding neuronal circuits remains unclear. Therefore, it is of great importance to map the trajectory of
distinct classes of amyloid aggregates during the early stages of A pathology.
 We have recently discovered several important and early events in the formation of A plaques in AD
model brains and have developed several new approaches to study these processes. First, we discovered that
impaired protein homeostasis in axon terminals represents a pioneering synaptic defect in amyloid model mice.
Second, we found that the synaptic vesicle release and recycling machinery has selectively hampered turnover
through plaque dependent and independent mechanisms. Third, formation of structurally distinct plaques are
associated with differential Aβ peptide deposition. Finally, Aβ42 comprises the initial core structure followed by
radial outgrowth and later incorporation of Aβ38. To rigorously extend these findings, in Aim 1 we will obtain a
dynamic map of amyloid plaque pathology in mouse model brains during aging. The goal of Aim 2 is to
determine how the AD risk factor Trem2 influences A, lipid, and protein dynamics at amyloid plaques. In Aim
3, we will integrate the multi-omic amyloid maps with measures of altered synaptic communication and
neurotoxicity. Finally, in Aim 4, we apply the knowledge gained in a practical manner with 3D mapping for the
neuroscience research community. The proposed research will advance our understanding of AD by
determining when Aβ is aggregating in the extracellular space, what structural Aβ assemblies are formed, and
how these oligomers and plaques trigger mechanisms leading to downstream synaptic dysfunction."
10873272,"PROJECT SUMMARY-ABSTRACT
 The understanding of normal cognitive function and the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases
have been enabled by the study of natural products and their synthetic congeners. The extensive discoveries made in this
realm have been limited primarily to the specific activities of abundantly available natural products or simple derivatives
thereof. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop laboratory routes to complex molecules that act on proteins
associated with neurological disease.
This proposal outlines approaches to limonoids that act on PTP1B and mitigate neuronal dysfunction. Departing
from conventional strategies using second- and third-row metals, this proposal describes the development of first-row metal
catalyzed transformations to empower laboratory routes to complex molecules that contain heterocycles. This state-of-the-
art approach to multistep synthesis will result in broadly useful chemical transformations for carbon-carbon bond formation,
and highly step-efficient routes to access complex small molecules. Powerful medicinal chemistry approaches will be used
to make deep-seated structural modifications to limonoids, which will be used to interrogate molecular mechanisms of
action.
 Novel analogs produced by these routes will be used to evaluate small molecule inhibition of PTP1B, which has
been implicated in neurodegeneration. Through structure activity relationship studies and investigations into the binding
mechanism on a molecular level, the therapeutic potential of PTP1B inhibition to improve neurodegeneration will be readily
investigated."

 Chagas disease is a leading but poorly-understood infectious cause of heart failure, resulting from infection
with Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. T. cruzi has a worldwide prevalence of 7 million, with over 300,000 infected
individuals in the United States. Chagas disease causes a significant burden on health care and the economy
of over $7 billion annually in total costs. No vaccines are available, and current treatment options are limited by
significant adverse effects, long treatment duration, and poor efficacy in late-stage disease. New treatment
options for Chagas disease have therefore been identified as a research priority by the World Health
Organization, the World Heart Federation, and the Inter-American Society of Cardiology. Our work has
identified L-carnitine as a novel treatment regimen for acute and chronic T. cruzi infection, able to improve
readouts of cardiac damage and disease severity, and with a good safety profile alone and in combination with
the antiparasitic standard-of-care benznidazole. L-carnitine has high potential for clinical translatability, being
affordable, readily available, and already FDA-approved to treat inborn metabolic disorders. However, the
mechanism of action of L-carnitine in chronic T. cruzi infection is currently unknown. The overall objective of
this proposal is to elucidate this mechanism of action, enabling in the long-term continued development of L-
carnitine into clinical implementation, and the identification of new alternative treatment regimens for Chagas
disease. L-carnitine differs from classic antiparasitic agents in that it improves T. cruzi infection outcomes
without reducing parasite load. Thus, results will also expand our understanding of Chagas disease
pathogenesis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that L-carnitine’s mechanism of action is mediated by
lessening cardiac fatty acid oxidation, increasing cardiac glucose metabolism, and lowering infection-induced
cardiac contractile impairment. This central hypothesis will be tested in experimental models of chronic T. cruzi
infection, using three complementary yet independent aims. We will combine metabolomic and
pharmacological analyses of the impact of L-carnitine on fatty acid oxidation (aim 1) and on glucose oxidation
(aim 2) with echocardiographic analyses of the impact of L-carnitine treatment on cardiac contractility (aim 3).
The proposed research is innovative because it centers around a new candidate treatment regimen for Chagas
disease with novel mechanism of action, and it will lead to the identification of additional avenues for Chagas
disease treatment. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to a rigorous understanding of L-
carnitine’s mechanism of action, facilitating its progression to the clinic, and will identify novel candidates for
further Chagas disease drug development. Overall, this work will provide valuable new translational
avenues for Chagas disease treatment, as well as significant fundamental insight into cardiac Chagas
disease pathogenesis."
10873843,"Our broad goal is to train a generation of investigators with programs of basic, translational or clinical research in movement disorders. Movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, and ataxia strip away the ability to act on our environment. Each disease causes unwanted movements, makes desired movements more difficult to perform, and also affects how we think and process our emotions. To be effective, research into movement disorders must cross disciplines, and enhance the translation of basic science discoveries to help humans move more effectively. This T32 program confronts this problem head on by bringing together an outstanding group of mentors and predoctoral trainees to foster interdisciplinary training in movement disorders across the disciplines of genetics and molecular biology, translational neuroscience and physiology, and cognitive and movement science. To achieve this goal, we have designed our training program as follows. First, six trainees are selected from a pool of outstanding predoctoral students with diverse backgrounds and are admitted from one of six participating graduate programs for up to two-years of support. Second, we have created built in mechanisms via which trainees interact including: a) monthly T32 meetings with the program directors and a biostatistician where trainees present and discuss their research; b) development of a joint research project as part of a required Movement Disorders course using one of several available large scale ‘movement disorder” databases; c) annual chalk-talk symposium between the T32 Trainees and Neurology Fellows from the UF Center for Movement Disorders. Third, the trainee's doctoral committee includes a biostatistician and faculty mentors who represent at least 2 of the 3 themes of the training program. Fourth, trainees take a required clinical-lab rotation course where they shadow clinicians, view DBS surgery, and rotate through clinical and basic science laboratories outside their core area of expertise. To enhance rigor, we have incorporated a biostatistician into our program along with specific training activities. Other core requirements include development of an individual career development plan, T32-specific courses, publications and presentations at professional and scientific conferences (including the NINDS workshop), and career development and networking opportunities. The Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration (MDNR) training program capitalizes on existing clinical and research strengths of faculty of the Fixel Institute and the Center for Movement Disorders and six affiliated centers of excellence (Parkinson Disease, Tourette, dystonia, Lewy Body Disease, PSP, Huntington’s Disease), outstanding animal research facilities, world class neuroimaging, and a strong interdisciplinary environment. Taken together, the experiences provided by the training program provide a rich foundation – ranging from research conceptualization and design, oral and written communication, and mentorship that is fundamental to the advancement of research in the etiology and treatment of movement disorders."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia and is increasing in incidence.
While biological insight into the molecular pathogenesis of AML has greatly advanced, FDA-approved
therapeutic strategies have changed little, with the 5-year survival rate remaining around 27%. This is largely
attributed to the heterogeneous nature of AML; the variety of subtypes are defined by clinical, morphologic,
cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Consequently, there is a need to develop more effective,
molecularly-targeted therapies. Changes in the metabolome are the ultimate “response” to a genetic
modification, drug response, or disease process. Sphingolipids comprise a portion of the metabolome.
Consequently, changes in the metabolome, including sphingolipids, can be more predictive of phenotype than
other markers. The premise of our proposal is based on our published and unpublished studies that revealed
perturbations of sphingolipid metabolism in AML and the efficacy of sphingolipid-based therapeutics for AML.
The goals of this renewal are to extend these studies and further develop improved sphingolipid-based
therapeutics. Towards this end, Core A is intended to serve as a scientific and methodological connection
between the Projects to analyze changes in sphingolipid metabolism through mass spectrometry and qPCR-
based analyses of cell line, preclinical, and patient samples. Furthermore, Core A will provide ADME/PK
analyses to ascertain properties of sphingolipid-based therapeutics developed by the projects to facilitate drug
development. These studies will expedite the design of safer and more effective strategies to address the
current clinical need for improved therapeutics."

AML is a highly lethal neoplasm, which is increasing in incidence, and in spite of advances in our
understanding of AML pathogenesis, it is still largely incurable. AML is heterogeneous, with subtypes defined
by clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. This core provides viable, clinically
annotated, and moleculary characterized primary human AML samples and animal models for mechanism-
based therapeutic studies. Numerous examples of progress from grant years 1-5 have employed these
resources. This Core will pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Expand, maintain, and characterize
leukemia tissue banks. Data from the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI) Bank form much of the progress
described in this application. The Core will be strengthened by the addition of preclinical/clinical isolates from
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Our bank will be expanded through inclusion of clinical trial
specimens acquired from Project 1 (CAV trial) and ECOG. Molecularly profiled samples will be made available
to Projects and Cores for in vitro study and PDX construction (Aim 3). Aim 2) Assess the toxicities and
determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of agents in vivo. Animal models
for preclinical toxicity (dose escalation, MTD and pharmacokinetics) assessment are in place at PSCI. Results
from this Aim are critical for continued clinical development of therapeutics. Aim 3) Develop and maintain
animal models for testing program-derived therapies. This application and our published studies demonstrate
promising preclinical data acquired in a number of such models. Transplantable human AML cell line models
labelled with luciferase and YFP/RFP grown as NRG xenografts allow in vivo tumor monitoring and provide
rapid readout of anti-AML efficacy (PSCI). Considerable data are provided with these models in this
application. Pre-clinical efficacy data in such models underscore the premise of evaluating ceramide nano-
liposome (CNL), AraC and venetoclax in a phase Ib/IIa clinical trial (Project 1, pre-IND #142902, UVA Protocol
Review Committee Approval #5414, CAV trial). Dr. Levine's (co-investigator; MSKCC) novel genetically
accurate AML models provide state-of-the-art models of molecularly defined AML subtypes. These models will
be critical in defining genetically-driven alterations in sphingolipid metabolism and for testing the efficacy of
Program therapeutic regimens in all Projects (MSKCC). Finally, PDX models with well-defined primary AMLs
will be used to validate findings in NRGS hosts (PSCI and MSKCC). Efficacy of Program therapeutics will be
compared to and combined with clinically relevant standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy regimens. In
aggregate, the Animal Modeling and Clinical Resources Core is a unique and state-of-the-art resource which
provides all Projects with animal models and the clinical material needed to translate novel biologic insights
and therapeutics into clinical studies."

Speech in noise tests have traditionally involved 1) unrealistic maskers such as broadband noise presented
from the same spatial location as the target speech, and 2) unengaging reward structures. Our overarching
hypothesis is that the experience of listeners in their daily lives will be more strongly related to performance if
the laboratory tests are enhanced by increasing the realism of the testing environments and introducing game-
like interfaces. The main goal of this project is to determine which enhancements have the greatest impact on
the relationship with listener complaints, and which listener abilities (auditory and cognitive) mediate and
modulate this relationship. Enhanced environments will be tested that 1) simulate real-world experiences by
conducting assessments in synthetic environments that include both auditory and visual stimuli and 2)
introduce game-like elements that are more rewarding and motivating for the listener. Understanding how
different participants respond to a variety of enhancements will provide essential new information about the
ways in which realistic experiences differ from traditional laboratory tests and the ways that rewards and
motivation influence variability of test results as well as relationships with self-report. Experiments will involve
younger listeners with normal hearing, older listeners with a range of hearing abilities from normal to severely
impaired, and a group of listeners with a history of mild traumatic brain injury. These participants will provide a
wide range of performance on measures of auditory and cognitive abilities, which can then be used to better
understand any effects of the enhancements on self-reported ability to function in complex listening
environments. Upon completion of this project there will exist, freely available, an extensive set of enhanced
auditory assessments that are more engaging and more realistic than what is currently available and that run
on inexpensive consumer-grade equipment. This project will establish for these enhanced tests both 1)
established ranges of normal performance as a function of age and hearing loss, and 2) known relationships to
various established tests of speech in noise. The modeling work associated with this project will reveal which
auditory and cognitive abilities are associated with deviations from normal performance and self-reported
difficulties hearing in adverse listening environments that are great than would be expected."
10875593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) is the causative agent of Chagas disease (CD). With >7 million recorded cases, ~81
million at risk of Tc exposure in Latin America, and large-scale migration from endemic to other countries
including the USA where autochthonous transmission of Tc also occurs, CD remains a global health concern.
Currently no therapies exist to prophylactically treat adults traveling to endemic countries or those who may
already be infected with Tc. The economic burden for chagas cardiomyopathy and heart failure, estimated at
~$10 billion due to healthcare costs and lost productivity by premature deaths, provides a strong rationale for
investment in the development of immune therapies against CD. We have already developed a two-component
DNA vaccine (TcG2/TcG4) for CD and demonstrated preclinical efficacy of this prototype vaccine in controlling
Tc pathogenesis in a mouse model. Vaccine efficacy depends heavily on the induction of a robust TH1 response
for the clearance of intracellular pathogens like Tc. Integrin cell adhesion molecules α4β1 and αLβ2 and their
ligands, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, respectively, play an essential role in the activation of adaptive immunity.
Prolonged integrin-mediated interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), particularly via
the αLβ2/ICAM-1 axis, are required for effective T cell priming and long-term T cell mediated memory.
Augmenting cell adhesion may facilitate T cell priming and subsequent immune responses. 7HP349 is a clinical-
stage, first-in-concept, oral, small-molecule, positive allosteric activator of α4β1 and αLβ2 integrins, which could
facilitate endogenous integrin ligand-receptor engagement, promote cell adhesion, and improve T helper function
and the effectiveness of CD vaccination. We have demonstrated that 7HP349 augments the effectiveness of the
prototype TcG2/TcG4 DNA vaccine in a mouse model of CD. Additionally, 7HP349 has a favorable preclinical
safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and was found to be safe and well tolerated in a Phase 1 clinical study in
healthy male subjects. In this SBIR grant application, we propose to develop a vaccination regimen for CD
consisting of a bicistronic DNA vaccine (BCV)-adjuvant combination with 7HP349 or another integrin activator,
7HP577, demonstrate preclinical efficacy and safety of the BCV-adjuvant combination, and manufacture clinical
grade cGMP BCV and adjuvant to support a Phase I/IIa clinical study to assess the safety and tolerability of the
vaccine-adjuvant combination, and thereafter to evaluate its immunogenicity in humans. The proposed studies
will allow the development of a novel vaccination regimen to prophylactically treat Tc infection and CD."
10875598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The details we bring to mind about past positive and negative events can have important implications for
our mental wellbeing, affecting how we see ourselves and maintain relationships with others. Do we vividly
remember an argument with a friend, or the heartfelt apology that followed? Do we remember the feeling of
accomplishment after giving a talk, or our struggle to answer an audience member’s question? The details we
bring to mind also can affect our decision-making, with consequences for our social networks and career
success: Will we call that friend again? Will we agree to give a talk at an upcoming meeting?
 There are fascinating examples that suggest that what emotional details we remember from past events
may vary, in part, with a person’s age. Older age is associated with a greater use of positive (vs. negative)
words in descriptions of past events (Pennebaker & Stone, 2003; Ford et al., 2016), and with a greater
reported focus on positive aspects of otherwise challenging situations (Ford et al., 2018a, b). Yet we
understand little about why such differences arise, and the answer is likely to have implications for
understanding how cognition-emotion links differ across the adult lifespan and how adults of various ages
achieve mental wellbeing. The first aims of this research are to understand these differences upon initial
retrieval, focusing on memory phenomenology (Aim 1) and neural representations (Aim 2). Using multivoxel
pattern analysis (MVPA), we examine two types of recapitulation: trial-specific (tied to each specific encoded
event) and valence-generalized (shared across stimuli of a particular valence category). We hypothesize that,
with older age, memory representations will have more valence-generalized vs. trial-specific recapitulation, and
this age-related difference will be most pronounced for memories of positive content. We anticipate this will be
reflected in positive memories feeling subjectively vivid to older adults, while lacking in specific detail.
 A key feature of episodic memory is that it is not a static representation. The details we remember now are
not necessarily the details we will remember later, though the way we represent a memory now can tip the
scales, making some details more likely to come to mind later and others more likely to be omitted. For
emotional memories, our recent research and preliminary data suggest that retrieval at one time-point may
trigger the start of what could colloquially be thought of as a “virtuous-memory-cycle”, with positive details
emphasized and negative details de-emphasized, or the opposite, a “vicious-memory-cycle.” Critically, we
hypothesize that older age increases the likelihood of a “virtuous-memory-cycle.” We propose that age-related
differences in memory representations make it particularly likely that older adults’ initial retrieval of positive
content impairs their ability to later remember related, negative content (Aim 3) and leads to broader age-
related differences in the details accessed over successive retrievals such that, over repeated retrievals, older
age is associated with memories that become more positive (Aim 4)."

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or
ticagrelor) is the standard of care after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce the risk of
atherothrombotic events. The cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 enzyme is essential for metabolism of clopidogrel
(a prodrug) to its pharmacologically active form. Approximately 30% of the U.S. population carries a CYP2C19
loss-of-function (LOF) allele that reduces the bioactivation and effectiveness of clopidogrel, but not prasugrel or
ticagrelor, after PCI. We have demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating CYP2C19 genotyping into clinical
care to guide escalation of DAPT from clopidogrel to prasugrel or ticagrelor in patients with a CYP2C19 LOF
allele, and that a CYP2C19-guided escalation strategy reduced the risk for atherothrombotic events. However,
the influence of key patient-specific factors on outcomes with genotype-guided DAPT (notably African
ancestry, comorbidities that impact clopidogrel effectiveness, and genotypes beyond CYP2C19) has not been
defined but is critical to understand in order to optimize the clinical impact of genotype-guided DAPT.
Moreover, the impact on clinical outcomes of using CYP2C19 genotype to guide de-escalation from more
potent agents to clopidogrel in patients without a LOF allele, which has become highly clinically relevant due to
more frequent initial use of prasugrel or ticagrelor after acute coronary syndrome and PCI, has not been
investigated in a diverse, real-world clinical setting. Our long-term goal is to optimize a precision medicine
DAPT strategy that improves outcomes post-PCI. Our overall aim is to elucidate the key factors that influence
outcomes with a CYP2C19 genotype-guided precision medicine approach to DAPT. Our hypothesis is that
multiple clinical and genetic factors jointly contribute to the effectiveness and safety of CYP2C19 LOF allele-
guided selection of DAPT after PCI in a real-world clinical setting. We propose to test this hypothesis by
conducting a multi-center, observational study of 6,000 patients with PCI and clinical CYP2C19 genetic testing.
This registry will include a diverse population of real-world patients, assess atherothrombotic and bleeding
outcomes over 12 months, collect DNA samples for additional genotyping, conduct platelet reactivity testing in
a subset of patients, and be used to accomplish the following specific aims: (AIM 1) define the influence of
African ancestry and other patient-specific factors on clinical outcomes with CYP2C19 genotype-guided DAPT
following PCI in a real-world setting; (AIM 2) evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CYP2C19 genotype-
guided de-escalation of DAPT following PCI in a real-world setting; (AIM 3) elucidate the effect(s) of genetic
variants beyond CYP2C19 LOF alleles on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes with clopidogrel after PCI.
This investigation will establish optimal strategies for individualized antiplatelet therapy prescribing decisions
that improve outcomes and can be feasibly applied in a diverse, real-world population."
10873657,"1 This application describes the proposal from GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network
 2 operating under the auspices of the International Society of Travel Medicine, in response to the
 3 CDC notice of funding opportunity RFA-CK-21-002. GeoSentinel has operated continuously
 4 since 1996 by virtue of a series of cooperative agreements with the CDC and other funding
 5 sources. The network currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries on 6 continents, as well as
 6 191 affiliate sites. Our primary sites are high volume tropical and travel medicine clinics, and are
 7 directed by practitioners recognized for their clinical expertise and academic experience. These
 8 clinics all have routine access to the full spectrum of modern diagnostic resources, allowing
 9 them to establish diagnoses for ill returning travellers and migrants using the highest standards
10 of accuracy.
11 GeoSentinel has been primarily a surveillance network since its inception, although we have
12 gradually increased our research capacity. We have always focused on using travelers and
13 migrants as sentinels for the detection of emerging infections and outbreaks around the world,
14 which is exceptionally valuable to supplement information from regions where local surveillance
15 may be suboptimal. In this proposal, we propose a shift towards using our unique platform
16 primarily to answer more research oriented questions in the field. We will continue our highly
17 successful surveillance system, with each of our sites continuing to enter clinical, travel, and
18 diagnostic data on all eligible ill returning travellers, continuing to build the database which
19 produced many analyses greatly improving our understanding of the epidemiology of imported
20 infection, and has provided sentinel event notifications. Our more recent “enhanced
21 surveillance” strategy involves collected more detailed data on selected travel populations over
22 a defined time period to answer high priority, focused questions. This strategy now includes
23 research objectives, studied using patient questionnaires, standardised follow-up and outcome
24 data, and the analysis of biologic specimens. Finally, our broad network allows for the
25 enrollment of high numbers of patients with infections which are too rare for detailed study by
26 smaller, less diverse networks. We propose projects including monitoring of antimalarial
27 treatment responses, prevalence studies of strongyloidiasis in selected travellers and migrants,
28 and treatment intervention studies in the non-endemic setting. We describe the extensive
29 expertise, human and material resource we will marshal in order to continue our widely
30 recognized and successful programs."

Outcomes for cancer patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) like Nigeria are poor compared to
high-income countries (HIC). Advances in immuno-oncology (IO) research and the successes of immunotherapy
seen in HIC have not been mirrored in LMIC. Colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes, for example, are poor for
Nigerian patients when compared to similarly staged patients in the US. Through our work to understand the
biology that underlies this disparity, we have found a higher rate of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in CRC of
Nigerian versus US patients. As MSI-H tumors are immunogenic and potentially sensitive to immune checkpoint
blockade, there may be a large proportion of Nigerian patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. However,
there are few studies focused on tumor immunology and IO in Nigerian CRC. These investigations are vital as
we consider the broad application of immunotherapy in LMIC, such as Nigeria. The Nigerian Immuno-Oncology
Research (NOLA) program will integrate our expertise in IO and global cancer disparities to generate preliminary
data, resources, and biobanks for larger future studies. Specifically, in this feasibility and planning phase, we
will: 1. characterize the tumor immune microenvironment of Nigerian CRC patients and compare to a reference
cohort of US patients; 2 create a whole slide image pathology dataset of Nigerian CRC patients and controls;
and 3. build a biobank for future single-cell analyses of the tumor microenvironment of Nigerian CRC. The results
and resources generated will inform future multi-modal investigations of TME biomarkers associated with tumor
immunogenicity/outcome, cost-effective patient stratification for immunotherapy, and rational design of future
immunotherapy trials to address the disparate outcomes in Nigerian patients with CRC."

Fatigue, a feeling of tiredness and exhaustion, occurs throughout life and signiﬁcantly impacts our decisions to
engage in effortful daily activities. A wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders report fatigue as
either a symptom or comorbidity and are associated with disruptions in effort-based decision-making. Despite
the prevalence of fatigue in health and disease, there is a limited understanding of how fatigue evolves over
time and ultimately impacts effort-based decision-making. The goal of this proposal is to understand the
mechanisms that subserve the evolution of physical and cognitive fatigue through repeated exertion, and how
fatigue inﬂuences decision-making in healthy humans. Furthermore, we aim to understand how these
mechanisms are disrupted in individuals with major depressive disorders (MDD), of which fatigue is a cardinal
symptom. To this end, we will use a combination of experiments in human participants, computational modeling
of behavior, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Aim 1 we will investigate how the evolution of
fatigue inﬂuences the dynamics of effort-based decision-making. We will poll participants' momentary
subjective fatigue as they perform bouts of fatiguing exertion and make effort-based decisions. We will use
computational modeling to characterize participants' fatigue and test how this fatigue inﬂuences decisions to
exert. We will use model-based fMRI to examine how the brain integrates information about fatigue to drive
choice. In Aim 2, we will investigate how motivational state modulates feelings of fatigue and effort-based
decision-making. In this Aim we will pair fatiguing exertions with different levels of monetary incentive to
modulate participants' motivational state. This manipulation will allow us to study how motivation inﬂuences
feelings of fatigue and decisions to exert and the underlying neural mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will identify how
fatigue inﬂuences effort-based decision-making in individuals with MDD. Participants with MDD will undergo
fatiguing exertions, rate their feelings of fatigue, and make effort-based choices. We will examine how feelings
of fatigue and effort-based choice are related to MDD symptomology. In sum, our proposed studies will have a
broad impact on the ﬁeld of decision-making by dissecting the behavioral and neural mechanisms responsible
for the inﬂuence of feelings of fatigue on physical and cognitive effort valuation. In the long term, these studies
may reveal novel behavioral and neural markers to aid in the study, classiﬁcation, and treatment of fatigue."

Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is highly prevalent in the US population and has been
associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases particularly via changes in dopaminergic
(DA) neurons. Conventional PFAS chemicals are being rapidly replaced by novel chemicals with unknown long-
term neurotoxicity necessitating the comparison of neurotoxicity of various PFAS. The goal of the proposed
research is to evaluate and compare the impact of a developmental exposure to selected PFAS chemicals
including the legacy PFAS, PFOA, and its PFAS replacements, PFBA and GenX, at low doses on the plasticity
of neuronal compartments; and subsequently characterize their vulnerability to established neurotoxins
promoting DA neuron degeneration. There are limited studies comparing developmental neurotoxicity of PFAS
and the lasting impacts on the central nervous system, especially replacement PFAS due to the scarcity of
longitudinal epidemiological studies. Our studies using the zebrafish model suggest although lethality decreases
in PFAS with shorter carbon chain length and addition of side chains common in replacement PFAS,
perturbations on development, behavior, and dopamine (DA) concentrations occur at lower dose exposures in
PFAS replacements (e.g., PFBA and GenX). These findings were further corroborated using dopaminergic-like
cells differentiated from SH-SY5Y and floor plate progenitor cells derived for human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs). Collectively, PFOA seems to have a distinctive neurotoxic mechanism compared to PFBA and
GenX, while all three PFAS can result in persistent alterations at various sub-cellular compartments and perturb
calcium (Ca) homeostasis. We will thus test our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that low dose PFAS exposure disrupts
communication between different cellular compartments via altered intracellular Ca concentrations, leading to
systematic disruptions in multiple cellular compartments, interrupting the formation of the neuronal network, and
increasing risk of neuron damage and degeneration. We will use a combination of the zebrafish animal model
and DA neurons derived from hiPSC to evaluate immediate impact of developmental PFAS exposure (SA1) and
latent long-term neurotoxicity (SA2) emphasizing the dopaminergic pathway. Throughout SA1 and SA2, we will
determine changes in neuronal vulnerability to established neurotoxins for altered viability and accumulation of
degenerative markers, such as synuclein aggregates. Sub-cellular and network Ca activity will be recorded and
correlated to reveal driving pathogenic mechanisms for abnormal neuronal activity and neurodegeneration
induced by developmental PFAS exposure, while exploring normalization options (SA3). Collectively, we will
determine unique and shared neurotoxicity associated with selected PFAS; reveal sub-cellular compartments
most compromised and conferring to the neurodegenerative-like phenotype; and explore the feasibility of
restoring neuronal plasticity via targeted interventions."

Cachexia is a devastating complication of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) defined by loss of lean
mass out of proportion to the caloric deficit. Cachexia is a major determinant of both lifespan and quality of life
in patients with PDAC. The mechanisms underlying this catabolic state are poorly understood, and there
remain no effective treatments. We have recently found that PDAC alters the regulation of metabolic genes in
the liver, the organ that controls whole-body physiology in response to nutrient availability. The metabolic
program reflects high energy availability in the livers of cachectic mice, suggesting a mismatch between
hepatic nutrient sensing and availability. In this proposal we will investigate the role of this hepatic metabolic
reprogramming on PDAC-associated cachexia. In Aim 1 we will modulate the hepatic activity of mTOR, a
nutrient-sensing kinase that controls liver metabolism, to demonstrate that modification of hepatic nutrient
sensing impacts tissue wasting. In Aim 2 we will investigate the effect of PDAC on nutritive and circadian
regulation of liver metabolism and explore human samples for coherent effects. These Aims will provide
fundamental insight into the deregulation of hepatic metabolism by PDAC, its role in cancer cachexia, and the
circulating signals that mediate these changes.
My goal is to become a successful independent physician-scientist investigator and a leader in the field of
cancer metabolism, with the long-term goals of identifying new therapeutic targets to improve lifespan and
quality of life in cancer patients. During this mentored career development award, I will receive excellent
mentorship from Dr. Rosalie Sears, a leader in pancreatic tumor biology and Director of the Brenden-Colson
Center for Pancreatic Care. I will undertake additional training in the field of hepatic metabolism, with guidance
from Dr. Markus Grompe, and cachexia physiology, under the tutelage of Dr. Daniel Marks."
10882653,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Innate immune factors are critical for the selection and maintenance of regional commensal gut microbiota that
provide beneficial functions for the host and deterrence against pathogens and pathobionts. In the previous grant
cycle, we discovered that peptide YY (PYY), an anorexigenic or satiety-related gut hormone of intestinal
enteroendocrine L-cell origin, is expressed by innate immune intestinal Paneth cells (PC) and functions as an
antimicrobial peptide (AMP) in its unmodified PYY1-36 form (henceforth referred to as PC-PYY1-36). PYY's
structure differs from other PC-α and β−defensins but is remarkably similar to the amphibian AMP, magainin-2,
that has both anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties. PC-PYY1-36 further differs from other PC-AMPs by
selectively targeting and killing the virulent (hyphal), but not commensal (yeast) forms of polymorphic gut fungi
like Candida albicans, thereby playing an important role in maintaining fungal (and also bacterial) commensalism
of the gut. PC-PYY1-36 also differs from the endocrine PYY3-36 that is derived from DPP-IV conversion of L-cell
PYY in structure and function by being vectorally secreted into and retained by intestinal mucus where its activity
is optimal and protected from dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) modification that would otherwise convert it to the
endocrine PYY3-36 form. We subsequently discovered that PCs also express another anorexigenic peptide highly
related to PYY, neuropeptide Y (NPY1-36), that also has AMP properties. However, its regulation, antimicrobial
spectrum, and compartmentalization upon secretion in luminal fluid rather than overlying mucus differs from that
of PC-PYY. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that PC-PYY and PC-NPY are a novel class of PC-
AMPs that play important roles in maintaining gut microbial commensalism and conferring innate
immune defense against certain pathogens and pathobionts. Two specific aims are proposed: (1) to define
and differentiate the drivers, mediators, and signaling pathways involved in regulation of PC-PYY and PC-NPY
gene expression, secretion, and regional compartmentalization under physiological and pathophysiological
conditions, and (2) to determine and differentiate the antimicrobial spectra of PC-PYY and -NPY in vitro and in
vivo and their impact on gene expression and adaptive responses of targeted bacterial and fungal species. These
studies will employ newly established in vivo (PC-PYY and PC-NPY KO and PC-PYY transgenic mice) as well
as in vitro and ex vivo approaches. The MPI team combines unique expertise and resources in experimental
research, multi'omic technologies, and host-microbe interactions (Chang, UChicago), experimental physiology
and pathophysiology (Pierre, UWisc-M), and microbiology, bioinformatics, and genetics (Peters, UTHSC). Thus,
the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. The MPI groups have collaborated productively over the
past two years to acquire the preliminary and feasibility data, establish proof of concept, and set in motion new
lines of inquiry. The initial findings from these studies are in press with the journal Science."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with poor prognosis. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction/failure
consequent to high RV afterload is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in PH, yet no RV targeted
therapies are available. This contrasts with several drug classes that are beneficial in LV dysfunction. Therefore,
there remains an unmet need to therapeutically target the mechanisms underlying RV dysfunction to improve
long-term outcomes in PH. Cardiomyocytes determine RV function in PH. Mitochondria through oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are the major source of energy in the heart. Targeting RV mitochondrial
bioenergetics and function in settings of PH may provide novel therapeutic strategies to improve RV function in
PH. Respiratory complexes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain play a critical role in oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and generation of reactive oxygen species. OXPHOS machinery subunits have
been found to be highly phosphorylated, implicating phosphorylation as a means whereby OXPHOS is regulated.
To date, tyrosine phosphorylation (P-Tyr) is recognized as a critical regulatory mechanism in mitochondria and
c-Src is the major tyrosine kinase localized in mitochondria. The overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the
mechanisms underlying impaired RV mitochondrial energetics and function in PH. Our preliminary findings
strongly support a novel mechanism governing RV complex I assembly and function in PH that is mediated by
P-Tyr of complex proteins. Completion of this study is expected to identify a new targeted strategy to
preserve/restore electron transfer chain function in RV cardiomyocytes in vivo in settings of PH."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for more than 40% of leukemia mortality in the United States. Each
year around ten thousand people die from the disease, most within a few years of diagnosis. Despite advances
in our understanding of the disease, few improvements in the therapy of AML have been made. Specific
targets and novel strategies to eliminate AML stem cells are required for AML treatment. In preliminary studies,
the PI’s lab has observed the following: 1) The expression of DPP4 negatively correlates with AML patient
overall survival in 3 different databases. 2) DPP4 inhibitors can prevent AML development in vivo. 3) DPP4
inhibitors can prevent both human and mouse AML cells growth in vitro. 4) DPP4 knock out (KO) AML cells
transplanted mice exhibit delay and reversal of AML development in two retroviral-induced AML mouse
models. 5) DPP4 KO AML stem cells and progenitors (AML-SCP) are restrained in the bone marrow, with
increased apoptosis, and reduced self-renewal ability. 6) DPP4 knockdown prevents the growth of human AML
cells. 7) The activation of Src, IkB, and p65 is reduced in DPP4 KO AML cells. Based on these preliminary
data, the central hypothesis is: DPP4 regulated trafficking, activation and apoptosis of AML-SCPs are
critical for human AML development, which will be addressed in three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine
the role of DPP4 in human AML development. The localization, apoptosis, and self-renewal of DPP4
deficient human AML-SCP will be investigated by colony forming unit assay and human AML cells xenografted
mouse model. Using the xenograft model, the effect of DPP4 inhibitors treatment alone or in combination with
standard chemotherapy to prevent AML development will be evaluated. Aim 2: Examine regulation of AML-
SCP engraftment to the BM by DPP4. This will include identification of the critical cytokines regulated by
DPP4 for AML-SCP trafficking. To test this, the PI will use migration and engraftment assays. In addition, the
PI will investigate localization and niche cells interaction of DPP4 KO AML-SCPs in the BM microenvironment
by imaging studies. Aim3: Investigate the role of DPP4 in AML-SCP survival. We will explore the critical
domain of DPP4, if DPP4-Src interaction is essential for AML-SCP survival, how DPP4 regulates the activity
and protein level of Src in AML-SCP and determine if dual therapy with DPP4 and Src inhibitors has greater
benefits against human AML-SCP survival. Collectively, the proposed research will broadly impact the field by
identification of a novel treatment for AML, via the strategy of confinement of AML-SCP to bone marrow, and
improving the understanding of the role of microenvironment in the development of AML-SCPs."
10882251,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite recent exponential growth of the field of cardiovascular genetics leading to identification of hundreds of
mutations responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the mechanism linking sarcomeric mutations to
the disease progression to heart failure (HF) remains unclear. Clinical features of HCM are severe left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Given success in
sudden death prevention, the predominant cause of HCM-related morbidity and mortality is HF. Importantly,
recent reports show profound structural mitochondrial damage in patients with HCM. The goal of this proposal
is to improve mitochondrial function to delay or reverse the progression of HCM. This proposal considers
worsened myocardial energetics as the initial shared stimulus that, when triggered by a sarcomeric mutation,
leads to the development of the clinical phenotype. HCM mutations inefficiently increase power output of the
sarcomere, resulting in several-fold increased ATP demand. Mitochondria meet the excessive ATP demand,
albeit at a cost of accumulation of ADP, a product of ATP hydrolysis. Elevated ADP, in turn, limits the amount
of chemical energy extractable from ATP to pump sodium and calcium ions. This leads to slower removal of
calcium during relaxation of the heart resulting in diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, elevated intracellular sodium
further impairs mitochondrial ATP synthesis and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
Excessive ROS, in turn, oxidatively inhibit mitochondrial proteins and ATP synthesis. Continuous excessive
demand causes mitochondria to switch their fuel preference towards glucose oxidation. Such shift is initially
beneficial, but over time supports LVH and depletes mitochondria of important metabolites. Thus, even though
the primary defect is in the inefficient sarcomere, severe mitochondrial damage ensues. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that interventions that improve energy balance have the capacity to reverse mitochondrial
damage in HCM. We will restore energy balance by decreasing ATP demand and increasing ATP supply.
Phosphorus and carbon magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging will determine whether improvements
in fuel preference and ROS production reverse mitochondrial damage and hypertrophy in murine models of
HCM. In mice bearing two of the most lethal HCM mutations, R403Q in myosin and R92L in troponin T, we will
pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1) To determine the extent to which treatment with CK-274, inhibitor
of the engine of the sarcomere - myosin, improves mitochondrial function and structure in HCM mice. 2) To
test the hypothesis that suppressing excessive mitochondrial ROS by overexpressing mitochondrial catalase
increases ATP synthesis and prevents mitochondrial damage and hypertrophy in HCM. 3) To determine
whether empagliflozin, clinically used antidiabetic medication, reverses the maladaptive cardiac substrate
preference, mitochondrial damage and LVH in HCM. These results will provide immediately translatable tools
to modify the disease process in HCM and other mitochondria-based cardiovascular conditions."

In the United States alone, respiratory viral pathogenic infections such as influenza cause millions of
provider visits and tens of thousands of work days lost, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and
deaths. According to the World Health Organization, the number of viral pathogenic infections continues
to rise with higher mortalities in resource limited countries. While a successful vaccine strategy is highly
desirable, this approach relies on the induction of B cells to produce protective antibodies that either
prevent viruses from entering cells or target infected cells for destruction. Unfortunately, successful
vaccines for many viruses are not yet available after decades of research such a respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). In this proposal, we leverage a novel approach developed by Dr. Justin Taylor’s laboratory
to genetically engineer B cells to express antibodies protective against respiratory viruses including
RSV and influenza. This strategy has already been shown to result in the production of protective
antibodies against influenza, RSV, and human immunodeficiency virus infection [Moffett et al., Science
Immunology, 2019]. While this approach can ensure protective antibody production, the genetic
engineering process required 10 days of complicated ex vivo manufacturing and is not broadly
distributable. To overcome these barriers, we will co-opt a novel, synthetic nanoparticle that was
developed in Dr. Jennifer Adair’s laboratory to deliver genetic engineering in a single, passive step
[Shahbazi et al., Nature Materials, 2019]. We show that this nanoparticle can be assembled to
genetically engineer primary human blood cells in less than 2 days, and can be modified to specifically
interact with target blood cell types in vivo. Here we will develop this scalable nanoformulation as a
vaccine-like in vivo delivery system to direct immune responses against respiratory viruses such as
RSV. We will use these nanoparticles to directly genetically engineer the most protective primary B cell
subtypes, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which can provide lifelong replenishment of
protective B cells and antibodies. This research will not only develop a unique tool set against viral
pathogens, but will provide transformative advances in equitable distribution of gene editing therapies."

The University of Pennsylvania Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Systems Clinical Center
(PENN+PLUS CC) is a diverse, experienced, committed and invaluable member of the
Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Network, presenting an exceptional team
of interdisciplinary investigators bringing expertise in adolescent and women’s pelvic health
care, health behavior and prevention science, instrument development, and epidemiology. We
are distinguished by our focus on implementation science and our unique location at the
intersection of urban and rural areas and benefit from the significant and unique wealth of
resources of UPenn. In Phase 1, the PENN+PLUS investigators made significant contributions
to all PLUS publications and presentations during Phase 1. This includes 11 articles published
or in press, 6 submitted manuscripts, and 26 refereed national and international presentations
For Phase 2, to bolster the strength of our engagement with the community, we have partnered
with the Penn Community Engagement Core, which will develop a realistic plan for inclusion of
community partners, and have added new team members as Co-investigators, Drs Heather
Klusaritz and Terri Lipman, who have expertise in community-based participatory research
methods. We propose specific aims for Phase 2 efforts that address all of the needs stipulated
in the RFA, including support for a nationally representative population-based large cohort study
of bladder health (Aim 1), a project to develop and validate a novel tool for evaluating bladder
self-care among adolescent girls and women (Aim 2), and pilot testing of a community-based
bladder health promotion program (Aim 3)."
10884877,"The Prevention of Lower Urinary tract Symptoms (PLUS) Consortium is investing in understanding bladder health and
lower-urinary track symptom prevention. The Consortium’s proposed healthy bladder definition is: “A complete state of
physical, mental, and social well-being related to bladder function and not merely the absence of lower urinary tract
symptoms (LUTS). Healthy bladder function permits daily activities, adapts to short-term physical or environmental
stressors, and allows optimal well-being.” We are only beginning to understand the risk and protective factors that can
potentiate or destroy well-being across the spectrum—from having a healthy bladder to experiencing chronic LUTS. One
overarching, powerful component is the act of drinking and the state of the bladder, or what we call the Beverages to
Bladder (B2B) balance. Across the life course, B2B is a fact—what goes in must come out, usually through the bladder.
Despite the obvious, little data exists to guide adolescent and adult women in the what, when, and why of choosing
beverage type, volume, and timing of intake as it pertains to promoting their bladder health. Our broad goal is to know
what beverage intake pattern(s) relate best to a truly healthy bladder. To reach this goal, we aim to: 1) Determine the
distribution of bladder health across the spectrum from healthy bladder to chronic LUTS in U.S. adolescent and adult
women, monitoring changes in bladder health over time across the life course; 2) Establish and validate the optimal B2B
balance across the life course by identifying beverage intake patterns and determining which are associated with the
range of the bladder health spectrum; and 3) Explore adolescent and adult women’s lived experiences of B2B balance,
including the biological, interpersonal, sociocultural, and environmental influences—any of which might be early
facilitators or barriers to optimizing B2B balance over the life course. We will work closely within the PLUS consortium to
launch a large population based observational survey study to measure bladder health, including knowledge, attitudes,
and beliefs; as well as risk and protective factors. We will also have available a new data collection tool for use in this
longitudinal study called Where I Go, a phone application developed at The University of Michigan. It captures beverage
intake in real time, toileting experiences, and other influences affecting how adolescent and adult women manage B2B
in their day-to-day lives. This data will be analyzed along with survey information and data in other pre-existing datasets.
Each component offers uniqueness that can help us identify women’s variations in beverage intake patterns, and how
patterns relate to bladder health across the life course. We hypothesize there is a best pattern for optimizing bladder
health, but there may be many reasons why a woman’s beverage intake differs from a best pattern. We will use
adolescents and adult women focus groups combined with Where I Go to learn what influences beverage intake.
Ultimately, we hope to gain new insights to inform interventions to help each woman understand her B2B balance and
optimize it for bladder health."

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease affecting the most fragile premature infants,
with mortality rates that persist at 20-40%. Accurate and conclusive early diagnosis of NEC remains elusive,
with limited diagnostic confidence complicating timely and effective medical management efforts to prevent
disease progression to urgent surgical removal of necrotic intestine. As the population of premature infants
at the highest risk for NEC continues to rise, a critical need has emerged to develop innovative clinically
translatable diagnostic methods to enable early interventional opportunities to combat this disease. Motivated
by the significance of the translational potential, clinical need, and extensive promising preliminary data, we
propose to investigate the development and use of photoacoustic imaging (PAI), an emerging non-invasive
imaging modality, in healthy neonatal intestine and NEC disease, representing a novel first-in-disease
preclinical investigation. PAI methods present enormous potential for fundamentally changing current clinical
paradigms by non-invasively detecting, diagnosing, and monitoring intestinal pathologies, such as NEC, in
premature infants. We hypothesize that PAI can accurately and quantitatively characterize changes in the NEC
vascular hallmark of intestinal tissue hypoxia and NEC intestinal functional hallmark of motility to improve the
diagnosis and monitoring of intestinal disease in premature infants. The aims of this application reflect a
stepwise development and validation study to optimize PAI acquisition and analysis methods to assess early
healthy development and NEC disease onset and progression in the neonatal intestine. In Aim 1, we will
optimize PAI measurements of neonatal intestinal tissue oxygenation. In Aim 2, we will optimize PAI
measurements of functional neonatal intestinal motility. Under each aim, we will compare quantitative
characterization of physiological biophysical indicators for neonatal intestinal microvasculature and function
from PAI with paired histopathological analysis. This enables our study to uncover the cellular and molecular
origins of observed changes on PAI. Combined, the proposed studies will establish PAI as a non-invasive
detection and quantitative imaging methodology to detect differences in neonatal intestinal tissue oxygenation
and functional motility in the healthy developing infant intestine and in NEC disease onset and progression.
The development of new advanced non-invasive imaging methods for neonatal intestinal disease presents
significant translational opportunity to improve the quality of care in the NICU. With considerable rationale and
strong preliminary data establishing feasibility for the use of PAI to detect changes in intestinal
microvasculature and function, this project has a high likelihood of demonstrating success in quantitative
characterization of NEC in these proposed first-in-disease studies. Our multi-disciplinary study team is well-
positioned to develop these innovative imaging methods specifically designed for feasible clinical translation as
a first-in-disease investigation to make a significant impact in intestinal health in premature infants."
10881517,"Our studies pursue exciting new data supporting the hypothesis that the circulating monocyte (MON) and its
derivatives, the MON-derived dendritic cell (MO-DC) and the MON-derived macrophage (MO-MØ) orchestrate
a chronic innate immune response that underlies the progressive occlusive vascular pathology in pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH). In Aim 1, we relate a reduction in BMPR2, the most frequently mutated gene in
PAH, to an increase in the retroviral element HERV-K in MON. We extend new findings in MON suggesting that
reduced BMPR2, through a DNA repair response, increases phosphorylated KAP1, resulting in transcriptional
activation of XIST, the lncRNA that inactivates the X chromosome. We elucidate whether the increase in XIST
competitively recruits the deacetylase SPEN away from HERV-K, resulting in an increase in HERV-K expression
and consequent viral innate immune interferon (IFN)-STAT1 signaling. We determine whether this is a feature
of MON in all forms of PAH, particularly in females, and persists in PAH MO-DC and MO-MØ. We investigate
whether the propensity to apoptosis in PAH MON is related to IFN-STAT1 signaling and results in differentiation
of surviving MON that invade pulmonary arteries to become pro-inflammatory MO-DC and MO-MØ. In Aim 2,
we add MON differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (iMON) to novel bio-fabricated vascular
tubes perfused under physiologic or high shear stress and populated with iPSC-differentiated endothelial cells
(iEC) lining the lumen surrounded by circumferentially arranged iPSC-differentiated smooth muscle cells (iSMC)
derived from PAH patients carrying a BMPR2 mutation or from control subjects. Single cell RNA Seq is applied
to find mechanisms explaining (i) differentiation of iMON to iMO-DC and iMO-MØ, (ii) iMO-DC induced iSMC
proliferation, and (iii) iMO-MØ impaired phagocytosis. Monocytes from athymic rats treated with SUGEN 5416
where females develop more severe PAH than males, and Bmpr2+/- rats treated with 5-lipoxygenase that develop
PAH with no gender bias will be assessed for the innate immune response observed in human PAH MON. Two
strategies will be used to trace MON differentiation to MO-DC and MO-MØ during the evolution of PAH in the
rats and we will determine whether blocking IFN prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH. In Aim 3
CRISPR inhibitory technology is applied in which iPSC expressing dCAS9KRAB are differentiated to iMON and
transduced with guides targeting a reduction in 9 genes expressed in MON and mutant in PAH. We will determine
whether these cells share a common pathway of gene dysregulation. Bio-fabricated vascular tubes populated
with iEC and iSMC with a reduction in these PAH genes are used to determine the contribution of mutant vascular
cells to iMON differentiation to iMO-DC and iMO-MØ. Genome wide CRISPR screens are applied to find
regulators of HERV-K expression and agents that improve PAH MØ phagocytosis. By uncovering the
mechanism causing an innate immune response in MON, MO-DC and MO-MØ, we aim to find new ways to treat
PAH and conditions associated with a protracted innate immune response, e.g., related to IFN-STAT1 signaling."

This R25 Short-Term Research Education Program to Enhance Diversity in Health-Related Research titled
“Washington University (WU) SummeR reseArch DIversity ProgrAm iN Cardiovascular Disease & HEmatology
(RADIANCE)” proposal is in response to RFA-HL-22-012. We build upon our extensive experience with two
currently-existing programs: 1) NHLBI-funded “Programs to Increase Diversity among Individuals Engaged in
Health-Related Research (PRIDE)”, which focuses on nationally underrepresented in medicine (URM) junior
faculty; and 2) WU Institute for Public Health Summer Research Program (IPH-SRP) – Public and Global Health
Track that has trained undergraduate and health professional students in health research for past eight years.
Our excellent track-record with these summer research programs and established infrastructure allows for
seamless program expansion and integration. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Hematologic Disorders
are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and globally. Disparities in diagnosis and treatment of
both CVD and Hematologic Disorders are highly prevalent. We propose to recruit, provide training, mentoring
and career development and research skills to undergraduate and health professional students (total: 12 URM
trainees/year) who are individuals: A) from racial/ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in health-related
sciences on a national basis; B) with disabilities; and C) from disadvantaged backgrounds, through the following
OBJECTIVES: Objective 1. To recruit, train, mentor, and engage a diverse URM students group with interests
in exploring research careers, thorough a multidisciplinary approach necessary to advance research on CVD
and Hematologic Disorders. Objective 2. To provide rigorous didactics, structured mentoring and hands-
on research experiences that foster knowledge, attitudes, and skills in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical
research. Objective 3. To expose and nurture trainee interests in research, academic and professional
development in CVD/Hematologic Disorders and to provide research experiences that will help inform future
career and training opportunities. Objective 4. To prepare, under guidance from mentors and program
leadership, a “capstone experience” summary presentation at the end of the program that synthesizes the
trainee learning and research experience. The overarching goal of RADIANCE is to provide creative and highly
relevant educational activities with primary focus on research experiences and mentoring activities for enhancing
diversity of the biomedical research workforce. The goals of this proposal align with scientific priorities of NHLBI
to: 1) provide broad CVD/Hematologic Disorders teaching and research training; 2) provide scientific
research foundation for trainees; 3) ensure equitable & inclusive program access and participation of diverse
US populations. NHLBI-funded WU Program & Mentoring Faculty will offer excellent experiences for mentees.
We are optimistic that this proposal will help enhance the diversity of the research workforce in areas of
importance to the NHLBI mission."

 The pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of blinding corneal
infections in the USA and worldwide. This includes a recent outbreak of drug resistant P.
aeruginosa keratitis in contaminated eyedrops that caused keratitis in 68 patients from 16 US
states and resulted in 3 deaths and 8 enucleations. Our earlier studies supported by this grant
demonstrated that P. aeruginosa virulence in infected corneas is due to expression of the Type
III secretion system, which comprises a needle structure that injects exoenzymes directly into
the host cell cytosol. Our recent data show that using either NLRP3-/- mice or the NLRP3 small
molecule inhibitor MCC950, P. aeruginosa ExoS ADP ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) selectively
licenses NLRP3 inflammasome usage in neutrophils (where macrophages use the NLRC4
inflammasome) for IL-1β processing and secretion, and importantly that NLRP3 is required for
effective bacterial killing in infected corneas that can be blocked with the small molecule
inhibitor MCC950. Proposed studies in Aim 1 will examine the early events in NLRP3 activation
in neutrophils, including a role for NEK7 and HDAC6, which will also be examined during
infection. Aim 2 will use an HEK293 based expression system to produce mg levels of NLRP3
that can used to identifying NLRP3 domains and specific arginine residues that are targeted by
ExoS ADPRT. Aim 3 will examine cell death pathways in corneal epithelial cells and neutrophils
infected with P. aeruginosa expressing the Type II secretion protein ToxA and determine if there
is a role for NLRP1 pyroptotic cell death and in corneal infections. Results of these proposed
studies will identify novel targets for immune intervention in this blinding infection."
10879106,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Air pollution is a leading risk factor for the national disease burden in India, resulting in an estimated 1.17
million adult and 116,000 neonatal deaths in 2019. Ambient air pollution is increasing steadily across Indian
megacities and nearly 100% of the population experience exposures to unsafe levels of fine particulate matter
(PM2.5). Further, exposures to air toxics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are likely to be
widespread in urban India on account of ubiquity of sources and high volume of emissions, but exposures to
air toxics remain poorly characterized. Impacts of air pollution on pregnant women and the developing fetus
have tremendous implications for India where, the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW <2.5 kg birthweight) is
already high (15 to 30% across states). Despite the ubiquity of health damaging PM2.5 and PAHs exposure and
high prevalence of LBW, evidence linking these exposures to adverse pregnancy outcomes has been limited in
India. To address this evidence gap, the study proposes to establish an urban cohort of 300 pregnant women
in Chennai (a megacity in southern India) to examine pregnancy period exposures to PM2.5 and PAHs through
personal monitoring and biomarker measurements and examine associations with birthweight. The proposed
research builds on the extensive capacities at the host institution created through previous NIH supported
projects. The study will recruit 300 pregnant women from outpatient clinics of Sri Ramachandra Hospital
(applicants host institute), conduct 24-hour personal exposure measurements for PM2.5 and PAHs three times,
once during each trimester using a wearable sampler and assess the oxidative potential of the PM2.5 fractions
(PM-OP) by acellular assays and its relationship with PM2.5 and PAHs. Urinary levels of PAH metabolites (2-
naphthol and 1-hydroxypyrene) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative
damage will be measured during each trimester and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) will be measured in cord
blood. This will allow an evaluation of the individual and interactive associations between PM2.5, PAHs, PM-OP,
urinary biomarkers (PAH metabolites and 8-OHdG) and telomere length. On a 100-person subset of the
cohort, Fresh Air wristbands will be used to provide a measure of personal exposure to PAHs and will be
evaluated with other measures of exposure and effect. Finally, the differential effects of PM2.5 and PAHs on
term low-birth weight will be examined using single, two and multipollutant models. The study will strengthen
the limited available exposure-response evidence for prenatal PM2.5 and PAH exposures and birthweight in
India while also identifying potential vulnerable exposure windows. Career development activities will focus on
advanced training in novel exposure assessment techniques, mass spectrometry-based techniques for
biomarker analysis, regression analysis and multipollutant modeling. The increased investigator capacities will
allow research beyond traditional PM mass-related health effects to address multiple environmental exposures
that predominate in high exposure settings of urban India."
10877503,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play key roles in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PGC-1α is a master
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses. PGC-1α deficiency plays a key role in
dopaminergic (DA) neuronal survival, including vulnerability to α-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity, and also potentially in
Alzheimer’s disease. However, viral vector mediated overexpression of PGC-1α at high levels causes DA
neurons to degenerate and increases susceptibility to MPTP toxicity. Thus, harnessing the therapeutic potential
of PGC-1α likely requires normalization (or only mild elevation) of its expression levels in neurons. Achieving this
requires a better understanding of mechanisms regulating PGC-1α. We hypothesize that chaperone-mediated
autophagy (CMA) regulates PGC-1α indirectly by regulating FBW7, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that
promotes the degradation of critical regulatory proteins, including PGC-1α. We have found that SCFFBW7 harbors
the perfect CMA consensus sequence, “KFERQ”, and that increasing CMA decreases FBW7 and increases
PGC-1α protein levels. We hypothesize that CMA degrades FBW7, thus reducing UPS-mediated degradation of
PGC-1α:
↑CMA  ↓ FBW7  ↑ PGC-1α
. FBW7 is a target of PRKN, with Prkn loss leading to increased FBW7
in Prkn-null mice, which in turn reduces levels of the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl-1. Furthermore, brain FBW7 levels
are increased in PD patients with PRKN mutations. Thus, FBW7 is a potential therapeutic target in PD, but our
understanding of mechanisms regulating FBW7 is limited. To this end, we have preliminary data implicating that
p300/SIRT1 dependent regulation of FBW7 acetylation plays a potentially key role in regulating FBW7 levels.
p300/SIRT1 also interact directly with PGC-1α, and thus may represent a homeostatic mechanism for
maintaining stable levels of PGC-1α activity. We now propose first to analyze molecular mechanisms that
regulate FBW7 and PGC-1α, and then will specifically test our hypothesis that reducing SCFFBW7 in DA neurons
will protect against αSyn toxicity in a mouse model of PD."

This is an application for the NIH K23 Career Development Award. The goal of the proposed project is to
provide the candidate with advanced skills needed to become an independent clinician-scientist using data
science techniques to examine the role of social determinants of health in diabetic retinopathy. To facilitate this
long-term goal, the candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan including: 1) formal coursework and
obtaining a Master of Science in Applied Health Sciences Informatics, 2) practical hands-on training overseen
by her multidisciplinary mentoring team who span the fields of medicine, public health, and data science, and
3) involvement in seminars and workshops. Specific goals are to: 1) understand concepts in social
determinants of health and principles of public health interventions, 2) develop skills in data science research
including informatics and biostatistics, and 3) submit an NIH R01 and other non-NIH grants that build on the
findings of this project.
The research project will facilitate attainment of the career development goals. Lapses in care is a major
preventable cause of vision loss among patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and disproportionately affects
individuals of the lowest socioeconomic status. Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a critical role in
health outcomes and underlie these health disparities. Current attempts to systematically address SDoH in DR
have been limited by two missing components: accurate prediction of the at-risk population, and identification
of the most impactful SDoH. The focus of this research proposal is to address this gap. In Aim 1) we will use
an innovative approach of incorporating neighborhood-level SDoH measures, as obtained from the U.S.
Census Bureau measured on the block group level, to predict lapses in care. The hypothesis is that patients
from neighborhoods characterized by lower socioeconomic status, more housing and food insecurity, and
difficulty with healthcare access and affordability are more likely to experience lapses in DR care. In Aim 2) we
will construct a novel comprehensive SDoH framework that links socioeconomic status to lapses in DR care
through various intermediary SDoH including housing stability, food security, and healthcare (access,
affordability, and quality). We will use mediation analysis to identify the intermediary SDoH that most strongly
mediates the impact of socioeconomic status on lapses in DR care. The hypothesis is that access to
healthcare is a critical mediator. Results from this research will be used to develop a subsequent NIH R01
research proposal focused on designing targeted interventions to eliminate lapses in care and promote health
equity in DR."

The ability of glioblastomas to proliferate in an uncontrollable manner and disperse widely within normal brain
define the malignant phenotype and make this disease uniformly lethal. Effectively treating glioblastoma
therefore requires finding targets that drive these two components of the malignant phenotype. We have
identified one such target—the myosin II family of molecular motors. We show that myosin II family members
can be targeted with a non-toxic small molecule inhibitor that is CNS permeant, and that this drug suppresses
tumor progression and significantly prolongs survival in murine models of glioblastoma. However, we also find
that targeting myosin II family members leads to a compensatory upregulation of a variety of proliferation-
stimulating signaling pathways, and that inhibiting these pathways is synthetically lethal when myosin II function
is blocked. In this proposal, we will develop strategies to enhance the efficacy of a myosin II targeting strategy
in treating glioblastoma that build on our novel findings. Results from these translational studies will be vital to
our ongoing efforts to develop effective treatment approaches that block both glioblastoma invasion and
proliferation."

Mice, monkeys, and humans can regenerate their digit tips following amputation. This innate form of composite
tissue regeneration is a highly coordinated process involving multiple tissue types interacting to form a
replacement digit tip with the proper composition and pattern. Defining what is unique to the digit tip in terms of
molecular signals or cell types, and how it relates to regeneration, can inform broader regeneration efforts of
non-regenerative tissues. One foothold into this process is the recent cellular characterization of the mouse
digit tip blastema, the collection of progenitor cells that forms following amputation that is necessary to give rise
to the regenerating tissue. Our single cell RNA sequencing-based analysis of the blastema identified 13
molecularly distinct fibroblast populations. With this, we now have specific cellular populations to individually
assess for their function(s) in digit tip regeneration. We propose that the subpopulations of fibroblasts in the
regenerating mouse digit tip encompass separable roles including progenitors, structural, and niche-factor-
producing cells, of which a subset may promote composite tissue regeneration. In this proposal, we focus on
digit tip fibroblast heterogeneity and aim to determine the origin, function, and regenerative potential of each of
these populations. We will analyze the spatial organization of the fibroblast subpopulations in mouse and
human digit tips and determine those comprised of progenitor cells. Using single cell RNA sequencing with
lineage tracing, we will determine when the digit tip heterogeneity of the adult digit is established, and define
the cellular plasticity and regenerative contribution of the fibroblast populations to the regenerated tissue.
Finally, we will investigate how the digit tip fibroblast subpopulations relate in identity and function to fibroblasts
from non-regenerative proximal amputations. Collectively, the data generated in this project will provide a
comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous population of digit tip fibroblasts in the context of
regeneration, which will lay the foundation for composite tissue regeneration on a broader scale."

Use of vaping products (e.g., electronic nicotine delivery systems, e-cigarettes) has been increasing rapidly,
particularly among teens and young adults. With limited information on the long-term effects of vaping
products, health information about vaping has been somewhat unclear in regards to associated health risks.
Teens and young adults may be reluctant to disclose their use of vaping products to parents or health providers
and instead turn to social media to share and seek out information regarding vaping risks and cessation
supports. Given the ubiquitous use of social media platforms among this population and the ability for
advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to analyze content
shared on social media platforms, there is strong potential for this information to be leveraged and used to
detect and reach out to those most at risk for negative health outcomes caused by vaping. Thus, our current
proposal outlines the use of detection models to identify teens and young adults socially networking about
vaping, the use of a chatbot to screen for the needs of eligible users, and the use of a digital intervention system
(i.e., quitSTART with an embodied chatbot) aimed to support vaping cessation efforts by increasing risk
awareness and decreasing pro-vaping attitudes. In Aim #1a, we will develop an intelligent detection system by
leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and NLP techniques for mining massive social
media data on vaping with clinical inputs. This detection system will implement multiple functionalities on
both Twitter and Reddit social media platforms to identify posts regarding the use of vaping products, negative
health outcomes experienced, and interest in vaping cessation. To evaluate the validity and specificity of the
detection model developed on both platforms, we will also conduct surveys among a subsample of those
identified (N=100) to rule out false positives and to gather data on vaping behaviors, social media content
generation about vaping, motivations for vaping product use, and interest in vaping cessation to refine the
developed models in Aim #1b. In Aim #2, we will develop both a chatbot to screen individuals identified on
social media as well as an in-app chatbot to guide users to tailored content, conduct daily assessments and
check-ins, motivate and encourage their cessation efforts, and promote sustained user engagement within a
widely-used evidence-based mobile application (app) intervention for combustible smoking, quitSTART. We
will conduct usability and acceptability testing on both levels of the chatbot among a sample of participants
(N=30) recruited in Aim #1b. In Aim #3, we aim to integrate the developed detection model, chatbot screener,
and adapted mobile app into a streamlined outreach and intervention system, and conduct a randomized
controlled trial (N= 189) to evaluate user engagement with and preliminary efficacy of the digital intervention
on vaping behaviors among teens and young adults. This integrated system has the potential to improve public
health outcomes related to vaping and to inform the feasibility of such chatbot tools to sustain mHealth
intervention engagement."
10876445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal builds on the scientific premise that right ventricular (RV) maladaptive remodeling is a major
contributor to RV failure and mortality in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite its importance, no RV-directed
therapies exist. The goal of this proposal is to is to identify 1) whether Apelin prevents RV failure and 2) whether
Apelin-mediated protection is dependent on abrogation of RAAS and activation of ACE2. We provide evidence
that treatment with Apelin can prevent ventricular-vascular uncoupling in vivo. We also provide evidence in
human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-SMs), RV-specific endothelial cells (RVECs), and
pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) that treatment with Apelin increases the expression of Angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE2) and decreases the expression of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)
signaling mediator ACE1, potentially linking these pathways. Intriguingly, our evidence also demonstrates that
1) Apelin and ACE2 are decreased in PH models and cells 2) ACE1 is increased, and 3) Apelin receptor nuclear
localization in control but not PH patient RV tissue and cells, suggesting a possible mechanism of action.
However, the interaction between these pathways during RV failure and whether Apelin-mediated RV adaptation
is dependent on enhancement of ACE2 signaling remains elusive. Based on these findings, we put forward the
hypothesis that Apelin signaling abrogates PH-induced RV-pulmonary artery (PA) uncoupling by inhibiting RAAS
and enhancing ACE2 signaling. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) To determine if Apelin
receptor-mediated signaling promotes RV adaptative remodeling and survival through the inhibition of RAAS
and activation of ACE2 2) To demonstrate that impaired nuclear localization of the Apelin receptor (APLNR)
contributes to RV failure and PH development 3) To identify whether Apelin-mediated inhibition of RAAS and
enhancement of ACE2 abrogates pulmonary vascular remodeling. The proposed studies are significant; they
will ascertain whether Apelin is a critical mediator of RV adaptive remodeling in PH, which if true, may establish
a novel and therapeutically targetable Apelin-mediated signaling axis in the RV. Targeting Apelin signaling is of
particular importance: inhibition of RAAS signaling has led to mixed clinical outcomes in PH patients and drug
delivery of ACE2 remains a substantial challenge. In contrast, recent industry interest has led to the development
of several orally deliverable Apelin/APLNR agonists, therefore, if Apelin protection against PH is dependent on
RAAS inhibition and enhancement of ACE2 in the RV and pulmonary vasculature, it would provide the rationale
to use these novel Apelin/APLNR agonists to target RAAS, ACE2 and treat PH. Upon completion of the proposed
studies, we will have demonstrated that by leveraging the Apelin signaling pathway, we can promote RV adaptive
remodeling. Identification of pathways and targets engaged by Apelin during RV failure will allow for the
development of novel, long-acting and targeted treatment strategies for the PA-RV circuit."

Our mechanistic understanding of small (<150 nt) self-cleaving nucleolytic ribozymes that primarily use general-
acid base catalysis involving attack of the 2’-OH on the adjacent scissile phosphate to site-specifically cleave
the intervening phosphodiester backbone has initially focused on hammerhead, hairpin, glmS, hepatitis delta
virus and Varkud Satellite ribozymes, and more recently on twister (Twr), twister-sister (TSr), pistol (Psr) and
hatchet (Htr) ribozymes. Our overall goal as reflected from our structure-function studies of the Twr, Tsr, Psr and
Htr ribozymes is to expand on our current understanding of the catalytic versatility of RNA with the emphasis on
the contributions of active site organization, geometric constraints, activation of the 2’-OH nucleophile, the role
of transition state stabilization, protonation of the 5’-oxygen leaving group and the potential of Mg2+ cations in
mediating catalysis. One of the challenges in the field relates to whether self-cleaving ribozymes use a common
or diverse set of mechanisms, and the extent to which hydrated divalent cations catalyze cleavage chemistry.
We have an ongoing collaboration with the Ronald Micura lab (Innsbruck) to study catalytic mechanisms of self-
cleaving ribozymes by solving crystal structures of precatalytic, transition and product states in our lab, followed
by systematic multi-faceted studies of structure-guided selective catalytic mutants and analogs, as well as pKa
measurements of catalytic residues, and pH and temperature-dependence of catalytic rates by the Micura lab.
Aim 1: A recent biochemical genome-wide screen resulted in the identification of the naturally occurring self-
cleaving hovlinc ribozyme in humans. The sequence of the 168-nt hovlinc ribozyme and its 83-nt minimal
functional counterpart contained two pseudoknots with one of them embedded in the cleavage site. The cleavage
rate was shown to increase with pH and its inverse correlation with the pKa of divalent cations suggested the
catalytic participation of a hydrated divalent cation in cleavage chemistry. We propose to crystallize and
determine the structures of the precatalytic, vanadate transition-state mimic and product states of the minimal
functional hovlinc ribozyme and follow up with systematic functional studies with the Micura lab of structure-
guided modifications and rate measurements towards elucidation of its catalytic cleavage mechanism.
Aim 2. This Aim revisits structure-activity relationships of the Twr and TSr ribozymes to resolve discrepancies
in the published precatalytic structures and resulting mechanistic insights reported in the literature. The splayed-
apart orientation of bases at the cleavage site in a four-way junctional TSr ribozyme by our group contrasts with
the stacked bases at the cleavage site in a three-way junctional TSr from the David Lilley lab. We propose to
characterize vanadate transition-state mimics of the Twr and TSr ribozymes to resolve the existing discrepancies
and mechanistically evaluate the proposed role of catalytic bases and hydrated divalent cations in mediating
cleavage chemistry. These studies should elucidate whether Twr and TSr ribozymes, that contain common but
topologically distinct conserved sequence elements, use similar or distinct mechanisms for cleavage chemistry."

Overview: The goal of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a home-based advance care planning
(ACP) video intervention for improving ACP conversations, resuscitation preference documentation, hospice
utilization, and reducing cost of care for patients with life-limiting illness receiving care in the home setting.
Background: The number of patients living with serious chronic illness and receiving home-based care through
Medicare's House Call Providers program is increasing. Often, these patients lack exposure to specialty palliative
care and too frequently receive inpatient palliative care consultations late in the illness trajectory. A large portion
of these inpatient specialty palliative care consults are focused exclusively to support ACP documentation, and
addressing end-of-life (EOL) care needs for this population. Health care systems require evidence-based ap-
proaches that promote these focused palliative care services at home while surmounting challenges such as
palliative care workforce shortage. We have developed a video-assisted, home-based ACP intervention (Home-
ACP) to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-cen-
tered and less costly care at the EOL. Home-ACP combines two evidence-based features including 1) predictive
analytics to identify patients with an advanced serious illness and a projected prognosis of one year or less; and
2) ACP video decision aid delivered by a nurse as part of Clover Health's House Call Provider program. Our
prior work has shown the efficacy of ACP videos in several randomized trials, but have not examined their effect
in the home setting. The video is available in 25 languages and scripted at a low literacy level.
Research Plan: We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial of the Home-ACP intervention versus usual
care in 500 patients with life-limiting illness and a prognosis of one year or less, receiving home-based care. We
will assess the effectiveness of the Home-ACP intervention for preferences for resuscitation, ACP documenta-
tion, and hospice utilization. We will also compare patient-reported outcomes in a subset of 200 patients including
ACP knowledge, confidence in future care, communication satisfaction, and decisional certainty. Lastly, we will
compare the cost of care in the last year of life for patients receiving the Home-ACP intervention versus usual
care.
Environment: This project will be conducted with the support of the Clover Health House Call Providers pro-
gram, which has the resources, infrastructure, and electronic health record capabilities to ensure the success of
this trial. Patients will be recruited from 17 counties in New Jersey with substantial ethnic and racial diversity.
The investigative research team has the expertise in developing and testing video decision aids and palliative
care interventions in large multi-site national trials.
Relevance of Research: This project will establish the foundation of a future implementation and dissemination
pragmatic trial including tens of thousands of patients in House Call Provider programs across the country."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes a wide spectrum of lymphomas including Hodgkin, Burkitt, and diffuse large
cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The proportion of EBV+ lymphomas rises sharply as does morbidity and mortality in
HIV-infected persons despite combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), suggesting specific failure to control viral
driven lymphomas. However, the mechanistic processes contributing to EBV-driven lymphomagenesis remain
poorly understood. This proposal will investigate a conceptually novel hypothesis that the LMP2A viral
oncogene interacts with the B cell receptor (BCR), serving to maintain it in its growth promoting IgM isotype.
This hypothesis predicts that EBV transformed cells expressing LMP2A are dependent upon their constitutive
activation of cellular mediators of antigen-induced signaling, and thus will be susceptible to agents that target
this signaling cascade, whereas EBV-transformed cells that do not express LMP2A will be resistant to such
drugs. Our proposal stems from two exciting observations that we have made about lymphoblastoid cells
(LCLs) transformed by an EBV mutant that lacks LMP2A (∆LMP2A-EBV). First, we discovered that, unlike
normal LCLs, the growth of ∆LMP2A-LCLs is not dependent on mediators of antigen-induced signaling like
BLNK and BTK. Second, in contrast to normal LCLs, ∆LMP2A-LCLs fail to maintain the growth promoting IgM
form of the BCR and instead express the IgG-BCR. Since antigen signaling through IgG-BCR promotes
differentiation into plasma cells which secrete high levels of antibodies but have limited proliferative potential,
our central hypothesis is that LMP2A contributes to lymphomagenesis by facilitating outgrowth of EBV
transformed B lymphocytes expressing the growth promoting IgM-BCR. This proposal will analyze mechanistic
pathways and gene expression profiles in EBV-transformed LCLs and test lymphoma formation in humanized
mice in order to distinguish the direct contributions of LMP2A from those mediated by the IgM-BCR, and
assess the therapeutic vulnerability that arise from each. Specifically, we will (1) Investigate intersection of
LMP2A and BCR Ig isotype on B lymphocyte transformation, (2) Characterize impact of antigenic stimulation in
the presence or absence of LMP2A expression, and (3) Determine LMP2A-mediated susceptibility to
therapeutic inhibition of signaling molecules. Together these studies provide a framework for how LMP2A
interacts with the BCR to promote EBV transformation and provide new opportunities for therapeutic
intervention in EBV-associated lymphomas."

Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is one of the most effective interventions for treating gender dys-
phoria in transgender and gender nonconforming (hereafter transgender) youth, thereby reducing suicide risk.
GAHT, particularly estrogen, may increase the risk of thrombosis. While hematologists often evaluate patients
before GAHT start who are at risk of thrombosis due to personal/family risk factors, there are no guidelines or
data to inform management. This lack of data leads to significant variation in clinical practice that may com-
promise care. Because this knowledge gap hinders the ability of gender care clinicians and hematologists to
provide optimal care to transgender youth, the objectives of this proposal are to prospectively examine biologic
changes associated with thrombotic risk in a cohort of transgender youth receiving estrogen GAHT and to ex-
amine the attitudes and practices of clinicians who make decisions about thromboprophylaxis for youth on
GAHT. The proposed work is relevant to the priorities of understanding human biology (defining changes in
thrombotic risk associated with estrogen GAHT) and reducing human disease (defining which transgender
youth may benefit from thromboprophylaxis). The proposed research is innovative in the focus on transgender
youth, comprehensive examination of changes in coagulation factors in youth using estrogen GAHT, and de-
termination of factors influencing the treatment recommendations of hematologists for thromboprophylaxis
among transgender youth with personal/family risk factors for thrombosis. The specific aims are to: 1) prospec-
tively determine changes in coagulation that would predispose to thrombosis over the first 24 months of estro-
gen GAHT in a population of transgender women (up to age 22 years at GAHT start); and 2) characterize the
attitudes, practices, and intentions of hematologists caring for youth toward recommending thromboprophylaxis
to TG youth with personal/family risk factors for thrombosis. In Aim 1, 75 transgender women up to 22 years of
age who are starting estrogen GAHT will undergo thorough and systematic evaluation of hemostatic factors at
baseline prior to GAHT start, and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with interim telephone study visits. Hor-
mone usage and adherence, coagulation parameters, thrombophilia polymorphisms, and platelet activation will
be assessed. In Aim 2, well-established qualitative and survey research methods will be used. Up to 20 adult
and pediatric hematologists will complete individual interviews. Data from these interviews will be used to gen-
erate items for a new survey that will undergo survey development methods (cognitive interviews, pilot testing)
before being fielded to a sample of U.S. and Canadian hematologists to understand their attitudes, behaviors,
and intentions to recommend thromboprophylaxis to transgender youth at risk for thrombosis and factors asso-
ciated with these intentions. The results of this work provide the foundation for 1) an intervention targeting phy-
sicians to improve knowledge of thrombosis risk in the setting of GAHT and 2) development of clinical guid-
ance to aid in referral, evaluation, and management of transgender youth at risk for thrombosis."

Despite recent technological advances, on-treatment imaging for radiotherapy procedures is still a significant
challenge for tens of thousands of patients. On-board MRI or kV x-ray systems are either prohibitively
expensive, provide incomplete information, or are incompatible with implanted metal devices. According to the
American College of Radiology, megavoltage (MV) volumetric imaging has a clear advantage in terms of metal
artifact reduction, direct dose calculation and real-time adaptive radiotherapy, but is challenged by low contrast
and high imaging doses. We have demonstrated that this limitation can be overcome by a novel multi-layer
imager to provide high-contrast, low-dose on-treatment MV imaging. This new technology will remove metal
artifacts while retaining soft-tissue contrast and enable real-time adaptive radiotherapy. We have invented and
validated a Monte Carlo-based tool that enables accurate image simulation in a fraction of the time required for
conventional Monte Carlo simulation – enabling efficient imager optimization to be performed. Our preliminary
data with a novel low-cost scintillator and efficient layering combinations has already demonstrated low-
dose/high-quality MV-CBCT, rivaling conventional kV-CBCT, with added benefits of artifact reduction and
Hounsfield unit accuracy. The Specific Aims of the current proposal will leverage our combined experience and
previous results to produce an optimized imager suitable for widespread clinical use.

This proposal describes a 5-year research plan to adapt and evaluate implementation of three
evidence-based interventions to achieve the goals of Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) in Alabama (AL).
This combination intervention will (1) use novel big data approaches to inform precision public health
efforts to increase testing in priority populations, (2) decrease time to linkage to care, and (3) decrease
time to viral suppression (VS) among persons newly diagnosed with HIV in AL, a priority state in the
national EHE Initiative. The proposal leverages a dynamic and innovative collaboration of experienced
investigators from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR)
and the HIV Divisions of the state health department in AL (ADPH) and the Mobile County Health
Department (MCHD). The MCHD serves six predominantly rural counties in the southwestern region
of AL with low testing coverage, high incidence, and suboptimal times to linkage and VS for newly
diagnosed cases of HIV. We propose a type 2 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) frameworks to adapt, implement, and evaluate three
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) evidence-based interventions: (1) a data-driven approach to direct
Community-based HIV testing in areas with low testing coverage, (2) Project Connect, to expedite
linkage at time of diagnosis and (3) a Rapid ART start program at MCHD community clinics in Alabama
(“COAST-AL”). In Aim 1, we will use qualitative methods to adapt COAST-AL combination intervention
to the local context. In Aim 2, we will deploy the adapted intervention across MCHD services areas
over 36 months. Our primary effectiveness outcome is days to VS after HIV diagnosis using state-level
surveillance data from ADPH. Our primary implementation outcome is proportion of zip code tabulation
areas with at least 15% of the adult population tested by 36 months compared to baseline using
surveillance and commercial HIV testing data sets. We will evaluate intervention acceptability,
feasibility, appropriateness from clients through in-depth interviews and with providers through surveys.
In Aim 3 we will conduct interviews with key stakeholders and work collaboratively with local and state
health department stakeholders to identify and prioritize implementation strategies that can be deployed
to sustain COAST-AL and facilitate its implementation in other public health jurisdictions across AL and
other rural EHE-prioritized states. Results of this research will lay the groundwork for a larger
implementation trial that will include rigorous evaluation of implementation strategies to integrate
COAST-AL into clinical and public health systems to meet EHE targets."
10878914,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Elucidation of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie normal blood cell development is an
important prerequisite for understanding and treating hematopoietic disorders such as leukemias. Drosophila
has proven to be an extremely powerful system for genetic dissection of such mechanisms, which are
remarkably conserved in mammals. This study uses the excellent genetic tools available in Drosophila to
address specific questions related to how the balance between progenitors and differentiated cells is achieved.
Preliminary data suggests that the tight coupling between cell-cycle regulation and differentiation pathways in
progenitors plays an important role in determining the balance of progenitors and differentiated cells. In
addition, two signals that originate in distinct transitory populations define parallel paths of hematopoietic
development, and we hypothesize that they subsequently affect the balance between progenitor maintenance
and differentiation that is crucial for homeostasis. These mechanisms will be explored in three aims. In Aim 1,
a thorough genetic analysis will be aimed towards obtaining evidence for the spatiotemporal developmental
mechanisms that generate parallel paths in hematopoiesis. The genetic data will be fully integrated
with transcriptomic analysis to determine how the system generates lineage biases in cells with related, but
not identical transcriptomes. In Aim 2, the signals that distinguish the two transitory populations will be
explored as will the downstream effects of these signals on the balance between progenitor maintenance and
differentiation. This will involve the genetic dissection of a JNK-related and a PVR-related signal that are
unique attributes of each transitory population. Lastly, in Aim 3, a genetic/functional analysis of integrated Hh-
and Wnt6-dependent pathways that control the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation will be
investigated. The role of Wnt6 in controlling cell growth and oxidative status of the progenitors will be tested to
obtain a mechanistic understanding of how and why the control of cell cycle and differentiation are closely and
directly linked to each other. Overall, the proposed research will yield important insights into the fundamental
mechanisms that govern the balance between the opposing forces of progenitor maintenance and
differentiation in blood cell development. As these pathways are conserved in humans, this analysis will help
bridge the gap between broadly available descriptions of genetic control during hematopoiesis with the less
well-defined in vivo functional relevance of such genetic networks to the controlled process of hematopoiesis
during homeostatic conditions and the genetic perturbations that lead to blood disorders. These experiments,
done in the Drosophila model, will further our understanding of, and provide guidance for, future analysis of
blood development and disorders in humans."
10878919,"My laboratory’s research projects combine my expertise in polymer science and biology to develop precise
synthetic tools for problems at biomaterial interfaces. We approach these problems by designing materials from
the “bottom up,” which is the idea that macroscale properties arise from the collection of interactions that occur
at the molecular scale, nanoscale, and microscale. Our projects seek to program precise macroscale properties
by controlling molecular assembly, and we then use the new substrates to ask questions about muscle, immune,
and connective tissue biology using in vitro tissue culture and in vivo models. As an example, our ongoing work
advances this goal by synthesizing cytocompatible liquid crystalline substrates to ask questions about how
variations in viscoelasticity at subcellular, cellular, and supercellular length scales impact cellular responses.
 This MIRA program is motivated by the idea that brush-like polymer surfaces have significant and untapped
potential as biomaterials. The concept features the spatially-controlled growth of polymers from natural
biomaterial surfaces using synthetic methods to control the composition, connectivity, and morphology of the
polymers. At a minimum, the projects will establish a new synthetic platform for brush-like polymers on silk fibroin
substrates (films and particles) and will use the platform to generate new knowledge of brush-brush and brush-
cell associations to tune interactions with implanted materials. In addition, the projects are unified in their goals
to develop the brush-like polymer architecture for local drug delivery with specific focus on the anesthetic
bupivacaine. Bupivacaine solutions are often applied directly at a surgical site to treat post-operative pain. While
many bupivacaine formulations have been tested, nearly all rely on the diffusion of free drug or drug
encapsulated in a polymer. No formulation achieves the sustained release required for postoperative pain, and
repeat bupivacaine administration is prohibited due to cardiac toxicity, creating a critical treatment gap.
 These projects build upon our recent successes generating high degrees of functionalization on purified silk
fibroin, a protein whose composition and secondary structure often frustrate modification efforts. Over the next
five years, we will synthesize brush-like polymers of varying composition to quantify how the brush morphology
and connectivity with neighbors affect the loading and release of varying drugs. Using release data to generate
pharmacokinetic models and statistical analysis, we will rationally design multi-composition brushes for the
phased release of local anesthetic to establish the brushes’ delivery efficacy and impact on tissues in an in vivo
mouse model of surgical pain. Finally, injectable brush formulations will be generated on particles of varying
shapes and sizes to establish how the polymer architecture impacts phagocytosis, targeting of specific cell types,
and efficacy in a nerve block model. Ultimately, we will build upon our efforts to discover new, well-controlled
polymer designs that alter protein interactions and cellular responses to feed into our lab’s broader goals to use
materials to engineer immune responses and enhance integration with surrounding tissues."

We will establish a new Pittsburgh Craniofacial Sciences Training Program (PCSTP) at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (Pitt Dental) to train and mentor a new generation of leaders in Dental
Oral and Craniofacial (DOC) sciences. Our goal is to address the critical shortage of craniofacial
biologists nationwide through the PCSTP. Pitt Dental is an ideal academic setting for a high-caliber
program, including strong institutional investment in internationally recognized research programs in
craniofacial genetics and regenerative medicine. Indeed, Pitt Dental has ranked in the top 10 dental schools
receiving NIDCR funding each of the past 6 years, while the University has ranked 6th or higher nationally in
total NIH funding for more than a decade. Concerted efforts to grow the research enterprise at Pitt Dental over
the last 15 years led to a doubling in the number of accomplished research faculty and the completion of a new
state-of-the-art research tower in 2015. The thriving Pitt Dental research ecosystem is multi- and
interdisciplinary and team-based. Our current oral and craniofacial sciences trainees work alongside PhD
students from the Departments of Bioengineering (School of Engineering) and Human Genetics (Graduate
School of Public Health), all of whom identify themselves as craniofacial scientists. Pitt Dental leadership fully
recognizes the strategic importance of our program and has committed significant resources in personnel and
support for the students in the PCSTP. The PCSTP will be administered and managed in the Department of
Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, with additional faculty from other Pitt Dental or University departments
(primarily Prosthodontics, Human Genetics, and Bioengineering). Trainees will be admitted to the Oral and
Craniofacial Sciences PhD program, and following the completion of their first year (supported by Pitt Dental),
the strongest students will be considered for acceptance into the PCSTP. Postdoctoral trainees can apply to
participate in either the conventional postdoctoral training or enroll in the PhD program for individuals holding a
DDS/DMD. Finally, the R90 component will provide opportunities for individuals with foreign DDS/DMD
degrees to participate. The PCSTP provides courses, research experiences, seminar series, journal clubs, an
annual symposium, and an annual retreat (for PCSTP trainees and faculty only) and will leverage University
resources, such as training in artificial intelligence, data science and the responsible conduct of research
(RCR) and in methods to enhance reproducibility. Our trainees will benefit from a wealth of mentors, seminars,
conferences, shared facilities, intramural pilot awards, and specialized training and experiences available
through hundreds of laboratories and clinics across the six schools of the health sciences and the Pitt Clinical
and Translational Sciences Institute (including its RCR Center and Institute for Clinical Research Education)."
10878769,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Epigenetic processes have been implicated in control of cardiac development and in the incidence and
progression of disease. Heart failure in particular has been shown to involve the actions of chromatin remodeling
enzymes and to proceed by temporal reorganization of histone modifications and gene expression. The scientific
premise of this application is that understanding the principles of chromatin structure-function, including the roles
of specific molecular targets such as the linker histone H1 family, is key to re-engineering healthy transcriptomes
in the setting of disease. Based on preliminary data implicating its role in fibroblast phenotype, we will
mechanistically investigate the role of linker histone H1.0 in chromatin organization, using gain- and loss-of-
function approaches in cells and in vivo. We hypothesize that precise structural orientation of the genome is
underpinned by cell type-specific molecular processes and that disease results from reorganization of global
genome architecture, thereby enabling pathologic gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the
first ever reconstruction of genome topology on distinct cell types—fibroblasts and myocytes—from the same
organ. We will precisely measure differences in chromatin architecture in fibroblast nuclei from male and female
mice, examining the role of sex differences in genome organization as a potential unexplored contributor to
differences in gene expression and cardiovascular phenotype between the sexes. We will use dCas CLOuD9-
based chromatin loop reorganization tools to definitively test the causative role of chromatin interactions in
transcription and fibroblast activation. Based on preliminary data implicating a privileged role for linker histone
H1.0 in cardiac fibroblasts, we will examine the molecular mechanisms whereby H1.0 controls fibroblast gene
expression and locus specific chromatin accessibility. We will use gain- and loss-of-function approaches in
isolated fibroblasts to examine the role of histone H1.0 to regulate nuclear condensation, fibroblast gel
contraction, proliferation and myofibroblast protein expression. We will conclusively determine the in vivo role of
histone H1.0 in cardiac fibroblast phenotype under basal conditions and in the setting of pressure overload, beta
adrenergic stress by isoproterenol, or ischemic injury. This approach will allow us to test the role of histone H1.0
to regulate assembly of specific chromatin neighborhoods identified in our genome structure studies as well as
to examine whether these neighborhoods are reorganized in a histone H1.0-dependent manner in vivo
concomitant with development of disease. The proposed experiments will provide mechanistic insights into how
histone H1.0 contributes to fibroblast activation and cardiac function in vivo, revealing molecular details
underpinning epigenetic control of the heart’s response to injury."
10878775,"Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a pathogenic, tick-transmitted
bunyavirus that can cause a severe febrile hemorrhagic-like disease with case fatality rates of
up to 30%. Discovered during a 2009 outbreak of febrile illness in China, the geographic
distribution of SFTSV extends into Korea and Japan with recent reports of infection in Vietnam
and Russia. The tick vector for SFTSV is widespread throughout Asia. Numerous domestic and
wild animals are naturally infected by SFTSV suggesting a large reservoir with potential spillover
to humans. There are currently no vaccines or therapeutics for SFTSV. Because of its epidemic
threat the WHO included SFTSV in its 2017 recommendation “A research and development
Blueprint for action to prevent epidemics” and identified SFTSV as one of 11 pathogens most
likely to cause severe outbreaks in the near future and proposed development of vaccines. Here
we will explore two complementary and potentially synergistic strategies for an SFTSV vaccine:
a recombinant viral vector and nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the SFTSV viral
glycoproteins. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a cytopathic virus that has been developed as
a vaccine vector due to its ability to rapidly induce strong, protective antibody and T cell
responses to encoded foreign antigens after a single dose. Using a VSV vector expressing the
SFTSV viral glycoproteins (similar to the currently employed VSV-Ebola vaccine), we
demonstrate single dose induction of a neutralizing antibody response and protection from
SFTSV challenge in an IFNAR1 knockout mouse model. Separately, we show that vaccination
of wt mice with a single dose of nucleoside-modified mRNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP)
encoding the SFTSV glycoproteins elicits high levels of SFTSV neutralizing antibodies that are
capable of conferring partial SFTSV protection when transferred into the IFNAR1 KO model.
Based upon these strong preliminary findings we propose to characterize antibody and T-cell
responses in rVSV and mRNA vaccinated mice when these vaccines are used alone or in a
prime-boost regimen. These studies are significant as there is limited knowledge regarding
vaccines for this highly pathogenic virus (a single report) and use of rVSV and mRNA in a
prime-boost vaccination has not been reported. Finally, current small animal models of SFTSV
infection are limited to animals with type I IFN responses knocked out. Because these animals
lack an important innate immune response mechanism that supports amplification of cellular
and humoral immune responses, we will develop an immune competent mouse vaccination
model using transient monoclonal antibody blockade of IFNAR1 during SFTSV challenge."

The Hematology Research Training Program at the University of Washington is designed to provide intensive
post-doctoral research training in investigative hematology. Although the program emphasizes cell and molecular
biology, and has well-established strengths in stem cells, hematopoiesis, cell and gene therapy, platelets and
hemostasis, the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies, and hematopoietic cell transplantation; clinical
research and outcomes investigation are also supported and encouraged. Program faculty include established
investigators with strong independent research programs from both basic science and clinical departments of
the University of Washington. The faculty is based at the University of Washington campuses, the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, BloodWorks NW, Harborview Medical Center, the VA Puget Sound Health
Care System, and Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute. The goal of the training program is to develop
the research, presentation, and grant-writing skills that trainees will need to establish independent research
careers, and to train future leaders in research hematology. Trainees have MD, MD/PhD or PhD degrees. Many
have completed clinical fellowship training in hematology, but others are basic researchers wishing to work in
the field. Trainees are chosen through an application process and interviews with program faculty. They obtain
research experience by working with a mentor, and gain skills in laboratory and/or clinical investigation, data
analysis, publishing papers, presentation, and acquiring independent grant support. Bidirectional translational
projects (bench to bedside and bedside to bench) are encouraged. Trainees typically receive two years of funding
from the T32 program, but often continue their training longer under separate funding mechanisms, including
K12, K23, K08 or K99R00 grants and foundation support. Training progress is monitored by the faculty mentor,
a separate faculty advisor, the Program Directors, and the Division of Hematology faculty through regular
research presentations, meetings with each trainee, and written evaluations. Each six months, trainees update
their individual development plan (IDP) and formally present their research progress and career goals to a
Research Oversight Committee (ROC) consisting of the trainee's mentors and the T32 PI. 100% and 83% of
trainees who completed our program over the past 5 and 10 years, respectively, have academic medicine or
industry research careers. Strengths of the program include: the diverse research opportunities, a qualified
prominent senior faculty, the inclusion and mentorship of talented junior faculty, the structured mentorship of
trainees, the inclusion of under-represented minority trainees, strong and varied didactic sessions, and a long
track record spanning over five decades of training graduates that subsequently obtain academic (or industry)
research positions and become independent, distinguished investigators and thought-leaders throughout
hematology."
10878779,"There is substantial need to improve treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Buspirone is a mechanistically
supported medication with robust preclinical and preliminary clinical support for treating opioid withdrawal and
decreasing relapse. Buspirone has the utility to treat both acute and protracted withdrawal periods. We are
experts in the measurement, evaluation and treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms and have recently
completed an RCT pilot study (n=16) which provides the initial safety, feasibility, and efficacy data to support a
more thorough evaluation of buspirone to mitigate withdrawal when administered as an adjunct to a residential
stepwise opioid taper. We propose a rigorous, Phase II, three-group, placebo-controlled double-blind RCT to
evaluate the efficacy of buspirone for (1) acute withdrawal as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy to a residential
opioid stepwise taper and (2) protracted withdrawal during an outpatient phase following taper completion.
During the 12-day residential phase, 100 participants with OUD will be enrolled, stabilized on morphine,
undergo a morphine stepwise taper, and complete a post-taper observation period where they will have the
opportunity to initiate long-term buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone. The outpatient phase will take
place over the course of a 4-week period and will consist of weekly in-person visits and daily diary reports of
their withdrawal and craving severity and anxiety. Individuals with OUD (n=100) will be randomized to one of
three groups (1) buspirone during both residential and outpatient phases, (2) buspirone during the residential
phase and placebo during the outpatient phase, and (3) placebo during both the residential and outpatient
phases. We aim to complete 90 participants (30/group). We will collect measures of withdrawal, craving
(acute and tonic), anxiety, medication acceptability, and biochemical measures of opioid use. Primary Aim 1
evaluates the impact of buspirone on acute and protracted withdrawal. We hypothesize participants who
receive buspirone during both the residential and outpatient phases of the study will have the lowest overall
opioid withdrawal severity. Primary Aim 2 evaluates the impact of buspirone on acute and tonic craving.
We hypothesize participants that receive buspirone during both residential and outpatient phases will have the
lowest tonic craving and that participants will show significantly lower acute craving when they are actively
receiving buspirone. Primary Aim 3 evaluates whether retention and relapse prevention are impacted by
buspirone. We hypothesize that buspirone used during a residential opioid taper will increase treatment
retention and that buspirone used during the outpatient phase will decrease rates of relapse. Primary Aim 4
evaluates whether buspirone mitigates anxiety during residential and outpatient treatment for opioid
use disorder. We hypothesize that buspirone will show modest reductions in anxiety during residential and
outpatient treatment. This study will collect the data needed to determine whether buspirone is an effective
method for improving treatment outcomes for OUD during acute and protracted opioid withdrawal periods."
10878928,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have higher healthcare utilization, reduced work productivity, reduced quality-
adjusted life years, and lower health-related quality of life (QOL) relative to the general population. The current
standard of outpatient MS care depends on in-clinic visits, but MS patients face many barriers to accessing this
care. These barriers include those resulting from the disease itself, such as physical limitations, driving
restrictions and financial limitations, and they are further compounded by an overall shortage of neurologists.
Furthermore, MS care has a significant economic impact, with the estimated indirect and direct costs for treating
MS in the US estimated to be > $48 billion. Therefore, there is a need to improve access to and reduce cost of
MS care, and telehealth is a potential solution. Both our two multidisciplinary MS Centers (UCSF and Cleveland
Clinic) have demonstrated that telehealth for MS care is feasible and that it results in travel savings for patients,
reduction in missed work, and reduction in caregiver burden. Additionally, patient and provider satisfaction is
high for this modality of care at the time of care delivery. These initial results are promising, but to date there are
no studies assessing the longer-term impact of care delivery via telehealth on the Quadruple Aims of Healthcare:
clinical care, cost, patient experience and clinician experience.
The proposed study will directly bridge these research gaps in the longer-term impact of care delivery via
telehealth. We will complete a two-Center trial, randomizing newly diagnosed MS patients to receive their routine
MS care via telehealth or standard in-office care over 2 years. We will enroll 120 patients (assuming ~ 20%
dropout rate for 100 completers), and will assess and compare standard clinical outcomes, patient-reported
outcomes, costs, patient experience, and clinician care team experience associated with telehealth vs standard
in clinic care. We will also conduct exit interviews with purposefully sampled trial participants to better identify
facilitators and barriers to telehealth implementation. This study will generate needed evidence regarding the
impact of telehealth on clinical outcomes, its cost, and stakeholder experience, and will inform clinical care
implementation in other populations of MS patients and other chronic conditions."

Intrinsically disordered proteins and disordered regions (collectively termed IDPs) perform vital biological
functions in transcriptional regulation, cell differentiation, and DNA condensation. IDPs rapidly interconvert
between different conformations, imparting plasticity, forming transient contacts and promoting allostery. IDPs
also participate in phase transitions, forming liquid droplets. The droplets facilitate diverse biological processes
that require localization in different regions in the cell. Yet, principles for understanding how a protein's
sequence shapes its ensemble of disordered conformations to perform its function and to promote phase
separation are still lacking. While the simple metric of amino acid composition explains broad conformational
features (radius, scaling exponents) and trends, minor variations in sequence, caused by post-translational
modifications (PTMs)/mutations can drastically alter disordered conformations and their functions. IDPs also
elude traditional sequence alignment tools to classify functionally similar proteins across species.
We propose to build a novel computational framework based on physico-chemical principles to describe the
ensemble of disordered conformations for IDPs with arbitrary sequence. To understand how PTMs/mutations
couple with diverse solution conditions to alter IDP conformation and the propensity of IDPs to phase separate,
we need computationally efficient models. The models must be capable of handling the combinatorial
challenge of analyzing multiple sequences and their variants due to preferential mutations/modifications,
alternate splicing under diverse conditions. The same challenge is faced when seeking evolutionary signatures
of multiple sequences across different species. An integrated approach combining polymer physics, all-atom
simulation, and multiple experiments will build coarse-grain models for such high-throughput analysis.
The proposed theoretical approach will i) provide guidance to determine how IDP conformations differ in vitro
and in vivo, ii) harness limited data (smFRET between specific probes) to make predictions for distances
between arbitrary residue pairs and iii) build a rigorous framework for comparing residue-pair specific
interaction parameters between different force fields and experiments, and suggest improvements, if needed.
The computationally efficient formalism will be applied at a large scale to provide a detailed description of
conformational ensembles, including residue-pair specific distance maps (beyond simple observables as
radius of gyration, end-to-end-distance, scaling exponents) for sets of disordered proteins to understand
functional similarities/dissimilarities, not possible by sequence alignment alone. The formalism will also quantify
IDP's susceptibility to chemical modifications/mutations, and environmental changes (pH, salinity) to alter
conformations, function and promote or suppress phase separation propensities in IDP solutions."

Project Summary
Over the past decade there has been a revolution in imaging technology and its application to basic
biomedical research. The Imaging Core Module will be a critical resource in bringing this technology to the
vision research community at Yale. Advanced imaging equipment is expensive and typically cannot be
purchased and maintained with the resources of a single investigator. Moreover, with the nearly complete
conversion of imaging to advanced optics and digital methods, sophisticated data acquisition and analysis
techniques are required to quantitatively examine visual system structure, development and function. The
Yale Vision Core Program, through this Imaging module, will provide access to state-of-the-art imaging
technologies and the necessary training in advanced imaging approaches for vision investigators at Yale.
The Imaging Core module's primary goal is to facilitate the wide use of advanced optical and digital imaging
techniques within the Yale vision research community. This is achieved by three means. First, Yale School
of Medicine and the Departments of Neuroscience and Ophthalmology & Visual Science have made and
will continue to make a significant investment in advanced imaging microscopes, which Vision Core
investigators will gain free access to through the Yale Vision Core. Second, a Support Scientist, Dr. Stacy
Wilson, who is an expert in optics and digital imaging techniques, will provide technical support in the proper
use of the microscopes and digital imaging. Third, the Core module will train Vision Core scientists
(students, postdocs) in appropriate microscopy techniques and advanced digital image analysis. We
anticipate that the Imaging Core module will play an important role in the research success of vision
investigators at Yale University."

Post-viral bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of death in pandemics. Since we use different strategies to
fight viruses and bacteria, host innate immune responses are confused and impaired when both types of infection
occur simultaneously, resulting in higher mortality in post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Determining the key events
in the initial viral infection that disturb the subsequent antibacterial responses will guide therapies in treating
post-viral bacterial pneumonia. STAT2, as a critical component of IFN-I signaling, is essential for the antiviral
response, but elicits detrimental effects in antibacterial response though yet-unknown mechanisms. We
discovered a novel T403 phosphorylation of STAT2, stimulated by virus infections, enabling an efficient
antiviral response in infected cells. This project sheds new light on the role of STAT2 T403 phosphorylation in
the pathogenesis of post-viral bacterial pneumonia from two perspectives: (1) the action of IFN: IFN-I is essential
to limit viral dissemination, but with enigmatic functions in the subsequent bacterial infection. As the critical
component in IFN-I signaling, STAT2 suppresses bacterial clearance during IAV-bacterial co-infection. Our
recent discovery provides structural insight into how T403 phosphorylation, induced by prior viral infection,
primes IFN-I signaling in macrophages and neutrophils, which may explain IFN-associated increased
susceptibility to bacterial infection. (2) the regulation of inflammation: Viral infection increases progression of
secondary bacterial sepsis 6-fold. We discovered that STAT2 T403 phosphorylation promotes NF-κB-driven
inflammatory response in macrophages. In agreement with this finding, our preliminary data show that blocking
STAT2 T403 phosphorylation protects mice from bacterially-induced sepsis. These findings suggest T403
phosphorylation plays a critical role in promoting proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages thereby
exacerbating inflammation-associated lung injury. In conclusion, we hypothesize that T403 phosphorylation
of STAT2 is a post-viral infection event that impairs bacterial clearance and exacerbates the severity of
inflammation-associated lung injury in subsequent bacterial pneumonia. This project will carry our
understanding from structural and mechanistic analyses forward to phenotypic changes in vitro and in vivo. We
will determine the kinetics of virus-induced T403 phosphorylation in mice and investigate its correlation with lung
injury prognosis in ARDS patients. Since macrophages and neutrophils are the key responders to bacterial
infection, we will focus on determining the impact of T403 phosphorylation on their functions in bacterially induced
lung injury. Finally, we will determine how T403 phosphorylation contributes to the development of post-IAV
bacterial pneumonia and evaluate the ability of a clinical TBK1/IKK-i inhibitor that blocks STAT2 T403
phosphorylation to ameliorate lung injury in our model. Completion of this project will allow us to comprehensively
analyze this new regulatory mechanism in bacterially induced lung injury, and potentially to develop T403
phosphorylation as a critical biomarker and potential therapeutic target in post-viral bacterial pneumonia."

 3 Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is approved for three central nervous system disorders. Despite promising
 4 preclinical evidence of success amelioration of heart failure, several large patient trials have failed to meet
 5 designated endpoints. Remarkably many recommended clinical protocols for VNS therapy appear to violate
 6 strong preclinical evidence as well as approved therapies that rely on vagal afferent activation of central nervous
 7 mechanisms. Low intensities of clinically tolerated VNS activate myelinated vagal afferents and these activate
 8 neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Preclinical data on vagal NTS neurons outline multiple
 9 mechanisms controlling successful vagal transmission but indicate that current clinical VNS protocols likely
10 engage substantial frequency dependent transmission depression within NTS. Our global hypothesis is that VNS
11 drives central nervous system (CNS) pathways that contribute to beneficial therapeutic outcomes. Our goals are
12 to identify the mechanistic basis for processes contributing to optimal VNS therapy. Activation of the CNS by
13 VNS requires successful activation of action potentials in NTS neurons. We found that midcollicular knife cuts
14 eliminate pathways above the medulla and profoundly reduced VNS activation of NTS neurons. Our work will
15 examine the contribution of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Our experimental design
16 assays cellular mechanisms of NTS activation in brain slices as well as single NTS neurons in intact animals.
17 Hypotheses related to PVN will center on potential mechanisms of NTS modulation including roles for the
18 neuropeptides, vasopressin and oxytocin. New optogenetic experiments will incorporate transfections of PVN
19 neurons that are activated by VNS to expression ChR2 or halorhodopsin to control these neurons via light. Our
20 Aims focus on weak-intensity, vagal afferent activation of the CNS. Our approach relies on our direct assays of
21 NTS neuron activation – both in the intact brain as well as brain slice, intracellular recordings of NTS in vitro. We
22 propose Specific Aims supported by Preliminary Results that will identify the mechanisms for amplification and
23 spread of VNS excitation. Aim 1 focuses on potential mechanisms within NTS with emphasis on vagal timing
24 and synaptic depression while Aim 2 assesses mechanisms related to PVN modulation of NTS neurons with a
25 particular focus on oxytocin and vasopressin. Aim 3 assesses vagal afferent transmission in heart failure animals.
26 Aim 4 evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of VNS to relieve heart failure in a rat model. This proposal embraces
27 an assessment of whether optimizing activation of NTS neurons will enhance VNS efficacy in a heart failure
28 model. This work addresses a fundamental knowledge gap of neuromodulation therapy. Greater knowledge of
29 visceral afferent processing should drive new stimulation approaches in all clinical applications. We aim to
30 provide a knowledge foundation necessary for deliberate, evidence-based criteria for VNS therapy to improve
31 clinical outcomes."
10882327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance. Better understanding is required of innate mechanisms and new cell therapies that enhance
host resilience against acute lung injury (ALI), and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Based on our prior findings, our premise is that gap junctional channels (GJCs) between myeloid cells and the
alveolar epithelium (AE) determine host resilience to ALI. Hence, we will first, evaluate the extent to which
increasing alveolar GJCs between airway-instilled bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) and the AE
enhances host resilience. Second, we will evaluate the role of GJC-communicated Ca2+ waves, leading to
activation of calmodulin kinase kinase-2 (CAMKK2) in the AE, as mechanisms underlying host resilience.
Approach. We will study mouse models of ALI, induced by intranasal instillation of LPS (lipopolysaccharide),
or of the Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), an opportunistic pathogen that causes
ARDS. We will evaluate the premise by means of real-time confocal microscopy (RCM) of live mouse lungs, as
well as other general approaches. In SA1, we will determine the timing of alveolar GJC formation after BMDM
instillation, the extent to which the BMDMs convert to AMs, and the impact on ALI as quantified by our
reported assays. In SA2, we will quantify real-time Ca2+ responses, CAMKK2 activation and the role the
kinase’s target, AMP kinase (AMPK). The studies will involve genetically modified mice, and human lung
slices, and consideration of rigor, sex and human relevance.
Impact. Our studies will for the first time, reveal the importance of enhancing GJCs between alveolar myeloid
cells and the AE as a means to bolstering host resilience to ALI. Application of instilled BMDMs will be
understood as novel cell therapy for ALI/ARDS. Outstandingly novel mechanistic understanding will be
achieved regarding the pathobiology of host resilience against ALI."
10873977,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacteria in the orders Bacillales and Clostridiales cause over a million infections each year and are responsible
for huge monetary losses to the food industry. These bacteria can resist antibiotics and sterilization by entering
a highly durable spore state. Spores are metabolically inactive and can remain dormant for decades, yet upon
exposure to nutrients they rapidly resume vegetative growth and cause food spoilage, food-borne illness, or
life-threatening disease. The exit from dormancy, germination, is a key target in addressing these diseases.
The germination program of most spore-forming bacteria involves a common series of chemical steps and a
small set of highly conserved factors. GerA-family receptors embedded in the spore membrane are required for
nutrient sensing. The presence of germinants triggers the release of monovalent cations from the spore core,
which is rapidly followed by the expulsion of large stores of dipicolinic acid (DPA) likely mediated by a putative
transporter complex encoded by the spoVA (5A) operon. This activates cell wall hydrolases that degrade the
specialized spore cortex peptidoglycan, allowing rehydration of the spore core, macromolecular synthesis, and
resumption of growth. The mechanisms behind each of these steps are almost entirely unknown.
We seek to define the germination signal transduction pathway in molecular terms, taking an integrative
approach that combines genetic, biochemical, computational, and structural methods. The aims are:
(1) Elucidate the mechanisms of nutrient detection and signal transduction. We will determine how GerA-
family receptors detect amino acids, sugars, and inorganic cations to trigger germination. We will test the
hypothesis that the germination receptors oligomerize forming a membrane pore that functions as a ligand-
gated ion channel that releases monovalent cations in response to nutrients.
(2) Determine the mechanism of DPA release from the spore core. We will investigate the model that two
subunits encoded by the 5A locus form a membrane channel and a third component functions a cytosolic plug
that keeps the channel closed. We will test the model that this complex transports DPA and is activated by
cation release.
If successful, the proposed work will provide molecular-level insight into how spores detect nutrients, trigger ion
release, and activate export of DPA, providing the mechanistic and structural framework needed for discovery
and optimization of small molecule modulators of the germination pathway. Our work will enable the development
of treatments that either inappropriately induce germination, leaving cells vulnerable to standard antibacterial
therapies, or block it, directly preventing disease."

A key to the success of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and
Pancreatic Cancer (Consortium) lies in effective communication and collaboration among
scientists in multiple disciplines; strong study design for discovery and validation of biomarkers
characterizing complex interactions between chronic pancreatitis (CP), diabetes mellitus (DM),
and pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and evaluation of novel intervention strategies; robust and high-
quality data and specimen collection; and rigorous study execution of Consortium collaborative
protocols. In the last four and a half years, the Coordination and Data Management Center
(CDMC) has provided strong scientific, administrative, regulatory, managerial, logistic, and
analytic supports to the Consortium, enabling the successful launch of three longitudinal cohort
studies (i.e., PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, and NOD) that aim to understand the relationship
between CP, DM, and PDAC; and two other studies (i.e., DETECT and DEPICT (in planning))
that aim to better define and characterize Type 3c diabetes (T3cDM). In the next five years, the
overall CDMC aim is to further refine and optimize the center's time-tested infrastructure,
operations procedures, and organizational structure to provide strong and continual
supports to the Consortium's existing and new studies, and address any emerging
challenges associated with the progress of the studies from the accrual phase to the follow-
up and dissemination phases. Specifically, we aim to (i) provide operation and coordination
of the Consortium; (ii) provide supports to continue the accrual and follow up of patients in
Consortium-approved studies; (iii) provide the infrastructure for biomarker development,
prevention studies, and therapeutic trials; and (iv) design and support new studies and disease
prevention."

The primary objective of this proposal is to enhance the molecular diagnosis rate and deepen our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms underlying Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). RP, the most prevalent form of retinal
degeneration, affects 1 in 3,000 people worldwide. The genetics and pathways responsible for the disease are
highly heterogeneous. Currently, approximately 25% of cases remain unexplained upon molecular mutation
screen, representing one of the most significant gaps in our current knowledge of the disease. To address this
challenge, we propose to systematically identify novel mutant alleles and genes that are overlooked by the
current screening process through a combination of whole-genome sequencing and functional validation
experiments. To achieve this goal, during our last funding period, we established a large collection of over 450
well-characterized RP patient families whose pathogenic mutations remain unassigned after screening for coding
mutations in known retinal disease genes. Patients from these families are likely affected by mutations missed
by current technologies, representing a well-characterized, valuable resource for identifying new mutations and
disease-associated genes. During last funding period, whole exome sequencing has been performed for all
unsolved probands, including 200 with whole-genome sequencing. Building on this work, our Specific Aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Characterize the novel RP associated disease gene DDX41
Specific Aim 2. Unravel the full spectrum of mutations in unsolved RP patients
Specific Aim 3. Identify and characterize novel RP disease genes
 Progress toward these goals is likely to identify multiple novel RP genes whose subsequent study will lead
to new insights into disease mechanisms as well as lay the foundation for developing new diagnoses and
treatment methods, including gene therapy. Importantly, the protocols and software tools developed from these
aims, particularly noncoding mutation identification, will be applicable to other human diseases as well."

The Early Phase Clinical Cancer Prevention Consortium proposes to develop, implement, and complete early
clinical trials targeting cellular stemness. Most cancers display a hierarchical organization that is driven by a
population of cells that are “stem-like”. Inflammatory stress drives increased stem cell self-renewal across
different organ sites. The sources of chronic inflammatory stess include obesity, explosures (alcohol, chemicals),
infectious agents, microbial dysbiosis, and genetic polymorphisms. Of these, the obesity-associated metabolic
syndrome associated is reaching epidemic proportions. This consortium addresses the overarching hypothesis
that inflammatory-induced shifts in the tissue stromal environment increase stem cell self-renewal and enhance
epithelial mesenchymal transformation. These shifts can be reversed or dampened by biomarker driven dosing
of clinical preventive agents, either alone or in combination. We select agents that target the adverse metabolic
milieu resulting from inflammatory exposures and driving stem cell proliferation. The Consortium proposes the
following aims: 1. To develop and submit at least three proposals each year for early phase trials for the
prevention of obesity-related cancers (colon, lower esophagus, breast, prostate, bladder); 2. To conduct 1 to 3
early phase cancer prevention trials per year within the fiscal capacity of the grant that include evaluating
translational endpoints in biospecimens, asssessing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and
obtaining mechanistic proof-of-principle data; and 3. To manage all aspects of study operations while complying
with all applicable rules and regulations for the conduct of clinical trials. The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer
Center is the lead organization of a consortium consisting of 9 institutions of which all are within NCI Core Funded
Cancer Centers. The intellectual diversity and strong academic accomplishement of our consortium permits
deep intellectual engagement combined with the experienced logistics of participant recruitment and retention,
and the infrastructure support available in NCI supported cancer centers. We have established processes to
ensure rapid turn-around of letters of intent and protocol documents, uniform sample handling, management and
shipment, and rapid analysis of biosamples. The Consortium will collaborate with other the CP-CTNet consortia
to create synergies of science and resources, enabling paradigm shifts that rapidly test and prioritize agents for
Phase III trials conducted in individuals at increased risk of cancer."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to uncover novel HUMAN-SPECIFIC molecular mechanisms by which
human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HL6 facilitates lipid droplet (LD) transport in human cardiomyocytes (CMs)
and manifests a cardioprotective role against metabolic syndrome associated cardiomyopathy. ~70% energy of
adult human heart is obtained from oxidation of long chain fatty acids (FAs). Balanced lipid metabolism is crucial
for heart function. Compromised lipid metabolism have been widely observed in cardiomyopathies associated
with metabolic syndromes, such as obesity and diabetes. The distinct features of obese and diabetes associated
cardiomyopathy are increased incidence of heart failure together with extensive intramyocyte lipid droplet
accumulation. LD consists of a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, which plays a critical
role in excess fatty acid storage and mobilization. However, overwhelmed intramyocyte LDs can cause cardiac
lipotoxicity and dysfunction in both human patients and rodent models of obesity and diabetes. Although ample
evidence suggests that LD accumulation in CMs could be due to impaired LD transport, the cellular system for
LD transport in mammalian heart remains elusive. Particularly, the human-specific LD transport system of CMs
and its implication in metabolic syndrome associated cardiomyopathy and heart failure remain unknown.
Recently, we identified a human lncRNA, Heart LncRNA 6 (HL6), which is highly and specifically expressed in
human CMs and downregulated in human type 2 diabetic myocardium. HL6 was knocked out (HL6KO) in
human iPSCs (hiPSCs) by using CRISPR/Cas-9. We found HL6 deficiency led to extensive LD
accumulation, defective LD transport to mitochondria, swollen mitochondria with impaired function, and
enhanced CM death in HL6KO hiPSC-CMs verse WT hiPSC-CMs. Intriguingly, HL6 binds LDs and
cytoskeleton in hiPSC-CMs. Additionally, transgenic HL6 overexpression significantly mitigated high fat diet
(HFD)-induced lipid accumulation and cardiac dysfunction of mouse heart. Therefore, we hypothesize that HL6
plays an indispensable role in LD transport to mitochondria in human CMs, and gain-of-HL6 manifests a
cardioprotective role against metabolic syndrome associated cardiomyopathy. Two specific aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: Decipher the indispensable role of HL6 in lipid droplet transport of human CMs. Specific Aim 2:
Determine the cardioprotective role of HL6 in metabolic syndrome associated cardiomyopathy."

We address calls for research that will inform paradigm-shifting interventions to address sexual
harassment and racialized mistreatment of advanced trainees in biomedical research training
environments (NOT-OD-21-150). Our approach is grounded in power-approach and moral
licensing theories which examines how personal embodiment of power in the context of structural
inequities mobilizes harassing and racist mistreatment of trainees. We conduct rigorous
experience sampling research to capture the effects of research mentors’ daily power
embodiment on mentees’ experiences of sexual harassment and related mistreatments to better
understand these linkages and exacerbating factors. We further develop a comprehensive
intervention, Indiana CARES (Creating Accountability and Building Relationships to Eradicate
Sexual Harassment), designed to break the links between power and harassment and change
the training environment climate and practices so that mentees can thrive. For Aim 1, 320 pairs
of mentor-mentees in biomedical research training programs will be solicited to participate in a
10-day daily survey study. Mentors will complete daily measures of their power embodiment,
affective states, and moral licensing cognitions. Mentees will complete evening measures of their
experiences of mistreatment by their mentors. Qualitative data on the nature of any mistreatment
they experience will be solicited. We further examine whether racial minority mentees are
particularly vulnerable to experiencing racialized sexual harassment, microaggression and
ostracism and we explore how structural characteristics, such as the relational demography
(race/gender matching) of mentor-mentee dyads, as well as the program’s tolerance for
harassment and mistreatment, as reported by mentees, affects these linkages. For Aim 2,
biomedical, research-active faculty at IUPUI and IUSM will be randomly assigned to a treatment
or control cohort. Our intervention consists of a four-part training program focusing on addressing
the role of power and moral licensing through perspective-taking and empathy training, followed
by a program-centered organizational change initiative supported by Program Enhancement
Grants (PEGs). Research will examine the impact of the training on breaking the power-
harassment link for mentors and improving their sensitivity to harassment and racial mistreatment.
Furthermore, our research will examine the impact of the full Indiana CARES intervention on
improving the climate for sexual harassment intolerance, and increasing mentees’ sense of
belongingness and early career outcomes through reductions in harassment and racist
mistreatment. We replicate this program for the control cohort in the final year."

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder affecting 1 in 5000
people in the US, is a devastating lifelong condition with no FDA-approved treatments. Accordingly, there is an
urgent need for efficacious systemic therapies in HHT to reduce bleeding and improve health-related quality of
life (HRQOL). Patients with HHT develop fragile telangiectasias along the gut and nasal mucosa secondary to
elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This leads to recurrent severe epistaxis and chronic
gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in iron deficiency anemia (and dependence on blood transfusions and/or iron
infusions) and severely diminished HRQOL. We and others have previously successfully used systemic
bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, as an off-label agent to treat chronic bleeding in HHT,
documenting in multicenter observational studies a 70-80% reduction in red cell transfusions and iron infusions,
a 3-4 g/dL mean hemoglobin rise, and 50% reduction in epistaxis severity compared to before bevacizumab
treatment. However, this observational work is limited in generalizability given heterogeneity in patients, variable
drug dosing, and non-standardized thresholds for administration of red cells and iron. Furthermore, the impact
of bevacizumab on HRQOL and the angiogenic milieu is unknown. Therefore, we will perform a phase II clinical
trial of systemic bevacizumab in adults with HHT dependent on iron infusions and/or blood transfusions to
determine the impact of bevacizumab on bleeding and HRQOL. The primary endpoint will be a composite
measurement of red cell transfusions and iron infusions, the Hematologic Support Score (HSS). We will evaluate
the impact of bevacizumab on HRQOL in HHT as a secondary endpoint utilizing PROMIS instruments and a
novel HHT-specific QOL tool. Finally, we will evaluate the effect of bevacizumab on angiogenic biomarkers in
HHT, to better understand how it impacts the HHT angiogenic milieu. Our central hypothesis is that systemic
bevacizumab significantly reduces chronic bleeding in HHT as measured by reductions in the HSS and
improvements in hemoglobin and HRQOL. Success would pave the way for a larger definitive trial and establish
a blueprint for conducting future studies repurposing other antiangiogenics for HHT.
The applicant, Dr. Hanny Al-Samkari, is well-qualified to execute this research and is committed to becoming an
independent hemostasis clinical investigator with a focus on drug repurposing and biomarker research in HHT.
He will be mentored by Dr. David Kuter, with Dr. Neil Zakai, Dr. Karla Ballman and Dr. Dan Duda serving as co-
mentors. Each mentor contributes unique expertise necessary for his transition to an independent HHT NIH
physician scientist. To achieve his goals, he has proposed a comprehensive five-year career development plan
of rigorous coursework that synergizes with the research plan aims. The MGH Division of Hematology Oncology
is internationally-recognized for its tradition of clinical trial excellence, scientific discovery and mentorship, so is
an ideal environment for completion of these scientific and career development objectives."
10885906,"Exercise is frequently recommended to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture. However, bone does not
always result in the expected improvements in bone mass, and there is evidence that endurance exercise may
lead to bone loss under certain conditions. It is our contention that disruptions in calcium homeostasis during
exercise, resulting in a decrease in serum ionized calcium (iCa) and increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH)
and c-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX; a marker of bone resorption) that occur shortly after the start of
exercise, may be responsible for the lack of the expected improvements in bone mineral density. The iCa,
PTH, and CTX responses to exercise have been well-characterized for both young and older adults in
response to a single endurance exercise bout, but it is unclear if resistance training (e.g., weightlifting) results
in the same exercise-induced disruption in calcium homeostasis. Further, it is unclear how the iCa, PTH, and
CTX response to exercise may change with exercise training, and if a bone anabolic response to exercise can
be detected after repeat exercise bouts. The bone anabolic response to exercise (assessed by procollagen of
type I terminal propeptide, P1NP; a marker of bone formation) has yet to be fully characterized, but that may
be due to the testing of single exercise bouts and the short sampling timeline following exercise. To address
these gaps in knowledge, up to 60 Veterans (30 men, 30 women), aged 60-80 years, will be randomized to 1)
stationary cycling; or 2) resistance training and will complete 10 weeks of supervised exercise training 3x/week
(30 total exercise training sessions). This number of exercise visits was due to the demonstrated increase in
P1NP after 28 doses of teriparatide, a PTH analog, that results in bone formation. During the 1st, 15th, and 30th
exercise training session, participants will undergo an acute exercise testing bout with pre- and post-exercise
sampling up to 48 hours after exercise. Blood samples will be collected to measure iCa, PTH, CTX and P1NP.
The primary aims are 1) to determine if resistance exercise results in a different bone biomarker response
compared to what we have observed during endurance exercise in older adults; 2) determine if resistance
and/or endurance exercise result in an increase in P1NP over 10 weeks of exercise training. Exploratory
outcomes related to changes in fitness and functional status will address how Veteran health is impacted by
each exercise type, which will be used to inform future applications. The biomarker and functional outcomes
information are the next step in determining the appropriate “dose” of exercise, consisting of factors such as
exercise type, frequency, duration, and intensity (which will be explored in future research), can be used to
enhance Veteran health. Exercise should continue to be recommended for overall health, but future
interventions could incorporate what is known about the dose of exercise that is needed for cardiometabolic
health and the emerging data on the dose of exercise needed to preserve bone health to create personalized
exercise prescriptions to improve multiple components of Veteran health. The proposed research is significant
because it is investigating several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to design future, larger exercise
and lifestyle interventions aimed at preserving multiple components of Veteran health, which could have a
lasting impact on Veteran quality of life and functional independence. The proposed research is innovative
because it is testing novel hypotheses, the mode of exercise on the disruption in calcium homeostasis and the
role of exercise training, in a population that could greatly benefit from the knowledge to be gained. Long-term,
information gleaned from this research will help to define personalized exercise prescriptions to improve
cardiometabolic health without compromising bone health in aging Veterans."

 The Sjögren’s International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established in 2003 to improve the
understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) by 1) developing/validating
standardized classification criteria for SS; and 2) developing a longitudinal data and biospecimen repository that
could be used by the research community for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS. Using
rigorous study design and, standardized data/specimen collection protocols, SICCA investigators from nine
leading academic research groups across the globe assembled a unique biorepository from a cohort of 3,514
participants with extremely well characterized phenotypic data (with follow-up data/specimens on 771). Multiple
deliverables were achieved including 1) development and validation of classification criteria for SS provisionally
approved by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2011 (followed by the development/validation of a
set of classification criteria approved by ACR and EULAR in 2016); 2) a Genome-Wide Association Study that
highlighted the genetic heterogeneity of SS according to ancestry, and established a unique genetic repository for
SS available for public use through dbGAP; and 3) a dissemination plan, which has yielded important new findings
regarding the SS phenotype. In response to FOA PAR-17-154, our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded
resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and an expanded team, and positions us to exploit recent explosive
growth in the fields of immunology, genomics and epigenetics to better understand the pathogenesis of SS and
identify therapeutic pathways, and new biomarkers. Using previously collected clinical data/biospecimens, and
genome-wide genotyping performed on all participants, we propose to define the transcriptomics and epigenetics
of SS at the cell and tissue levels. This will enhance the SICCA registry by generating genome-wide DNA
methylation and whole-genome sequencing of single-cell mRNA, bulk mRNA, and miRNA and enable high impact
studies of underlying biologic pathways of SS. Given the relationship between the epigenome and gene
expression, specific epigenetic modifications and transcriptomic profiles may represent novel biomarkers in
autoimmune diseases. We also propose an expanded dissemination plan that can leverage these omics data sets
thereby engaging SS investigators worldwide in discovery. We aim to 1) Generate transcriptome and methylation
profiles in order to explore transcriptomic diversity across subsets of SICCA participants with well characterized
epigenetic and genetic profiles, across cell and tissue types; 2) Explore correlations between omics profiles and
signs of severe disease manifestations, including presence of germinal-center-formation (GCF) and focal
lymphocytic sialadenitis with a high focus score in LSG biopsies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and
hypocomplementemia; and 3) Characterize longitudinal changes in omics profiles of subsets of SICCA patients.
While traditional phenotypic features of SS are stable, we hypothesize that omics profiles may be more dynamic
across time, providing insight into biologic processes associated with disease progression and outcome."

Macrophages are a class of immune cells important in the prognosis and treatment of several diseases,
including cancer. CD68 is the established clinical biomarker for pan-macrophage. Currently, there are no non-
invasive probes specific for human or mouse CD68. We propose to develop novel probes for human and
mouse CD68 for PET imaging of macrophages. This project involves phage display screening of a human Fab
library (Aim 1a); binding of resulting “hits” to CD68 proteins (Aim 1b) validating in CD68-positive macrophages
to select lead huFabs (Aim 1c); and evaluating the function of the resulting lead radiolabeled huFabs in
appropriate mice models (Aim 2). From this work, we will produce a PET imaging toolkit for imaging human
and mouse macrophages with high binding affinity, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for
same-day imaging. Our long-term goal is to apply our novel PET probes to quantify macrophage density in vivo
in different diseases in humans and mice. Specifically, we envision that co-clinical trials will employ these
probes for imaging human subjects and corresponding mice models of disease to monitor response to
treatments that modulate macrophage activity."

Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα is believed to be responsible for the delayed fracture healing observed in diabetes. However, there is no consensus on the effect of TNFα inhibition on the bone formation, indicating the unmet need in searching for new regents with unique features other than pure TNF inhibitors for diabetic fracture healing. Our genetic screen led to the identification of TNFR as the novel receptor of progranulin (PGRN) (Tang, et al, Science, 2011), a chondrogenic factor that has been shown to be therapeutic against autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. Type 1 diabetes is the most common autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic inflammation and elevated TNFα activity. Although TNFα activity is mediated primarily through TNFR1, we were excited to find that PGRN-stimulated bone regeneration largely depends on TNFR2. These paradoxical findings suggest that the regenerative PGRN/TNFR2 pathway plays a major role in PGRN-stimulated fracture healing. In addition, 14-3-3ε was identified as a component of TNFR2 pathway in response to PGRN stimulation. Further, we have developed an engineered protein named Atsttrin which is composed of three TNFR-binding domains of PGRN, and Atsttrin is more effective than PGRN in inflammatory arthritis. Given that elevated TNFα is believed to be responsible for delayed diabetic fracture healing, we hypothesize that PGRN and Atsttrin stimulate diabetic fracture healing through a) inhibition of TNFα/TNFR1 inflammatory and bone resorption pathway; and primarily b) recruitment of 14-3-3ε to TNFR2, followed by activation of bone regeneration pathway. The Specific Aims are: (1) To determine the role of PGRN, especially its derivative Atsttrin, in diabetic fracture healing. We will use both systemic and inducible PGRN knockout mice to determine whether knockout of PGRN delays diabetic fracture healing, and whether recombinant PGRN and Atsttrin can reverse it (SA#1A); which stage of fracture healing requires PGRN for successful completion of diabetic fracture healing (SA#1B); and whether PGRN, especially Atsttrin, has therapeutic efficacy in treating diabetic fracture (SA#1C). We will use an appropriate injectable hydrogel to locally deliver various dosages of PGRN or Atsttrin. (2) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PGRN and Atsttrin stimulate diabetic fracture healing. We will determine the effects of PGRN, Atsttrin, and TNFα on chondrogenesis of diabetic bone marrow stem cells, signaling pathways, interplays and dependence on TNFR and 14-3-3ε (SA#2A); whether both TNFRs are important for mediating PGRN's role in diabetic bone healing (SA#2B); and whether the protective effects of PGRN and Atsttrin depend on 14-3-3ε by establishing diabetic fracture models with inducible 14-3-3ε[-/-] mice (SA#2C). Proposed studies will not only advance our understanding of the molecular events underlying diabetic fracture healing, but could also lead to novel therapeutic interventions for diabetic fracture healing and other conditions in which fracture healing is impaired."

Maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) continue to rise in the United States, and women from
low-income communities, minoritized racial/ethnic groups, and those with Medicaid or who are uninsured face
increased risk. Hospital care at the time of delivery, and prenatal care during pregnancy, both occur late in the
progression of conditions that are important to maternal outcomes. Therefore, expanding access to
preconception care is a promising approach to improving maternal health and outcomes. Evidence-based
preconception interventions include counseling patients on healthy behaviors (e.g. taking folic acid), managing
chronic health conditions, and providing contraceptive care to plan timing of pregnancy. For many low-income
women, a major barrier to receiving preconception care has been lack of health insurance coverage. The
Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the uninsured rate among reproductive age women, giving women greater
access to preconception care. Some states began implementing the ACA’s Medicaid coverage expansion in
2014, and women’s report of receiving counseling on preconception health increased significantly in Medicaid
expansion states compared to non-expansion states. Prior research has identified an association between
preconception care and decreased risk of SMM, particularly among women with a chronic disease. However,
further research is needed to establish a causal effect. This study will harness the study team’s access to
nationwide Medicaid claims data and leverage Medicaid expansion as a natural experiment to estimate the
causal effect of preconception care on SMM for women insured by Medicaid. Analyzing existing Medicaid
claims data will allow us to describe change in preconception care and SMM rates in expansion and non-
expansion states (Aim 1). We will then use quasi-experimental design enabled by variation in state policy (i.e.
timing of adopting Medicaid expansion) to estimate the causal effect of preconception care on risk of SMM,
both in the Medicaid population overall and in sub-groups at highest risk based on medical history (e.g. chronic
disease or history of prior SMM) or sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 2). We will also gain the nuanced
perspectives of patients at high risk for SMM and clinicians who care for them, using qualitative focus groups
and key informant interviews (Aim 3). By combining quantitative Medicaid claims and qualitative analyses, we
will identify preconception interventions and approaches with high likelihood of reducing SMM, particularly for
women at highest risk. We will translate these findings to develop a novel preconception care model that will
be tested in future work."

Predictive personalized healthcare and precision medicine enable a new era of medicine, in which traditional
physiological information and new clinical data including genetic data, imaging data, and healthcare data come
together to match the right patient with the right treatment at the right time. With healthcare and clinical
technology rapidly grow, the vast and varied amounts of clinical data become widely accessible and usable.
However, current modeling techniques lack of combining pathophysiology with imaging data. Therefore,
developing an innovative data analytical tool that combines personalized clinical data with the existing sciences
of epidemiology and clinical medicine becomes an urgent need in this new area. The overall vision of this
research project is to develop a pathophysiology driven spatial dynamic modeling (PDSDM) approach for
personalized healthcare prediction and precision medicine. Our five-year goals are to develop the PDSDM
computational modeling platform and validate this platform on patient data for various diseases. In specific, we
will develop an interactive computational platform to build the PDSDM model and develop a computational
module to simulate the model automatically. Then we will develop a model calibration module by employing the
clinical patient data to parameterize mathematical models arising from physiological signaling pathway
networks and will also incorporate the imaging data as the spatial computational domain; moreover, optimal
personalized treatment studies will be performed on this computational modeling platform for current available
clinical trials. This innovative framework will integrate mathematical modeling, computational methods, data
analysis, and data-driven optimization techniques to provide a personalized spatial computational model for
each individual. We will validate this new framework on various biomedical diseases such as cardiovascular
disease, chronic pancreatitis, and Alzheimer’s disease with existing clinical and biological data. The proposed
research is significant because it will provide the 3D prediction for personalized disease progression which
would evaluate personalized disease risk more accurately. It will also provide a systematic way to assess the
available treatment plans virtually then to provide an optimal treatment suggestion for each individual."

 Music training has long been used as a treatment to enhance neural function and behavioral outcomes
in clinical populations. There is an extensive literature describing how music-training and tonal language
learning alters the brain and behavior in healthy adult populations. One important unresolved issue is how
music experience and language experience interact in the developing brain.
 Understanding how and to what extent music and language experience modulate cortical dynamics for
brain functions (e.g., music and speech processing) will open a crucial door to treat a myriad of neurological
conditions with an auditory or language base. The long-term overarching goal of this project is to uncover the
causal relationship between brain networks and behavioral aspects of music sensitivity in the developing brain.
This first project proposes to apply a combination of a music neurophysiological paradigm, a lexical tone
neurophysiological paradigm and behavioral measures to uncover the complex interaction between music and
lexical tone processing in the developing brain.
 The three specific aims are: 1) To determine the cortical maturational trajectories of auditory processing
in terms of six main music features (rhythm, intensity, location, slide, pitch, and timbre) in 5-10 year old
children. Event-related potential (ERP) responses will be compared across age groups. A multi-feature music
oddball paradigm that includes six types of feature changes will be used. Significance: This aim is essential
for examining brain developmental plasticity for the processing of different music features. 2) To determine
whether early music training, tonal language, bilingual language experience and different English dialects
modulate cortical sensitivity to the above-mentioned six main music features. The ERP responses will be
compared across monolingual-bilingual, tonal-nontonal language, mainstream American English dialect –
African American English dialect groups (monolingual English with mainstream American English dialect with
and without music training, monolingual English with African American English dialect, bilingual Spanish-
English and bilingual Mandarin-English). Significance: These comparisons are important because it will, for
the first time, reveal the intricate relationship between dialectal experience, lexical tone development, bilingual
development and brain development for music processing at the cortical level. 3) To determine whether, and to
what extent, early music experience and language experience modulate cortical sensitivity to lexical tone
processing. The ERP responses to lexical tone contrast will be compared across the above-mentioned groups
of children. Significance: These comparisons are important because it will shed light on the relationship
between early music training and the neural representations for speech processing."
10887597,"Maternal obesity, AMPK and Developmental Programming
 Over 30% of pregnant American women are obese and an additional 30% are over-weight, conditions which
negatively affect fetal development with long-term consequences for offspring health, including pre-disposition
to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Skeletal muscle (SM)
accounts for >30% body weight and is a key tissue for the oxidation of fatty acids and glucose, as is brown
adipose tissue (BAT). Under the support of our previous award, we demonstrated that maternal obesity (MO)
elicits early onset of fibrotic and fatty infiltration (FFI) in offspring SM and BAT, which impairs their functions
and programs metabolic disorders in offspring. We found that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a known
target for metformin, is robustly inhibited due to MO, correlates with FFI and worsened offspring SM/BAT
functions. In the early embryo, both myogenic and fibrogenic cells are derived from progenitor cells (PCs) in
the dermomyotome. While the embryonic myogenic cells are the sources of both myogenic and brown
adipogenic cells, embryonic fibrogenic cells are sources of fibrogenic and white adipogenic cells in offspring
SM/BAT. Because of this, our previous studies point to embryonic origins for developmental abnormalities of
offspring SM/BAT due to MO, but this is yet to be examined. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq),
we found that embryonic myogenesis is attenuated in E9.5 MO embryos. We hypothesize that MO suppresses
AMPK, which inhibits myogenic commitment and drives uncommitted PCs to fibrogenesis during embryonic
development, programming FFI in offspring SM/BAT. Accordingly, we have three specific aims: 1) Study AMPK
inhibition due to MO in impairing embryonic myogenic commitment; 2) Evaluate AMPK in linking MO to
enhanced embryonic fibrogenesis; and 3) Analyze AMPK as a target for improving embryonic SM/BAT
development of MO and the resulting offspring SM/BAT functions. We will use single cell “omics” for analyzing
embryonic tissues, and embryoid body culture for mechanistic exploration. Knowledge obtained will identify
molecular targets for therapeutics to improve embryonic SM/BAT development and subsequent metabolic
health of MO offspring, helping the increasing populations of obese mothers to deliver healthy children."
10887599,"We are requesting continued funding of our T32 training grant DK007647 “Graduate Training in Nutrition” to
support our predoctoral program in Nutritional and Metabolic Biology. The overall goal of our program is to
train individuals to become leading investigators in the field of nutritional sciences who will contribute
substantially to modern biomedical research. The program is housed in the Institute of Human Nutrition at
Columbia University Irving Medical Center. It is directed by Dr. Debra J. Wolgemuth (PI) and Co-Directors
(Co-PIs) Drs. Anthony W. Ferrante and Lori M. Zeltser. This training program is broadly focused on the
nutritional and metabolic sciences. The required didactic training consists of graduate level basic science and
nutrition courses, and all PhD students participate in the Doctoral Seminar and Reviews in Nutrition course
throughout their residence in the training program. All the training faculty have laboratory-based basic science
research programs focused on nutrients or nutrition-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, or
cardiometabolic disease. Although training focused on basic nutritional research, the program also provides a
broad education in clinical and public health nutrition.
The program consists of a highly structured didactic component and a mentored research component. Support
from this grant was the key ingredient that allowed this training program in nutrition to grow from 6 PhD
students and 11 faculty in 1989 to its present steady-state size of ~30 PhD students and 38 faculty. For the
previous grant period, we received support for 6 Ph.D. students per year. Because of the growth and
achievements of our training program, we are requesting continued support for 6 PhD students per year in this
renewal application.
The initial stages of the program provide comprehensive, structured training in modern biomedical research
with a focus on nutrition and nutrition-related questions. Next, trainees are provided with rigorous mentored
research training. This research training takes place in the research groups of one of the productive and well-
funded independent scientists who comprise the training faculty. The data and narrative provided within this
application demonstrate that we are very successfully training individuals committed to careers in research,
teaching, and related professions with the fundamental knowledge, skills, and experience that are needed for
developing successful, independent nutritional sciences research careers in the 21st Century."
10884250,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive disease, often leading to loss of exocrine and endocrine
function and debilitating abdominal pain. It is unknown why some individuals progress and
develop complications, including pancreatogenic diabetes (T3cDM) and/or pancreas cancer
(PDAC). In this Consortium, investigators have proposed and initiated several well-powered
studies of risk factors, environmental influences, and proof-of-concept studies to move the field
forward, particularly those factors that increase the risk of T3cDM and PDAC. Many of these
studies are ongoing, while new innovative proposals will address other research objectives
identified by the participating NIH institutes. We propose several specific aims (SA) to meet the
goals of RFA-DK-19-009. In SA #1, we propose to continue the CPDPC's three main longitudinal
studies: PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2 and NOD, as well as those two studies designed to better define
and characterize T3cDM, DETECT and DEPICT. In SA #2, we propose to continue the ancillary
study begun during the first funding cycle, specifically MINIMAP. SA #3: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a
carbohydrate-binding protein which appears to be involved in fibrogenesis and tissue remodeling
in CP. A Gal-3 inhibitor is safe and shows potential for reducing hepatic fibrosis in non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis. We propose to test the hypothesis that a Gal-3 inhibitor is safe and efficacious in
patients with CP, and may reverse or halt the fibrosis observed in CP. We will evaluate changes
in pancreatic fibrosis as assessed by MRI, as well as serum and pancreatic fluid exploratory
biomarkers. In SA #4, we propose innovative studies evaluating different strategies and
interventions focused on alleviating abdominal pain in CP patients. Lacosamide, an anti-epileptic
drug, appears to inhibit opioid-induced hyperalgesia. In SA #4a, we will perform a dose-escalation
trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding lacosamide to opioid therapy, followed by a
pilot randomized trial to obtain preliminary data regarding change in pain control, opioid use and
quality of life after adding lacosamide to an opioid. SA #4b: Quantitative sensory testing (QST)
uses electrical and pressure stimulation at different dermatomes in order to unravel the pain
system. We will investigate: (i) the association between QST profiles and demographic and
clinical characteristics in patients with suspected or definite CP; (ii) whether the QST profile can
be used to predict the clinical outcome of endoscopic or surgical treatment. SA #4c: Pancreatic
duct stones may complicate CP, contributing to abdominal pain, and removal of these stones at
ERCP frequently leads to significant pain relief. In this proposal, we compare the efficacy of two
adjunctive procedures to ERCP for the treatment of main pancreatic duct stones in painful CP."
10884253,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Almost 30 million tendon injuries are reported annually in the United States, with estimated costs of $114
billion. Even with treatment, some of these tendon injuries become chronic, with pain and loss of function
persisting for more than 3 months. Conservative therapeutic techniques that induce microdamage to promote
healing, such as dry needling (DN) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), produce mixed results
with 0-85% of patients showing improvement. Inconsistencies in parameter reporting, alignment, dosing
protocols, and real-time monitoring contribute to the wide range in patient outcomes.
 We seek to overcome many of the limitations of existing tendinopathy treatments by developing a novel
focused ultrasound (fUS) therapy for tendinopathies with integrated passive cavitation and tissue Doppler
imaging for alignment and quantitative monitoring of the fUS therapy. Recently, we showed that a narrow
range of fUS parameters caused localized collagen fiber separation and fraying in ex vivo rat tendons through
the creation, oscillation, and collapse of cavitation bubbles. When tested in an in vivo rat tendinopathy model,
fUS preserved tendon mechanical properties as well as or better than the traditional DN therapy; the release of
IGF1 and TGFβ healing factors was similar between DN and fUS. However, chronic tendinopathy will influence
the mechanical properties of tendon, which will influence the fUS parameters that result in collagen fiber
disruption. This prompts the need for testing in tendinopathic tendons of similar size to humans and the
development of quantitative passive cavitation and tissue Doppler imaging for real-time monitoring of the
tendon treatment progression.
 Here, we propose to use experiments and modeling to: 1) assess novel fUS to induce ranges of mechanical
fractionation in healthy and tendinopathic ex vivo large animal tendons; 2) integrate PCI and tissue Doppler
imaging for quantitative, real-time assessment of the fUS therapy; and 3) evaluate fUS to treat chronic
tendinopathy. Innovations include a determination of how fUS parameters are affected by the change in
mechanical properties of healthy versus injured tendons and the development of integrated passive cavitation
and tissue Doppler imaging for quantitative analysis of fUS treatment progression. Additional novelty arises
from testing the fUS therapy in a large-animal chronic tendinopathy model and comparing to conventional DN
and ESWT therapies. These experimental results will feed into a large animal biomechanical model for
treatment planning and the development of a framework for personalized treatment planning based on healing,
and cellular and mechanical properties after fUS therapy. Long-term, we will seek translation into humans
based on the in vivo experimental results and the models developed for treatment planning."

 Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Brain edema is the most common life-
threatening complication following an acute stroke event. It leads to elevated intracranial pressure that
will affect the spared areas surrounding the stroked tissue. The preservation of such areas is critical in
reducing brain injury and promoting long-term recovery. Understanding the pathophysiology of brain
edema is key to identifying therapeutic targets and reducing the final disability burden related to acute
stroke. The glymphatic system is a recently discovered waste clearance pathway in the brain. It removes
interstitial metabolic waste products, as well as excessive interstitial fluid (ISF), by facilitating the
exchange of ISF and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). With drastically increased metabolic byproducts and the
development of cerebral edema, the glymphatic system may play a critical role in post-stroke recovery.
Further, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein that has been recognized to be involved in cerebral
edema, also drives the glymphatic system. However, due to the limited means of evaluating the
glymphatic function in vivo, our current understanding of the role of AQP4 and the glymphatic system in
post-stroke recovery is still quite limited.
 The goal of this project is to develop novel MRI methods for quantitative assessment of the
glymphatic function in vivo and to apply these methods to investigate the role of AQP4 and the glymphatic
system in post-stroke edema formation and reabsorption. Specifically, we will develop and validate a 3D
magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method for dynamic and simultaneous tracking of a gadolinium
(Gd)-based, large molecular weight (MW) paravascular tracer (GadoSpin, MW=200 kDa, primarily a T1
contrast agent) and oxygen-17 (17O) enriched water (H217O, MW=19 Da, a T2 contrast agent) in mouse
brain (Aim 1). This approach will enable the simultaneous evaluation of CSF flow in the paravascular
space and CSF-ISF exchange between the paravascular space and brain parenchyma in a single MRF
scan. Kinetic analysis methods will be developed for quantitative assessment of the glymphatic function
from MRF measurements, including the CSF flow in the paravascular conduits and the CSF-ISF
exchange rate and water transport in the glymphatic pathway (Aim 2). These methods will be applied to
evaluate the effects of AQP4 knockout and inhibition on edema formation and reabsorption in two mouse
models of ischemic (cytotoxic edema) and hemorrhagic (vasogenic edema) stroke (Aim 3). Successful
completion of the project will give rise to a novel MRI method for in vivo quantification of glymphatic
function. Application of this method to the investigation of post-stroke pathophysiology will lead to new
insights into the role of AQP4 and the glymphatic system in post-stroke edema."
10884803,"Abstract: The premise of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to advance the science of community
engagement toward increasing African American (AA) and Hispanic communities’ participation in genomic
research. Specifically, the CEC will implement a ‘community-centered’ multi-level and multi-domain participant-
centric strategy to engage AA and Hispanic communities a) in the development of culturally appropriate
interventions for genomic education; b) to promote their recruitment and retention in genomics research; and c)
facilitate the translations and dissemination of study results. Advances in genomics have increased our
understanding of the unique interplay between genetics, environment, behavior, and disease, which has led to
the advancement of clinical-trial matching and precision health (medicine and prevention). However, these
scientific advances are hampered by the inadequate representation of AA and Latinx populations in genomic
research studies; thus, it is paramount to identify effective engagement strategies to increase genomic
knowledge and research participation among AA and Latinx populations. To achieve the specific aims, the CEC
will train an existing cadre of lay community navigators as genomic navigators (GNs) to deliver relevant education
and provide navigation services, to two populations historically underrepresented in genomic research.

10884805,"ABSTRACT: The human reference genome was derived from 20 people, with an individual contributing most
of the genetic information. This linear reference does not represent the structural variation of the human
population. Pan-genome projects have attempted to address this missing variation, but the use of pangenome
references for whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing analysis is not clear, nor is the impact this has on
transcriptome data from different racial/ genetic ancestry populations. Here we will perform a benchmarking
project, whereby we will compare RNA-sequencing mapping statistics from a cohort of RNA-seq data when
mapped/ aligned to various reference genome constructs including Grch38, the Telomere-to-telomere
reference genome (chm13), reference genomes obtained from the human pangenome research project, both
as individual genomes, and as a combined graphical reference, and finally de-novo assembled individual
reference genomes generated by long read sequencing.
 The goal of this project is to understand the tradeoff of individualized references vs. population-based
references with respect to computational burden and mapping accuracy. We will specifically ask whether
populations with European vs. African genetic ancestry benefit from more personalized references. We
hypothesize that reference genomes with related ancestry composition will improve accuracy of RNA-
seq mapping and our estimation of gene function.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: SPECIFIC AIM ONE: Test the utility of
reference genomes by determining the differential metrics of short and long read RNA seq data aligned to the
GRCh38 reference genome and the T2T reference genome (CHM13). SPECIFIC AIM TWO: Determine utility of
prior ancestry estimation for identifying the appropriate pangenome reference to further improve quality of short
and long read RNA seq alignments, compared to the GRCh38 reference genome, across HPRC reference
genomes (currently 47). SPECIFIC AIM THREE: Measure the QC metrics of short and long -read RNA seq data
aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome compared to individualized reference genomes.
 This project will provide training opportunities for faculty, post docs and students at MSM to enhance
workforce training in genomics. The implication of this project will help determine whether there is a benefit of
determining an individuals reference genome or using population based reference genomes enhances the
information available in RNA-seq datasets."
10871023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory estrogen-dependent disease, and it affects approximately 10-15% of
women of reproductive age. Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is often delayed an average of 7-10 years after
the onset of symptoms due to heterogeneity of symptoms. The current gold standard for diagnosis is invasive
laparoscopic surgery coupled with histological verification which is associated with high surgical risk. Therefore,
the capability to detect endometriosis early and reliably by employing a safe and noninvasive exhaled
breath-based screening approach represents a major breakthrough in diagnosis and treatment of
endometriosis. Exhaled breath-based technologies can also achieve early detection of endometriosis since the
metabolic changes are reflected in exhaled breath during the initial stages of the disease. However, one of the
major obstacles in applying exhaled breath-based disease detection in clinical settings is that current VOC
sensors are not adequately sensitive and reliable. While gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
based component-wise gas mixture classification technique is sensitive, the performance of this technology is
severely impacted by very low concentrations of several target VOCs (parts per billion-ppb to parts per trillion-
ppt) associated with different diseases. Portable engineered gas sensors or ‘electronic noses’ are not as
sensitive or reliable as their biological counterparts (e.g., dog’s nose). The innovation of this study comes
from the forward bioengineering approach of directly harnessing the power of an entire biological
olfactory system and addition of biological neural computations for data analysis. This proposal builds on
and extends our latest published work where we demonstrated that the brain-based sensing technology can
detect human oral cancer from emitted VOC mixtures of cell cultures (in vitro). In Aim 1, we will detect and
distinguish between endometriosis vs. healthy cells by analyzing the cell culture (both 2-D and 3-D) headspace
VOC mixtures and compare the detection performance with the gold standard of gas sensing technology (e.g.,
GC-MS). In Aim 2, we will quantify the brain-based sensor’s performance for detection of urinary VOC profiles
from a healthy vs. endometriosis murine model during the course of the disease progression. Our long-term goal
is to transition this ‘disease sniffing neuron’ technology towards a sensitive, reliable, real time, and portable
exhaled breath-based endometriosis screening device."

 Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, are debilitating
and highly prevalent chronic conditions that result from pathogenic inflammatory responses. The major
histocompatibility (MHC) region on chromosome 6, which contains the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and
other immune-related genes, has the strongest genetic association with autoimmune diseases, but the exact
molecular mechanisms behind MHC disease risk are yet unsolved. Previous research has primarily explored
how coding variants affect HLA protein structure and antigen binding, but recent studies highlight the potential
role of noncoding variants in regulating HLA expression. Increased HLA expression could play a causal role in
disease through higher levels of antigen presentation to autoreactive T cells. There is a critical need to better
understand how a cell’s biological state impacts genetic control of HLA expression.
 The proposed research will test the hypothesis that genetic variation in the MHC region modulates HLA
expression in a cell-state-dependent and disease-relevant manner. The applicant will develop innovative
computational methods to integrate both genetic and single-cell transcriptomic data sampled from inflamed
tissues and controls across multiple human immune-mediated disease contexts, comprising >1,088,000 cells
from 384 individuals. Specifically, the study aims to (1) quantify the effect of genetic variation on HLA
expression in key immune and stromal cell states (T, B, fibroblast, and myeloid cells), (2) identify expression
programs and transcriptional regulators that modulate the effect of HLA regulatory variants, and (3) link HLA
regulatory variation to autoimmune disease risk loci. This work will generate a resource detailing HLA
expression across diverse cell states and identify the specific contexts in which genetic variants regulate HLA
expression. This will deepen our fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying autoimmune disease
risk and may pave the way for better informed therapeutic strategies.
 The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to: (A) strengthen an understanding of the genetic
and immune basis of human diseases, (B) cultivate strong skills in computational genomics methods
development, (C) develop data science skills in statistical genetics and computational immunology, (D)
improve understanding of the clinical aspects of autoimmune diseases, and (E) develop professional scientific
communication skills. An enriching and supportive training environment and close mentorship by experts in
complex trait genetics, immunology, and single-cell methods development will equip the applicant with
knowledge and skills to become an effective physician-scientist who can contribute to the field of disease-
focused computational immunogenomics."
10870241,"Project Summary
Fungal infection with Histoplasma species (Hc) is highly prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi river valley regions
of the US and is a frequent cause of fungal respiratory illness. Macrophages are the frontline effector cells that
engulf Hc but only kill yeast cells upon activation. Emerging evidence indicates that macrophages and other
innate cells develop a “memory” phenotype by remembering a prior microbial encounter. This process has been
referred to as trained immunity. Trained macrophages manifest heightened antimicrobial defenses independent
of T and B cells. Thus, training represents an alternative for improving the outcome of infection in patients with
AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions. Metabolic changes, in particular, elevated glycolysis and de-
creased oxidative phosphorylation are key to the development of trained macrophages. The precise mechanisms
underlying training have not been fully uncovered, and the effect of trained macrophages on Hc resistance is
unknown. We have generated exciting data that training human and mouse macrophages enables them to elim-
inate infection with yeast cells independent of exogenous cytokine activation. Using molecular, immunologic,
and metallomic approaches, we discovered that the labile zinc content of macrophages is diminished during
training concomitant with an elevated expression of the zinc binding proteins metallothioneins (MTs)1&2. Trained
macrophages inhibit Hc growth in a zinc-dependent manner. How the MT-zinc axis influences the development
and execution of memory in macrophages is not understood. In this proposal, we will investigate the hypothesis
that zinc homeostasis is a central element in sculpting macrophage memory. Aim 1 will explore the role of gran-
ulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and low zinc in the development of memory. We chose to study
this cytokine since many of its effects on zinc mirror that of training. Aim 2 will determine how MTs1&2 orchestrate
macrophage training. Aim 3 will decipher how the MT-zinc axis regulates glycolytic reprogramming and investi-
gate how metabolic changes shape the anti-Hc response of trained macrophages. Collectively, these studies
will provide new knowledge regarding zinc regulation of trained immunity."
10871193,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US alone, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) has resulted in more than 25.8 million infections,
266,000 hospitalizations, and nearly 1,000 deaths among children. Although COVID-19 is typically more mild in
children compared to adults, it remains in the top ten causes of pediatric death and is the leading infectious
cause of death for children. Children also experience complications associated with COVID-19, including
respiratory failure, acute cardiac, kidney and liver injury, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children
(MIS-C). The risk of COVID-19 is two-fold higher among children 0-2 years old and children with chronic lung
disease, neurologic disorders, cardiovascular disease, prematurity, and airway abnormalities. Following the
emergence of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased by 6-8
fold among young children, and an unanticipated increase in the incidence and morbidity attributed to other
circulating respiratory virus infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have been observed in young
children.
Other respiratory viruses co-circulating with SARS-CoV-2 may exacerbate the morbidity and mortality
attributed to pediatric respiratory infections. Co-infections between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, RSV, and
rhinoviruses are more common among young children 0-2 years of age compared to adults and are associated
with more severe illness and frequent complications. Despite this, existing data on SARS-CoV-2 co-infections
have predominantly come from small, regionally-specific samples of children 0-18 years old, and the ill-health
effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 co-infections in young children and children with underlying health
conditions (i.e., those most vulnerable to severe illness) are not well understood. Although COVID-19 vaccines
have been available to children since June 2022, the effects of vaccination on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 co-
infections are unknown.
Using national commercial insurance and multi-state Medicaid claims data from a cohort of >100,965 SARS-
CoV-2-infected U.S. children, our overall goal is to characterize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections and
the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on disease severity. As of May 2023, just 13% of children 6 months to 4
years old have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine – rates lower than any other age group in the
U.S. Completion of this proposed research will provide more comprehensive evidence on the burden of
COVID-19 in young children and potential benefits associated with pediatric COVID-19 vaccination. Such
evidence is useful for understanding the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in healthy and high-risk
children and will aid evidence-based pediatric immunization policy and informed decision-making among
parents/caregivers of young children and their healthcare provider(s)

10871244,"Sortilin-1 (SORT1) belongs to the VPS10P-domain containing receptors that also includes SORLA and
SORCS1-3. Previous studies have implicated SORT1 as a key regulator of pathological processes in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). For instance, a recent Genome-Wide Association study
(GWAS) identified SORT1 as a novel risk allele for Late-onset AD, and gave SORT1 a tier 1 priority score for
future investigations based on quantitative trait loci analysis. SORT1 is also a receptor that helps regulate the
availability of Progranulin (PGRN), one of the three most common genetic causes of familial Frontotemporal
Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). Molecular studies have shown that SORT1 is proteolytically processed into a large
extracellular Amino-terminus (ectodomain) and a small Carboxy-terminal fragment (CTF). Interestingly, these
Sortilin C-terminal fragments (Sorfra) accumulate as novel senile plaque-like lesions in human AD patient brain
samples, but not in rodent or primate models of AD, suggesting a possible human-specific aspect of AD/FTD
pathology. However, while a significant body of work has linked SORT1 with AD and FTD, much less is known
regarding the molecular mechanisms of SORT1 processing itself. We performed preliminary protein interactome
screens of SORT1 and identified NSG1 and NSG2 as binding partners of SORT1, proteins that have never
previously been associated with AD or FTD. Our preliminary data confirm the NSG-SORT1 interactions, and
further demonstrate that NSG1 is downregulated in post-mortem brain samples from both AD and FTD patients.
In addition, this is correlated with differential SORT1 processing, where reduced NSG1 correlates with increased
CTF levels. The studies proposed in this application are designed to test the exciting and novel hypothesis that
NSG1 and NSG2 are altered in the brains of AD/FTD patients, and whether these alterations may differentially
affect SORT1 proteolytic cleavage and/or trafficking. We propose to explore this hypothesis through two Specific
Aims, the first of which will make use of post-mortem human and rodent brain samples to correlate NSG1-2
expression levels with AD/FTD disease subtypes and SORT1 proteolytic processing. The second Aim will then
use in vitro human and rodent neurons to test whether altering levels of NSG1-2 differentially affects SORT1
processing, trafficking, as well as AD/FTD-related pathology (phosphorylated Tau and TDP-43, as well as Aβ
levels). The results of the proposed studies will identify novel molecular mechanisms that may underlie the
progression of AD/FTD pathology, and provide critical preliminary data and scientific rationale to initiate a new
avenue of study and the possible development of novel therapeutics for AD and FTD."
10871477,"Hyperandrogenic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a high prevalence of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia that result in an
increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, type 2 diabetes and CVD events. Surveys also show
significant dissatisfaction amongst women with PCOS regarding long-term counselling and management of their
cardiometabolic risk. Although lifestyle interventions and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are recommended as
first-line treatment for PCOS, there are no dietary or pharmacological recommendations for prevention of CVD
risk in PCOS, indicating a considerable knowledge gap. Resistant starch, a type of dietary fiber, may offer a
promising solution with significant improvements in CVD risk factors and CVD events in the general population.
In addition, resistant starch use has been associated with increased abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-
producing gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria, and SCFAs in the general population. Recent studies also
showed that Bifidobacteria and SCFAs are decreased in women with PCOS, and that exposure to a healthy gut
microbiome via cohousing or fecal microbiome transplantation improved cardiometabolic parameters in PCOS
rodent models. These studies indicate that modulation of the gut microbiome may be a potential novel treatment
target for cardiometabolic dysregulation in PCOS. While increased dietary fiber improves cardiometabolic and
gut health in the general population, the impact of resistant starch supplementation on cardiometabolic
parameters or the gut microbiome in women with PCOS treated with OCPs has not been investigated. Use of
OCPs especially in women with overweight /obesity is associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension and glucose
dysregulation. We will test the hypothesis that treatment with resistant starch in combination with OCPs
results in improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, as well as specific gut microbes and metabolites,
such as Bifidobacteria and SCFAs compared to OCPs alone. In Aim 1, we will enroll 100 women with
hyperandrogenic PCOS and overweight/obesity in a double-blind placebo-controlled 2-arm RCT for 12 weeks:
Arm A) OCP + resistant starch and Arm B) OCP + maltodextrin (resistant starch placebo). We will investigate
how resistant starch treatment in combination with OCPs improves individual cardiometabolic parameters,
markers of insulin resistance, glucoregulatory status and inflammation compared to OCPs alone. In Aim 2, we
will use metagenomics and metabolomics to determine how OCPs + resistant starch impact abundances of
Bifidobacteria and other gut microbes, microbial genes and SCFAs compared to OCPs alone and if changes in
the gut microbiome correlate with changes in specific cardiometabolic parameters. Results from this proposal
will provide support for the implementation of a low-cost, nutritional therapy to counter negative cardiometabolic
effects of OCPs and improve long-term CVD risk in the high risk PCOS population and provide key insights into
the impact of resistant starch treatment on gut health in women with PCOS."
10871478,"A pulse-driven micropump for transdermal drug delivery
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ambulatory infusion pumps are an increasingly prescribed therapy modality for cancer and diabetes patients,
post-operative pain management, and more. They allow patients to receive necessary medication infusions,
but are often bulky, tethered to the user with tubing, and associated with pain at the insertion site. These
shortcomings make drug regimen adherence harder for infusion pump users, particularly those with chronic
conditions. To eliminate barriers to infusion therapy adherence, there is a critical need for compact, lightweight
infusion devices that don’t impede physical activity. Our long-term goal is to improve infusion therapy
adherence by developing featherweight arterial pulse-driven infusion pump technology that eliminates the need
for painful cannula insertions and motors and batteries to facilitate pumping. Our overall objectives in this
project, the next steps toward our long-term goal, are to (i) characterize the infusion rate capabilities of a
prototype pulse-driven micropump based on our recent advances in bio-inspired microfluidic pump technology,
and (ii) tune the micropump design to deliver a set of target infusion rates within its range by way of physical
experiments, computational modeling, and AI-guided optimization. Our central hypothesis is that our pulse-
driven microfluidic pump technology, which mimics natural biological function, can provide drug delivery rates
appropriate for clinical applications like ambulatory chemotherapy for a wide range of users with varying
arterial pulse profiles. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary data demonstrating the proof-of-concept that our
prototype micropump can be powered by the human radial artery pulse and produce flow rates appropriate for
chemotherapy and insulin delivery. The project’s rationale is that, before the proposed pulse-driven micropump
can be developed for clinical use, its capabilities must be characterized, allowing its design to be optimized for
specific applications. To attain these objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued. First, we will
determine the dependence of the micropump flow rate on device design parameters and arterial pulse
characteristics using in vitro and in vivo tests with rapid prototype micropumps produced using microfluidic
fabrication techniques and 3D printing; next, we will develop a 3D finite element model (FEM) of the prototype
micropump; finally, we will use an evolutionary algorithm along with human subject and porcine skin
transdermal flow rate testing to develop an initial set of 6 wearable infusion patch pump designs integrated with
microneedle arrays. Upon project completion, we expect our contribution to be a featherweight pulse-driven
infusion pump capable of producing a wide range of infusion rates that can be integrated into low-cost,
disposable infusion devices the size of a nicotine patch, or in state-of-the-art closed-loop and implantable
infusions systems, greatly reducing the footprint of both types of devices. This advance in infusion technology
is expected to increase users’ adherence to their drug regimens, reduce risk of diabetic hyperglycemic crises,
and improve quality of life for many patients. The technology has an additional potential application in self-
administered vaccine patches."

The regulation and mis-regulation of sphingolipid metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs at
multiple bio-molecular levels—gene mutation, enzyme abundances and activities, as well as sphingolipid
precursors and products. The innovative aspect of the Program Project has systematically collected deep
biomolecular profiles of accrued patient samples and relevant AML cell lines. The new Systems Metabolomics
Core (Core C) will help the larger P01 project team to generate testable hypotheses by integrating the
systems-level datasets from individual research projects and the other research cores. The goal is to inform
critical Project-level decisions involving sphingolipid-targeted therapies. Core C will pursue the following
Specific Aims: 1) evaluate linear and nonlinear predictive models of outcome and response based on patient-
specific biomolecules and (cyto)genetics; 2) test data-driven predictive models of outcomes and response
based on patient-specific, gene–transcript–lipid–activity signatures; and 3) integrate gene, transcript, and
metabolite profiles of AML patients with a reconstructed sphingolipid module of the human metabolic network.
Core C leadership is comprised of experts in data-driven cancer modeling, metabolic network reconstruction,
and systems biology. Therefore, the Core is poised to adapt its approaches to the changing needs of the

This application is for a K08 award for Rebecca Berhanu MD, an Instructor at Boston University’s Department of
Global Health in the School of Public Health, who is training to become an independent investigator in the field
of molecular epidemiology and tuberculosis (TB) transmission research. TB is the leading infectious cause of
death globally and the number one cause of death amongst people with HIV. The identification of recent TB
transmission clusters by whole genome sequencing (WGS) methods offers unique insight into transmission
patterns which cannot be obtained through traditional contact tracing.
The overall research objective is to use WGS coupled with molecular clock, phylogenic and transmission cluster
analysis to characterize transmission of rifampin and multi-drug resistant (RR/MDR) TB in Johannesburg, South
Africa. The aims of the study are to: 1) Use WGS data to calculate the molecular clock of RR/MDR-TB, 2) Use
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based cluster analysis and Bayesian transmission analysis to identify
recent TB transmission clusters or RR/MDR-TB, and evaluate the impact of HIV status, CD4 count and
antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the likelihood of transmitting TB and 3) Determine if WGS transmission cluster
identification augmented with demographic and social-network data can identify non-household locations of
recent RR/MDR-TB transmission.
Dr. Berhanu will receive mentorship from a team of inter-disciplinary experts in TB epidemiology, bioinformatics
and TB genomics. Her primary mentor, Dr Horsburgh, is a Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at Boston
University and has over 30 years’ experience in TB clinical and translational research. Her co-primary mentor,
Dr. Karen Jacobson, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Boston University, is an expert in TB epidemiology
in high-burden settings and has worked extensively in South Africa using TB molecular data. Dr. Berhanu’s
Advisory Board includes Dr. Maha Farhat, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Information
at
Harvard University,
who has published extensively on resistance mutation characterization and markers of recent transmission using
TB genomic data; Dr. Nazir Ismail, head of the Centre for Tuberculosis of the NICD in Johannesburg, is an expert
in TB molecular epidemiology, and Dr. Evan Johnson, Associate Professor of Medicine and Biostatistics at
Boston University, with expertise in bioinformatics methodology. Dr. Berhanu’s training plan links to the proposed
research aims: establish a solid foundation in epidemiology; and develop new skills in bioinformatics,
phylogenetics and transmission analysis using WGS data. Training will be accomplished through a combination
of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums in South Africa and Boston. These training and research
activities will allow Dr. Berhanu to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 using
molecular and social network data to identify transmission hotspots and areas for targeted case-finding."

happen each year in the United States. The long-term goal of this project is to identify new therapeutic strategies
to overcome chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The objective of this proposal
is to identify biological pathways that can be targeted in addition to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
to promote apoptosis of disseminated cancer cells. The central hypothesis is that EGFR inhibition leads to
activation of cellular stress responses that can be targeted with pro-apoptotic agents. The goal at the completion
of this project is for the results to immediately translate to the clinical setting and provide options for current

10879089,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Since 2017, there has been an exponential growth in youths’ use of electronic nicotine delivery systems
(ENDS), both nationally and in the state of Hawai‘i [1, 2]. Recent surveillance data has indicated that 18% of all
middle school youth in the state of Hawai‘i currently use an electronic vapor product, ranking first nationally
among all states collecting data on middle school youth [1]. Of these youth, 30% are of Native Hawaiian or
Pacific Islander ancestry, representing the highest percentage of ENDS use among major ethnic groups in
Hawai‘i. Despite these alarming trends, there have been no ENDS prevention programs developed and
evaluated for youth in Hawai‘i or for Native Hawaiian youth [3]. Therefore, the purpose of this research
proposal is to develop and evaluate a culturally grounded, ENDS prevention intervention for rural Hawaiian
youth. This will be accomplished through two specific aims. AIM 1 (Years 1-3) are focused on pre-intervention
and intervention development. In Year 1, youth focus groups will be conducted to assess the environmental
demands related to ENDS use in rural Hawai‘i. In Year 2, specific ENDS-related problem situations (i.e.,
situations that increase risk for ENDS use) will be extracted from the Year 1 focus groups and prioritized
through survey methods with 200-250 predominately Native Hawaiian youth across 16 different
middle/intermediate schools on Hawai‘i Island. In Year 3, five situations found to be the most frequently
experienced and/or difficult to manage by youth surveyed in Year 2 will serve as the foundation for the
development of narrative scripts. Three of these scripts will be cast and filmed on location on Hawai‘i Island by
a professional film director, and will be edited into three short films, 6-8 video clips, and 6-8 professional
photos or production stills. Similar to our prior drug prevention research in rural Hawai‘i [4], classroom-based
lessons will be created to support the short films. Additional lessons and videos from an evidence-based,
culturally grounded substance abuse prevention curriculum for Hawaiian youth (Ho‘ouna Pono) [5] will be
used to create a modular classroom curriculum. The video clips and professional photography/production stills
will be embedded with prevention messaging, and will be used for a social and print media campaign to
reinforce the classroom curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 4-5) is to evaluate the ENDS prevention intervention
(classroom curriculum plus social/print media campaign) across all middle/intermediate public or public-
charter schools (N = 16) and up to 11 different cultural immersion charter schools on Hawai‘i Island using a
dynamic wait-listed control group design [6]."
10879091,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The economic and social burden of the treatment of infectious and
chronic diseases is enormous, >$300B annually. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic alone will
cost the U.S. economy roughly $8 trillion over the next decade without an effective drug to date.
The emergence of drug resistant microbes, the diminishing supply of novel classes of antibiotics,
and the dramatic reduction in R&D of anti-infective, anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory
agents have further amplified public health concerns. Fungi are prolific producers of anti-
microbial secondary metabolites (SM) and since the turn of the century have provided 45% of
bioactive molecules from all microbial sources. However, environmental filamentous fungi and
fungal SM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) remain largely untapped due to difficulties in
efficiently handling and expressing these SM BGCs. This research proposal will advance the
science of functional SM metagenomics, and will further advance our newly-developed fungal
artificial chromosome (FAC) technology by integrating Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS), artificial
intelligence (AI), FAC heterologous expression, and direct Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
analysis. Our methodologies enable precise capture of full-length SM BGCs from any fungus,
and heterologous expression of large intact silent SM BGCs-containing FAC clones for high
yields of natural products (NPs). Our goals are to improve the prediction of novel BGCs and
their compound production, and to discover novel NPs for clinical development of novel
antibiotics and other drug leads. In proof-concept research, we successfully predicted and
captured the FAC-BGC of novel antibiotic berkeleylactone A and 136 BGCs from two different
fungi by FAC-NGS. Phenomenally, we achieved at least 60% yields of discreet NP compounds
as FAC crude extracts by heterologous expression of 5 of 17 BGC-FACs. We also elucidate the
structures of 15 NP molecules with diverse activities, including TWO novel compounds by direct
NMR analysis of FAC crude extracts, due to the high yield of some compounds. In this Phase II
study, we will further improve our in-house FAC-NGS-AI pipeline to better predict novel fungal
BGCs and their NPs, increasing the compound hit rate to 50~70% with high yield. We will
completely dissect the berkeleylactone BGC and discover novel derivatives of this new antibiotic
of homologous BGCs of other fungi. We will also study twelve fungi (ten fungi with no reference
genomic sequences available) with an estimated 800 BGCs. This technology should improve
fungal SM discovery 100~1000 fold and result in the discovery of at least five novel antibiotics,
and other drug leads from un-studied/un-sequenced fungi of the toxic Berkeley Pit."

We will establish a new Pittsburgh Craniofacial Sciences Training Program (PCSTP) at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (Pitt Dental) to train and mentor a new generation of leaders in Dental
Oral and Craniofacial (DOC) sciences. Our goal is to address the critical shortage of craniofacial
biologists nationwide through the PCSTP. Pitt Dental is an ideal academic setting for a high-caliber
program, including strong institutional investment in internationally recognized research programs in
craniofacial genetics and regenerative medicine. Indeed, Pitt Dental has ranked in the top 10 dental schools
receiving NIDCR funding each of the past 6 years, while the University has ranked 6th or higher nationally in
total NIH funding for more than a decade. Concerted efforts to grow the research enterprise at Pitt Dental over
the last 15 years led to a doubling in the number of accomplished research faculty and the completion of a new
state-of-the-art research tower in 2015. The thriving Pitt Dental research ecosystem is multi- and
interdisciplinary and team-based. Our current oral and craniofacial sciences trainees work alongside PhD
students from the Departments of Bioengineering (School of Engineering) and Human Genetics (Graduate
School of Public Health), all of whom identify themselves as craniofacial scientists. Pitt Dental leadership fully
recognizes the strategic importance of our program and has committed significant resources in personnel and
support for the students in the PCSTP. The PCSTP will be administered and managed in the Department of
Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, with additional faculty from other Pitt Dental or University departments
(primarily Prosthodontics, Human Genetics, and Bioengineering). Trainees will be admitted to the Oral and
Craniofacial Sciences PhD program, and following the completion of their first year (supported by Pitt Dental),
the strongest students will be considered for acceptance into the PCSTP. Postdoctoral trainees can apply to
participate in either the conventional postdoctoral training or enroll in the PhD program for individuals holding a
DDS/DMD. Finally, the R90 component will provide opportunities for individuals with foreign DDS/DMD
degrees to participate. The PCSTP provides courses, research experiences, seminar series, journal clubs, an
annual symposium, and an annual retreat (for PCSTP trainees and faculty only) and will leverage University
resources, such as training in artificial intelligence, data science and the responsible conduct of research
(RCR) and in methods to enhance reproducibility. Our trainees will benefit from a wealth of mentors, seminars,
conferences, shared facilities, intramural pilot awards, and specialized training and experiences available
through hundreds of laboratories and clinics across the six schools of the health sciences and the Pitt Clinical
and Translational Sciences Institute (including its RCR Center and Institute for Clinical Research Education)."
10873661,"The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Occupational Health Surveillance
Program (OHSP) is proposing to build on its extensive experience and network of partners to
continue and enhance the Expanded Program for occupational health surveillance and
prevention. The overarching aim of the program is to reduce the incidence and severity of work-
related injuries and illnesses and improve worker health in Massachusetts. This proposal has
strong support from state agency leadership and has leveraged additional state and federal
resources to supplement its core surveillance funding.
 Work-related injuries and illnesses are preventable. While Massachusetts has made
progress in improving worker health and safety, work-related injuries and illnesses remain a
significant public health threat. One to two workers are fatally injured each week in
Massachusetts. For every fatality, there are an estimated 890 nonfatal injuries and illnesses
reported by employers, amounting to over 86,000 work-related injuries and illnesses per year.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the true number is much higher. As has been
demonstrated recently with COVID-19, this burden falls disproportionately on low wage workers,
primarily immigrants and workers of color, who are often employed in more dangerous jobs.
Work-related injuries and illnesses have serious health and economic costs for workers, their
family, employers, and society. While the full costs in Massachusetts have not been calculated,
over $1.26 billion dollars were paid in Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation benefits in 2018.
 The purpose of this proposal is to continue and enhance OHSP’s Fundamental Project
and three of its currently funded Expanded Projects to meet the identified needs of the state.
OHSP proposes broadening the scope of the Fundamental Project to provide more cross-
project coordination and intra-departmental collaboration on complex evolving issues, such as
COVID-19 and health equity. The proposal builds on our commitment to underserved workers
by using a health equity framework to guide our work. This proposal will expand OHSP’s ability
to use health informatics and to collaborate with partners in order to identify and respond to
unsafe work conditions and ameliorate their impact on the health and quality of life of workers.
OHSP proposes to continue and enhance its three Expanded Projects on worker fatalities,
health care workers, and work-related respiratory diseases. Ultimately, the proposed Expanded
Program will lead to reductions in hazards in MA workplaces, improved worker health, and lower
costs."
10877304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Identification of interventions that extend mouse lifespan provides new insights into mechanisms of longevity
determination in mammals and may lay the groundwork for eventual anti-aging therapies in humans. The NIA
Interventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates drugs proposed to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of
aging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the
research community are tested, in parallel, at three sites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan and
University of Texas), using very similar, standardized protocols, and using enough genetically heterogeneous
mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any
two of the test sites. One hundred and two such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 66 distinct
agents, have been initiated in the first twenty years of the ITP. Thirty-six experiments have involved
comparative tests of multiple doses of effective agents, variable starting ages, or alternative dosing schedules.
Statistically significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexes, have been documented and then confirmed
for NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, 17-α-estradiol (17aE2), and canagliflozin. Significant effects were also noted
for Protandim, glycine, meclizine, captopril, and astaxanthin. Lifespan trials are now underway for 25 new
agents. ITP survival results have also documented longevity benefits from four agents started in middle-age:
rapamycin, acarbose, 17aE2, and canagliflozin. A Collaborative Interactions Program (CIP) has provided
tissues from ITP drug-treated mice to an open, growing, international network of scientific collaborators,
meeting 26 requests from 17 distinct laboratories in the previous five-year period. Plans for the next five-year
period include additional lifespan (""Stage 1"") studies, detailed studies (""Stage 2"") of drugs found to increase
lifespan, transition from the CIP to an Interventions Biospecimens Repository, additional diagnostic specificity
in pathological assessments, inclusion of RNA-Seq data in all Stage 2 studies, and comprehensive
pharmacokinetic assessments of drugs found to increase lifespan, as well as continued collaborative work with
a network of scientists to study drug effects on postulated aging mechanisms and links to disease. Site-specific
studies at The Jackson Laboratory will add a tests for heart, kidney, and bladder function in Stage 2 studies,
and image analysis of tissues using machine learning. The work proposed should allow the ITP to continue to
make major contributions to mammalian aging biology."

 This competing continuation proposal for Years 35-40 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
cooperative agreement, including the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) sub-study, is in
response to NIA RFA #AG-24-010. The primary aim of the HRS and HCAP is to design, collect and distribute
longitudinal multi-disciplinary data to support research on aging, Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
(ADRD), and the health and well-being of the older population. This proposal seeks to collect three additional
waves of HRS panel data, one follow-up wave of HCAP data, continue collection of venous blood specimens,
continue collection of data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic, implement the next
scheduled refreshment by adding the second Gen-X cohort in 2028, continue to conduct off-year mail surveys,
and implement cost-saving innovations, including expansion of the internet mode for data collection. It will
continue the same expanded minority oversample design for the MidGENX cohort as was begun in 2010 and
continued through 2022 in which half the new sample consists of black or Hispanic households. The new
MidGENX cohort will be fully integrated into the HRS design, including collection of biomarkers, DNA, and
linkage consents to Social Security and other records as appropriate.
 HRS and HCAP provide uniquely rich, nationally representative longitudinal data that can simultaneously
support cross-sectional descriptions of the U.S. population age 51+, longitudinal studies of a given cohort over
a substantial period of time, and research on cross-cohort trends. The HRS and HCAP projects create a data
system extending beyond the core survey data. One component is linkages to administrative data, including
Social Security earnings and benefit records, Medicare utilization and diagnostic records, including Part C,
Minimum Data Set and Medicaid records, employer pension records, Veterans Health Administration data and

10883037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) that express the neuropeptide hypocretin/orexin (H/OX) are
critical regulators of sleep-wake architecture, arousal, and motivated behavior. The progressive destruction of
these neurons, and/or disrupted H/OX signaling, in humans causes a devastating, chronic neurological
disease—narcolepsy with cataplexy—which results in disordered wakefulness, loss of muscle control, and late-
onset metabolic effects. Experimental disruption of H/OX signaling in vertebrate animal models recapitulate
many of these symptoms including aberrant sleep-wake states. Despite the clear and conserved role of the H/OX
system in behavioral state control, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of H/OX synaptic function are not
well understood. Thus, the long-term objective of this proposal is to fill this knowledge gap by defining the
molecular machinery underlying the structure and function of H/OX synapses throughout the central nervous
system and illuminating the molecular pathways that drive their behavioral effects. To begin addressing this gap,
this proposal will build off the discovery that mRNA encoding the synaptic organizing protein complement C1q-
like 3 (C1QL3) is uniquely and robustly expressed in H/OX neurons, as identified in a recent transcriptomic
analysis of the LHA. Work in other circuits demonstrated that C1QL3 is important for establishing and maintaining
excitatory synapse density, and it was further shown that C1QL3 global deletion results in deficits in sleep-wake
behavior, reminiscent of features of human narcolepsy. C1QL3 was also shown to bind pre- and postsynaptic
proteins, one of which is also robustly expressed in H/OX neurons. Based on these strong preliminary data, the
hypothesis underlying this proposal is that C1QL3, together with its pre- and postsynaptic binding partners, forms
a novel trans-synaptic adhesion complex, which is necessary for both H/OX synaptic function and its role in
regulating behavioral state. This will be systematically investigated in the following three Specific Aims: 1) In Aim
1, C1QL3 will be visualized in H/OX cell bodies and axons at the light and ultrastructural level using a newly
developed epitope-tagged knockin mouse line, and effects of C1QL3 global and conditional knockout (cKO) and
overexpression on H/OX neuron fiber density and synaptic ultrastructure will be examined. 2) In Aim 2, the impact
of C1QL3 cKO and overexpression on excitatory synaptic function in targets of the H/OX system will be examined
using both in vitro slice electrophysiology and optogenetics, and on sleep-wake behavior using
electroencephalographic recording of vigilance states. 3) In Aim 3, the molecular mechanisms through which
C1QL3 contributes to a trans-synaptic adhesion complex will be dissected using biochemical assays, viral
manipulations, the novel epitope-tagged knockin mouse line, and super-resolution microscopy. This investigation
will not only provide critical mechanistic insight into the basic biology of excitatory synaptic transmission at H/OX
synapses, but also identify a novel molecular pathway through which H/OX signaling may be manipulated as a
therapeutic intervention in chronic neurological and sleep disorders."
10883035,"Human genetics reveals underlying biological mechanisms for human disease susceptibility and quantitative
trait variability. Random inheritance of parental alleles provides a natural experiment to test genes for a causal
role in human phenotypes. Understanding the variants, genes, and mechanisms that underlie human
phenotypic variability can have important therapeutic implications – drugs whose targets are supported by
human genetic evidence are more likely to be efficacious. Despite improvements in treatments for obesity
(particularly newly-approved terzepatide, whose targets both have support from our prior genetic studies),
obesity remains a pressing public health need, and the most effective therapies carry significant risks and cost.
Our prior and ongoing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated both known and novel genes
for anthropometric traits, including measures of obesity and height (the classical model polygenic trait).
However, translating genetic discovery into new biology and actionable mechanistic hypotheses remains
challenging. Fortunately, improved tools and new resources now enable more rapid progress on the journey
from genetic discovery to biological knowledge. We can benchmark and therefore rationally select powerful
computational tools and data sets that, especially in combination, more precisely implicate causal variants,
genes, and pathways. Newly available and much larger studies of rare variation, especially coding variation,
also help pinpoint relevant genes. Whole genome sequence data sets now allow queries of structural variants
whose often large effect sizes can reveal regulatory effects on causal genes. Expanded sample sizes for non-
European ancestries will increase power and permit a broader delineation of the phenotypic consequences of
causal variants. Functional studies can test hypotheses emerging from genetic and computational analyses,
especially if the functional assays are shown to be relevant by benchmarking them against genetic data.
This proposal builds on the ongoing, successful and global collaborations we established within the GIANT
consortium, which led to discovery of most of the common variants known to be associated with
anthropometric traits. We will leverage new collaborations and newly available genetic resources, with larger
and more diverse sample sizes. By covering the range of variants - common and rare, coding, noncoding, and
structural - we will more completely define the genetic basis of measures of obesity (BMI and WHR) and
height. We will use data-driven approaches to benchmark and select computational methods (to turn genetic
data into hypotheses about causal variants, genes, and mechanisms) and functional assays (to test these
hypotheses). Finally, we will examine, in diverse populations, the phenotypic and metabolic implications of
polygenic risk scores composed of associated variants (including meaningfully selected subsets). Our proposal
will also address as yet unanswered questions about the genetic architecture of polygenic traits, using novel
approaches to study sex differences and genetic interactions."
10884441,"Project Summary:
Physical mechanical processes are central to the morphogenesis of embryos and their organs. The
goal of this proposal is to apply a multi-scale analysis of the mechanics of convergent extension, identifying
biomechanical mechanisms that establish passive tissue properties such as stiffness as well as active
processes that generate forces of extension, regulate cell behaviors and tissue deformation, and how passive
mechanics and active force generating processes are coordinated within the frog embryo. Studies outlined in
this proposal will answer: (1) What are the molecular regulators of cell cortex mechanics and cell shape
change during dorsal axis elongation? We previously identified a form of ""mechanical maturation"" as cells
transition from undifferentiated progenitor to early ectodermal, mesodermal, or endodermal cell. To answer this
question we will identify regulators and test their role in cell cortex density and cell shape to elasticity and force
production. (2) How is force production coordinated from early to late elongation? Simulations and live-imaging
suggest cooperativity between anisotropic tissue tension and polarization of the cytoskeleton, ""cytoskeletal
focusing"". To answer this question we will quantify emergent focusing of actomyosin dynamics and test roles
for actin polymerization and myosin transport in elongation. (3) What is the role of mechanical strain energy in
sustaining convergent extension? Preliminary data reveals the existence of ""mechanical memory"" in dorsal
tissues to store and use mechanical strain energy during convergent extension. This aim will quantify
mechanical memory and the role of strain energy loss, e.g. strain energy dissipation in axis elongation. Results
from this project will complement ongoing efforts to identify the molecular regulators of morphogenesis by
providing a conceptual framework developing new hypotheses of morphogenesis and bioengineering tools to
test them. The significance of our work provides researchers a more complete understanding of the
contribution of cell- and tissue-mechanics to development, to understand the role of tissue mechanics in
oncogenesis, and to provide fundamental physical principles for future functional tissue engineers."
10884442,"Project Abstract:
 Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae
that colonizes urogenital, anal, and nasopharyngeal tissues. Locally in the United States the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a 67% increase of gonorrhea cases between 2013 – 2017 with >550,000
cases in 2017 alone. N. gonorrhoeae wreaks havoc on world health care systems causing pelvic inflammatory
disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancies. The bacteria can also be transmitted from mother to child during
birth and lead to blindness. If left untreated N. gonorrhoeae can cause gonococcemia resulting in skin infection,
arthritis or endocarditis. Pathogenic gonorrhea strains are increasingly resistant to common front-line antibiotics.
The WHO surveillance program reports resistance to most available antibiotics. Rampant resistance has caused
the CDC and the World Health Organization each to classify N. gonorrhoeae as a superbug and a future with an
untreatable gonococcal infection is a real possibility. Thus, there is significant unmet need to identify novel targets
and molecules with therapeutic potential. Studies proposed in this application build upon discoveries that FDA-
approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), such as acetazolamide and ethoxzolamide, display potent
antimicrobial activity, in an applicable clinical range, against N. gonorrhoeae. CAIs, and analogs we have
designed, also have no antimicrobial effect on commensal bacteria reducing the potential for problematic
dysbiosis caused by antibiotic treatment. We have shown that the molecules exhibit their antibiotic effect by
inhibiting the carbonic anhydrase from N. gonorrhoeae and have validated N. gonorrhoeae carbonic anhydrase
(NgCA) as a viable anti-gonococcal therapeutic target. Our team has improved the potency of the CAI-based
inhibitors from 4 µg/mL to 0.5 µg/mL. This proposal will continue lead optimization of CAI-based analogs using
structure-based design while incorporating modifications to improve permeability into the Gram-negative cell.
Molecules will be assessed in in vitro antimicrobial assays and prioritized analogs will progress to in vitro
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacologic profiling. Finally, top performing analogs will be assessed for in vivo
efficacy in various gonorrhea mouse models as well evaluated the in safety and pharmacokinetic assay to
support future lead selection and investigational new drug enabling studies."
10882396,"How the brain determines cerebral ventricular volume, and how that in turn affects brain function, are poorly
understood. In patients who develop idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) or low pressure
hydrocephalus after intracranial hemorrhage, infection or other brain insults, ventricular volume increases in the
absence of obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, sustained intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations or brain
atrophy. iNPH patients display motor apraxia, dementia and incontinence that are often improved by CSF
drainage, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Numerous studies suggest that ependymal motile cilia
dysfunction somehow leads to hydrocephalus, albeit via unclear mechanisms. Indeed, some investigators have
challenged this notion, suggesting instead that increased CSF production, decreased CSF absorption, or
abnormal brain development are responsible. Here we present evidence for an ependymal chemosensory-
mechanotransduction system that uses motile cilia to convert chemical signals to changes in flow that govern
ependymal cell junction assembly, ventricular wall stiffness and ependymal permeability. By controlling
ventricular compliance and the exchange of CSF between the ventricular and interstitial spaces, this system
regulates ventricular volume, the relative distribution and composition of fluid in the ventricular and interstitial
compartments, and neuronal activity, all without altering ICP. To elucidate why ventriculomegaly and
neurological deficits develop in iNPH, we sequenced DNA from iNPH patients to identify iNPH-associated
mutations. Most of the iNPH-associated mutations involved genes that encode proteins associated with cilia,
and all of the genes showed increased expression in ependymal or choroid plexus cells. iNPH-associated
mutations affecting CWH43 or AK9 occurred in 25% of iNPH patients. Mice harboring iNPH-associated CWH43
or AK9 mutations displayed decreased motile cilia number or motility, respectively, and developed
ventriculomegaly and gait imbalance characteristic of iNPH. We now show that the ventriculomegaly is
accompanied by normal ICP, increased ventricular compliance and permeability, and disassembly of ependymal
cell junctions. We and others have discovered multiple receptors that localize to ependymal motile cilia and
regulate CSF flow by modulating cilia beat frequency. Mutation of these receptors increases ventricular volume.
In normal mice, we find that flow is required to maintain ependymal cell junctions. This process involves activation
of ependymal Piezo1, TRPV4, and PKD2 mechanotransduction channels. Induced conditional deletion of Piezo1
or PKD2 in adult mice increases ventricular size. We observed a diurnal increase in ependymal permeability that
increases exchange between ventricular CSF and interstitial fluid during sleep. We find that ventriculomegaly in
CWH43 or AK9 mutant mice is associated with a task-dependent decrease in neuronal activation in the
hippocampus and parietal cortex that may underlie the dementia and motor apraxia of iNPH. We will examine
how this ependymal chemosensory-mechanotransduction system regulates ventricular size and brain function."
10884458,"ABSTRACT
Aggression is an important social behavior widely observed across species, including humans. It is
considered an innate behavior because its expression requires no learning. With the right sensory
trigger, often one associated with conspecific competitors, aggression is expressed as a series of
stereotyped motor actions. However, the readiness to express aggression, or aggressiveness, varies
widely among individuals. Experiences of winning and losing are known to contribute to this individual
variability. Winning leads to an increase in aggressiveness while losing decreases aggressiveness, a
phenomenon termed the winner and loser effect. While key hormonal events accompanying winning
and losing have been identified, the neural mechanisms underlying the winner and loser effect remain
poorly understood. We hypothesize that the aggressiveness of an individual is determined by the
efficiency of sensory-motor transformation of the aggression circuit, which is determined by the
biophysical properties and synaptic transmission of cells in the circuit. Winning and losing experiences
alter the excitability and/or communication of aggression-related cells and ultimately changes the
readiness to attack. Leveraging upon our deep understanding of the aggression circuit in male mice, in
this study we will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. First, we will simultaneously record
the aggression-cue evoked in vivo neural responses and glutamatergic release from 13 brain regions
along the sensory-motor pathway that mediates aggression and examine the response changes over
repeated winning and losing experiences. Second, we will use in vitro patch clamp recording to
investigate the intrinsic properties and synaptic transmission of aggression-related cells from animals
with repeated winning, losing and social interaction experiences. Our preliminary results revealed that
the aggression circuit undergoes two-stage plasticity, first synaptic plasticity and then cellular plasticity,
over repeated winning. Following up on this initial finding, in Aim 3, we will address the contribution of
synaptic plasticity to short- and long-term winner and loser effect and the induction of cellular plasticity.
The significance of our study is that it addresses a fundamental neuroscience question -- how social
experience alters the brain to influence innate behaviors. It will also provide new understanding
regarding the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in aggressiveness. Such
understanding could ultimately lead to novel strategies for treating psychiatric patients suffering from
exaggerated aggression."

Elderly persons are susceptible to injury with compromised regenerative capacity of the skeletal muscle, leading
to gradual muscle weakness and loss of physical activity. Impaired myogenic satellite cell function is associated
with muscle aging. While it is known that exercise has many beneficial effects on aging and can improve satellite
cell function, searching for the putative myogenic factors that facilitate exercise-mediated improvement of muscle
function presents an attractive area for geriatric research. We know that exercise induces secretion of MG53
from skeletal muscle into circulation, which serves as a myokine to protect multiple tissues from injuries. However,
exercise-induced MG53 release is severely attenuated in aging. Chronic oxidative stress associated with aging
leads to MG53 aggregation that compromises MG53’s function in tissue repair and regeneration. We hypothesize
rejuvenating MG53’s myokine function will have benefits to aging. We have produced a transgenic mouse model
with sustained elevation of MG53 in the bloodstream, and found that these mice display remarkable muscle
regeneration following injury. We have data to show that treatment with recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53)
protein promotes proliferation and protects against stress-induced injury to muscle satellite cells. Therefore, we
propose to test if improvement of muscle satellite cell function by MG53 can provide long-term benefits to muscle
aging. Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation associated with aging may cause tissue injury and
consequently the elevation of MG53 in circulation. We will use a combination of live cell imaging, proteomic, and
CRISPR-gene editing tools to test if post-translational modification of MG53 in the serum can be a contributing
factor for MG53’s compromised tissue repair function during aging. Outcomes of the studies in this project can
lay the foundation and pave the way for our long-term goal of translating the basic findings of the benefits of
MG53 into therapeutic treatments of age-related muscle dysfunctions."
10883121,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability that reduces productivity and quality of life at tremendous
economic cost. Despites its prevalence and cost, there is no therapy that prevents or cures OA. Synovial
inflammation (synovitis), has been linked with pain, disease severity and progression of knee OA and is
increasingly recognized for its role in the onset and pathogenesis of OA. However, studies of synovitis in OA
have been limited by a lack of non-invasive and non-contrast methods to evaluate its role in whole-joint disease,
particularly in early progression and in response to treatment. MRI has become the hallmark for imaging of OA
yet conventional MRI struggles to differentiate synovial hypertrophy from adjacent fluid, thus making it difficult to
identify and characterize synovitis. Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, following intravenous injection of a gadolinium-
based contrast-agent, provides contrast to the highly vascularized synovium and is the current reference
standard for imaging synovitis15. However, added time, cost, and contraindications in patients with renal
dysfunction, have limited use of CE-MRI in OA. There remains a critical need for new, validated, and translatable
imaging tools to better evaluate the role of synovitis in OA pathogenesis and response to treatment.
MRI has shown promise to use differences in relaxation and diffusion properties between synovium and joint
fluid to not only provide contrast to synovium but to also evaluate inflammatory activity without contrast injection.
However, technical challenges remain for detection of low-grade hypertrophy, as well as isolating synovium and
reducing distortions in diffusion MRI. Further, validation studies are necessary to understand these NC MRI
markers and evaluate their utility as a target to predict and monitor treatment response and OA progression
This project aims to develop and optimize non-contrast MRI methods to assess synovitis in knee OA, to validate
these methods against histology, and to evaluate their ability to predict whole joint disease progression and as
a target and monitor of treatment response. Our Specific Aims are (1a) to develop Non-Contrast MRI methods
for assessing synovial hypertrophy and inflammation across both knees; (1b) to validate the sensitivity and
specificity of these approaches against gold standard histologic measures of hypertrophy and inflammatory
markers and reference contrast-based imaging metrics; and [2] to evaluate the potential of NC-MRI synovitis
measures to predict and characterize treatment response to anti-inflammatory OA treatment (2a) as well as to
predict OA progression and evaluate whole-joint spatial tissue relationships (2b).
The significance of this work is new non-invasive and non-contrast tools that greatly expand the ability to
evaluate synovitis in all aspects of OA: early diagnosis, pathogenesis and progression, as well as endotype
evaluation and treatment monitoring. The innovation of this project is the development of novel NC methods to
assess synovitis in OA and its role in OA pathogenesis and response to treatment. Our investigative team
includes experts in novel imaging techniques, clinical and research studies of OA, and musculoskeletal clinicians."

 The immune system is capable of mounting a robust anti-cancer response. However, cancer cells can
disrupt this immune response, hijacking immune checkpoint mechanisms which act as brakes on the
endogenous anti-cancer response. Antibodies that block immune checkpoints (e.g., a-PD-L1, a-PD-1, and a-
CTLA4) have revolutionized cancer treatments, yet, only a fraction of patients respond. Understanding the
underlying mechanisms that promote a durable anti-tumor response to checkpoint blockade therapy is crucial
to develop effective therapeutics that can treat a wider range of cancer patients. The gut microbiota is a key
variable in the anti-tumor response to immunotherapy, even for tumors outside of the intestine. The goal of this
project is to identify gut bacterial molecules that promote an anti-tumor response to PD-1 blockade and their
mechanisms of action. I hypothesize that certain gut bacterial surface components prime immune cells and
these bacterial-immune interactions within the gut are essential for the anti-tumor immune response to PD-1
blockade at extra-intestinal sites. I propose to test this hypothesis by determining the key immune components
of the microbe-dependent immune response in the tumor (Aim 1), the key bacterial molecules which promote
the anti-tumor response (Aim 2), and the mechanisms by which microbes and immune cells interact within the
gut (Aim 3). These studies are significant because by identifying active, anti-tumor gut bacterial molecules and
mechanisms, more effective therapeutics can be developed that will broaden the range of patients who
respond to checkpoint therapy.
 My long-term goal is to run a research group that investigates the interactions between gut bacteria and
the immune system. My motivation is to identify new bacterial molecules and their mechanisms of action that
can be harnessed in the clinic as therapeutics for cancer and other diseases. I trained in Dennis Kasper’s lab
gaining expertise in gnotobiotic mouse work, microbiota analysis and culture, click chemistry, and bacterial
molecule separation leading to the preliminary data for Aims 1-3. To learn about the immune response to PD-1
blockade and co-signaling molecules, I collaborated with Arlene Sharpe’s lab and obtained preliminary data for
Aims 1-3. This collaboration has led to two patent applications and discussions with industry for drug
translation. To understand how bacteria directly interact with gut cells, I developed a mouse microfluidic gut
chip in a collaboration with Donald Ingber’s lab at the Wyss institute at Harvard that I plan to use in Aims 2 and
3. By taking advantage of the excellent work environment at Harvard Medical School, I have acquired a
unique skill set stemming from experience with both the academic research environment and with industry
discussions for clinical translation. This training enables me to run my own research group that will investigate
gut bacterial/immune interactions that can be employed to create novel therapeutics."

Advance care planning (ACP) supports patients in identifying and communicating their preferences for medical
care and is a key component of patient-centered care. The Patient Self Determination Act of 1990 narrowly
defined ACP as documentation of preferences for end-of-life procedures (e.g., resuscitation), resulting in a
focus on advance directive completion. Since then, ACP has evolved to include a focus on preparing patients
and caregivers for communication and decision-making across the illness trajectory, which is better
conceptualized as “Care Planning” (CP) because the process includes both advance and in-the-moment
decisions over the life course. While health systems have invested in CP as a requisite component of patient-
centered care and it is reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wide heterogeneity of
CP implementation and measurement remain, and the perspectives and needs of culturally diverse patients,
caregivers, and interdisciplinary key informants (e.g., nurses, attorneys, chaplains, etc.,) have not been
considered. Unprecedented basic science (NIH Stage Model, Stage 0) is required to map the complexity of the
entire CP process. Implementation science and human factors engineering offer a path towards clarity. This
proposal advances the field of CP and implementation science by leveraging diverse key informant
perspectives and human factors engineering methods to map implementation processes of CP and to identify
meaningful CP outcomes across clinical and community settings and illness trajectories. We will apply the well-
validated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) model to illuminate CP’s complexity.
CFIR domains include CP innovation characteristics (e.g., discussions) that operate in an inner setting (e.g.,
inpatient, outpatient, nursing home, hospice) and outer setting (e.g., policy, faith communities) centered around
culturally and ethnically diverse interdisciplinary key informants (e.g., patients, caregivers, healthcare
professionals, community leaders, legal/policy experts) involving a range of implementation components (e.g.,
initiating, facilitating, documenting, storing, accessing, updating CP wishes). This complexity is amplified by
patients’ illness trajectories, healthcare access, and unique and differing cultural backgrounds. Our study aims
are to: 1) Define processes of CP for varying settings (community, outpatient, acute care, long-term care,
hospice), illness trajectories (healthy/chronic illness, serious illness, end-of-life), and healthcare access (rural,
public, under-resourced) by creating CP Workflow Archetypes; and 2) Identify patient/caregiver centered and
implementation outcomes for each component of the CP Workflow Archetypes. Using CFIR and human factors
engineering we will map essential implementation factors of CP through focus groups and interviews and use
Delphi methods to identify meaningful patient/caregiver centered outcomes and implementation outcomes. Our
long-term goal is to set the direction for future CP policy, research, and implementation and to decrease health
disparities in CP and medical care during serious illness and at the end of life."

 Osteoarthritis (OA) affects the entire joint. There is growing evidence that cartilage
catabolism and synovial inflammation are interdependent and act as primary drivers of OA. In
this competitive renewal, we build upon our findings in the first funding period, and explore the
central hypothesis that cartilage and synovium are key therapeutic targets for the protective
effect of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) loss-of-function (LOF) against OA.
 Important discoveries made during the first funding period defined completely novel
targets in the pathogenesis of OA and significantly advanced the field. We discovered that DNA
methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) expression is reduced in murine and human OA chondrocytes,
and drives the disease process. In rigorous genetic mouse models, we established that Dnmt3b
LOF (loss-of function) is catabolic in chondrocytes and accelerates OA, whereas Dnmt3b GOF
(gain of function) is anabolic and protects against OA. Integrated analysis of DNA methyl-seq
and RNA-Seq identified Abat as a key downstream target of Dnmt3b. Dnmt3b was found to
methylate the Abat promoter and suppress its expression, while suppression of Dnmt3b
reduced promoter methylation and increased Abat expression, thereby establishing a reciprocal
Dnmtb3b-Abat axis in articular chondrocytes. Using lentiviral approaches, we showed that Abat
over-expression is catabolic and accelerates OA, while Abat suppression is anabolic and
protects against OA. Vigabatrin, a small-molecule inhibitor of Abat, also blocked the
development of OA and synovial inflammation in mice with knee injury. To i) definitively
establish the Dnmt3b-Abat axis in vivo in cartilage; and ii) determine if Abat LOF protects
against OA by acting on cartilage and/or synovium, we created innovative conditional Abat GOF
and LOF mice. Specific Aim 1 will use conditional Abat GOF/LOF in combination with Dnmt3b
GOF/LOF mouse models to determine whether Abat is the key downstream mediator of Dnmt3b
in regulating cartilage homeostasis. Specific Aim 2 will use tissue specific conditional gene
deletions in cartilage (Aim 2A), in synovial fibroblasts (Aim 2B), and in synovial myeloid cells
(Aim 2C) to determine if the protective effect of Abat LOF against OA is dependent on both
cartilage and synovium. Specific Aim 3 will determine whether siAbat gene therapy using a
peptide nanoparticle delivery platform confers protection against OA in mice. These findings will
definitively show that Abat is the key signal downstream of Dnmt3b, define the relative role of
Abat on cartilage and synovium in protection against OA and pain, and establish delivery of
siAbat nanoparticles as a novel translational approach for the treatment of OA and joint pain."

The mevalonate pathway enzymes produce precursors of sterols and isoprenoids, essential metabolites for cell
signaling and membrane biogenesis. As such, cells employ complex transcriptional, translational, and post-
translational processes to regulate mevalonate production. Specifically, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)
tightly controls the mevalonate enzymes on the ER membrane, converging on the ER-associated degradation
pathway. Importantly, increased levels of distinct sterol metabolites in the ER membrane cause proteolysis of
specific enzymes, suggesting that the rate-liming enzyme in the mevalonate pathway can change based on the
stimuli. While studies have focused on the feedback regulation of the mevalonate pathway enzymes upon sterol
stimulation, it is unclear whether other environmental changes, such as cell growth signaling or nutrient
availability, can also tightly control the mevalonate synthesis through post-translational mechanisms. Here, we
report that HMG-CoA Synthase1 (HMGCS1), the first committed enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is the
primary responder of the master regulator of cell growth, mTORC1, among ~20 mevalonate/cholesterol
enzymes. Our quantitative degradomics data indicate that HMGCS1 is stable for several days in cells with active
mTORC1 while substantially degraded within 5 hours of mTOR inhibition. We have determined the E3 ligase
that is solely responsible for the degradation of HMGCS1. Reversing the stabilization of HMGCS1, by a targeted
proteolysis approach, significantly inhibited the anchorage-dependent and independent cell proliferation in
HMGCS1 copy-number-dependent manner. Altogether, our study suggests that HMGCS1 is an
underappreciated, first gatekeeper of the mevalonate pathway flux and that the mTORC1-UPS-HMGCS1 axis
dynamically controls the initiation of mevalonate production to meet the cellular metabolic demand. This pathway
is distinct from the ER-associated degradation of HMGCR and Squalene monooxygenase (SQLE), which
respond to cellular sterol levels."
10882869,"Over 11,000 infants are diagnosed annually with cerebral palsy (CP) with lifetime medical costs >$1.4
million/person. Elevated muscle tone includes dystonia (involuntary muscular contraction) and spasticity
(velocity-dependent muscle stiffness), which often co-exist, greatly impairing function, mobility, and quality of
life and causing pain and bony deformities. After decades of research, dystonia remains poorly understood and
managed. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) delivered continuously via an implanted pump is widely used to manage
dystonic CP despite equivocal efficacy data and very low evidence supporting ITB use. Co-morbid spasticity is
a major confounder that can mask dystonia; further, multiple patterns of brain malformation/injury cause
dystonia and most studies fail to address dystonia triggers, e.g., pain. A 2023 study, however, found that
despite limited dystonia reduction, ITB improved caregiving ease, pain, comfort, and mobility. This revised
proposal specifically seeks to overcome these identified serious limitations of prior studies and thoroughly
investigate ITB’s effects using an adequately powered, prospective observational cohort design. This clinical
trial will use a standardized titration protocol to optimize ITB dosing. We hypothesize that children with more
severe baseline dystonia, spasticity, and pain, as well as those with white matter brain injury patterns, will
show the best overall response to ITB.
AIM 1) Determine the 12-month effects of ITB on a cohort of 65 clinically representative, ITB naïve, children
with dystonic CP using a standardized titration protocol and a battery of assessments to capture critical
components of the child’s function and well-being.
AIM 2) Complete a detailed characterization of brain malformation and injury patterns in children with dystonic
CP. This will be the first study to combine multiple imaging analysis techniques in this population, including the
MRI classification scale for CP, lesion network mapping, and tract based spatial statistics.
AIM 3) Explore potential differences in outcome patterns as related to patient characteristics and use findings
to guide the development of a highly sensitive multidimensional or composite measure that captures clinically
important areas of change for the child and family.
This revised study builds on new preliminary data and capitalizes on the expertise of an established
transdisciplinary team, a high-resource academic clinical environment, and a diverse Parent-Patient Council.
The study’s findings are likely to have high impact to improve future treatment of children with dystonic CP,
including identifying key patient characteristics associated with more or less positive outcomes and developing
a sensitive, efficient multidimensional composite measure to assess treatment responsiveness."

outstanding sophomore, junior, and senior level undergraduate students from UTA (each year) to participate in
a “laboratory-based” summer research education experience. Second, our selection committee will identify up
to 40 underrepresented minority sophomore, junior, and senior level undergraduate students to participate in a
“classroom only” summer research education experience. Each cohort will participate in a 10-week summer
research / educational program, beginning the first week of June each year. Students in the “laboratory-based”
cohort will be assigned a primary faculty mentor who will supervise them in conducting fulltime research related
activities Monday through Thursday. On Friday’s, both cohorts come together for a joint “classroom-based”
research education experience, covering a wide range of topics related to biomedical research ranging from
Professional Development to the Responsible Conduct of Research. Students will also engage with URM faculty
and graduate students every Friday through a series of research seminars. The primary outcomes / metrics of
success will include: 1) Returning to the program for more than one summer experience (particularly for the
classroom-based cohort who will be strongly encouraged to reapply the following year for the laboratory-based
experience). 2) Successful completion of an undergraduate degree in a STEM field. 3) Applying for competitive
fellowships for graduate school or other advanced degrees. 4) Enrollment in an advanced degree program in a
STEM field. And 5) Subsequent participation in research or employment in a STEM field."

 Internalizing problems are common, harmful, and sharply increasing amongst adolescent girls –
creating a public health imperative to identify mechanisms as well as markers of risk or resilience, spanning
from biology to behavior. It is also essential to identify for whom these issues will be adolescent-limited versus
indicative of persistent or worsening mental health, and understand the reasons why. Core biological and
social processes of adolescence, such as puberty, brain development, and peer relationships, are promising
targets. Socially, building and strengthening close friendships and romantic relationships are central
developmental tasks in mid-to-late adolescence. The quality of close peer relationships in mid-to-late
adolescent girls is known to have bidirectional and nuanced associations with emergence and recurrence of
depression, anxiety, and self-harm. Interrogating this dual nature of close relationships, across timescales from
days to years, is critical to begin addressing the emerging mental health crisis in adolescent girls. Furthermore,
it is necessary to also account for the extended influence of pubertal processes, as puberty itself is strongly
implicated in adolescent girls’ mental health. Ongoing maturation of sex hormones as well as brain structure,
function, and connectivity through late adolescence makes it vital to integrate the contribution of developmental
change in these biological factors to social processes and internalizing problems. The Transitions in Adolescent
Girls (TAG) study, launched in 2015 (R01/R56 MH107418), was designed as a comprehensive multilevel
investigation of the connections between biological and social changes during early-to-mid adolescence, as
mechanisms of risk for the emergence of depression, anxiety, and self-harm. We enrolled a community sample
of N=174 girls (initial ages 10-13 years) into a longitudinal study, with three waves of data collected every 18
months, including two laboratory visits at each wave. The first phase of the TAG study focused on early-to-mid
adolescent mental health, as shaped by pubertal, neural, and social development (self-perception and social
cognition). We propose to collect three additional waves of data, approximately 18 months apart, extending the
cohort’s age range to 21 years. This new phase of the TAG study will have a developmentally-appropriate
multilevel emphasis on close peer relationships, assessed via established questionnaires, daily self-reports,
and novel paradigms that tap into intimate self-disclosure behavior and brain function. It will conduct innovative
analyses to relate daily positive and negative experiences in close friendships and romantic relationships, with
changes in well-being. Finally, it will continue to deeply phenotype ongoing biological (neural, hormonal, and
pubertal) changes, and relate these to antecedent and subsequent social processes and mental health. We
propose that close relationship quality and neurodevelopment during mid-to-late adolescence is not only
predictive of concurrent and near-future mental health, but also part of a cascading series of developmental
and risk processes that are set into motion by earlier biological and psychosocial changes."
10882916,"Biomedical research often involves the collection of error-prone, complex, high-dimensional functional and scalar
data. Functional data analysts typically treat functional data as smooth latent curves obtained at discrete time
intervals and regard the error terms as homoscedastic and independent random noise, ignoring potential serial
correlations. Although measurement error attenuates coefficients in classical regression, the impacts of
heteroscedastic, error-prone functional covariates and the combination of error-prone functional and scalar
covariates in survival models, censored quantile regression, and joint models of censored and uncensored data
remain unknown. Failing to account for measurement error and serial correlations in functional covariates in
linear regression leads to severely biased estimates, influencing conclusions drawn from such models. Although
researchers have worked extensively to correct for error-prone scalar covariates in survival models, they have
not addressed measurement error in complex, high-dimensional functional data and the mixture of errors in
combined scalar and functional data in survival and censored quantile regression models. We will develop novel
approaches to survival analysis using Bayesian and frequentist frameworks to address the complexities
introduced by measurement errors in longitudinal, high-dimensional, device-based physical activity (PA) and
self-reported dietary intake (DI) data. Current wearable devices monitor PA objectively, but generate complex
data with poorly understood, heteroscedastic, and systematic errors. Also, researchers often assess DI with self-
reports, which are prone to recall bias and variations in seasonal and day-to-day intake. We will build and
evaluate new models with data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)
Study, a biracial cohort of adults aged 45 years or older (n=30,239). All models will correct for error in device-
measured PA and self-reported DI. We will pursue three aims. Aim 1: Develop latent group semiparametric
models for survival time correcting for measurement error in DI and PA. Aim 2: Develop model-based
approaches to correct for measurement error in PA and DI data and determine the relationships of error-
corrected PA and DI data with joint quantile functions of censored survival time. Aim 3: Develop models to
estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of T2D on survival time after correcting for measurement error in
PA and DI in the presence of endogeneity and potential asymmetric dependency. Our models will inform
personalized recommendations for PA and DI and address health disparities in vulnerable populations. We will
make public use software that implements our models and allows other researchers to apply our methods in
diverse biomedical settings."
10884189,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Across the past five decades, data creation investments in the U.S. and Western Europe have spurred
dramatic breakthroughs in the social and behavioral sciences. The creation of large scientific studies of human
behavior and social experience in the general population form a crucial cornerstone of these investments.
Because the data from these studies are so important for the construction and evaluation of public policies and
programs to improve the health and wellbeing of the population, NICHD places a high scientific priority on
research educational tools that significantly expand the scientific use of such data. The primary limitation of
these research education efforts thus far is an exclusive focus on data from the U.S. population. This greatly
restricts the ability to test the external validity of key findings, raising the possibility that even within the U.S.
population findings from any particular study population may not apply to important sub-populations. Research
education on data resources from populations living under circumstances quite different from the U.S. and
Western Europe are urgently needed so that social and behavioral scientists can quickly and easily test the
breadth of external validity of key findings as well as to advance understanding of these different populations.
 We will leverage NICHD's long-term investment in the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) in Nepal to
achieve this high priority objective. We will implement a series of educational, research tool construction, and
continuing education activities designed to significantly increase the quality and quantity of international
population science. The CVFS is an excellent international population science training resource, featuring a
24-year whole-family panel study with many important characteristics. These include dynamic measures of
child health, contraceptive use, mental health, and community context with both DNA and migrant interviews
for all family members. We will use this special resource to launch a new multimedia educational program
focused on international population science. The program will feature an integrated set of topical short courses,
web-based access to those courses, education on high priority longitudinal research tools, innovative “always
available” learning tools, and archived tutorials. The importance of international population research continues
to grow as interconnections across populations increase. Dynamics of migration, commerce, digital media use,
and violent conflict all increase the need for thorough scientific understanding of population dynamics in far-
away settings. Our program will supply training in international population research skills to enable higher
quality and quantity of research. The tools can be applied to advance science using repeated cross-sectional
surveys, surveillance data, longitudinal panel studies, or random control trial studies. Our educational program
will feature illustrations with the NICHD Population Dynamics Branch's (PDB) highest scientific priorities:
studying contraceptive use and non-use, health across the life course, and the role of genetic factors."
10882802,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antibiotics are the most prescribed medication in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Antibiotic stewardship
efforts have reduced overall antibiotic use in the NICU, but preterm and low birth weight infants have not
benefited proportionately. Preterm infants (≤35 week gestation) constitute ~45% of all NICU admissions, are
admitted for extended periods, are frequently exposed to antibiotics, are at higher risk for antibiotic side effects
and serve as reservoirs for multi-drug resistant pathogens. Thus, interventions to optimize antibiotic use in
preterm infants can reduce unit-level selection pressure and improve patient safety. Despite recommendations
from the American Academy of Pediatrics against its empirical use in the NICU, vancomycin is the most
common antibiotic administered to preterm infants after 3 days of age, largely as empiric therapy for suspected
late-onset sepsis (LOS). Studies by us and others demonstrate that use of vancomycin reducing protocols
(VRP), designed to encourage the use of narrower spectrum antibiotics as first-line empiric and provide
guidance for when vancomycin is an appropriate choice, can safely reduce vancomycin use in the NICU. Yet
these regimens are not universally adopted, and when adopted are not universally applied, highlighting the
need for more comprehensive strategies to implement change. Our long-term goal is to identify and promote
practices that optimize antibiotic use in neonates. Our broad objective is to implement a VRP in NICUs for safe
and sustained reduction of unnecessary vancomycin use in preterm infants (≤35 weeks). We hypothesize that
VRP implemented by preparing local champions, educational outreach, introduction of a clinical decision
support tool and providing unit-level audit and feedback will reduce vancomycin use (Aim 1); and that the use
of additional external facilitation will improve fidelity and acceptability of VRP use (Aim 2). We used the
updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to design this study and simultaneously
use CFIR constructs to understand barriers and facilitators of VRP use (Aim 3). We will comprehensively
examine antibiotic use in the context of VRP implementation including evaluation of implementation outcomes,
disparity drivers, and parent and clinician perspectives. We will conduct this study in 13 NICUs across two
large healthcare networks. Our specific aims are 1) To reduce unnecessary vancomycin use in preterm
infants by implementing a VRP in a quasi-experimental trial; 2) To determine the effect of external
facilitation on the fidelity of using VRP and other implementation outcomes in a cluster randomized
trial; and 3) To identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the VRP across NICUs. By using an
implementation science approach to reduce vancomycin in a multicenter study we will provide a road map for
the broader implementation of VRP across NICUs in the United States. Additionally, our study will provide key
insights into the factors influencing prescribing behavior in the NICU that can inform future antibiotic
stewardship efforts in this high-risk setting."
10880920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with dysarthria due to Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently present with reduced intelligibility, which can
have significant consequences, including reduced participation in situations involving communicating with others
and resulting in social isolation.1–5 Few effective treatments exist to ease the intelligibility burden of dysarthria in
PD, and most require significant cognitive and physical effort on the part of the speaker to achieve and maintain
gains.6,7 Once people with PD have progressed beyond the early stages of the disease, and their cognitive and
physical impairments limit their ability to use traditional speech therapy techniques, they are not realistic
treatment candidates for current interventions; and no other interventions are available to support their
communication. This is a serious and consequential gap in clinical care for people with PD. The current proposal
addresses this critical gap by shifting the weight of behavioral change from the speaker to the listener, specifically
key communication partners such as family. Indeed, for older adults, most of their time spent with others is spent
with family members.8 Further, key partners of patients with PD wish to have a more significant and active role
in communication rehabilitation.9,10 A listener-targeted remediation approach for intelligibility impairments in
people with dysarthria and PD is firmly grounded in theoretical models of perceptual learning11–13 and rigorously
supported by our decade-long research program targeting perceptual learning of dysarthric speech.14–30 To date,
this line of investigation has chiefly targeted the theory of listener adaptation to the degraded signal; however,
robust intelligibility improvements of up to 20 percent across studies have been observed.15 With a rigorous
account of how and what listeners adapt to, we are ideally positioned to move this work from bench to
bedside, establishing listener (i.e., perceptual) training as a clinical intervention to improve intelligibility
in people with PD. Here, we establish the efficacy of listener training for patients with PD and their primary
communication partners using a repeated-measures, randomized controlled trial (SA1). Immediate acquisition
and retention of intelligibility improvements will be examined as a function of speaker severity. We then evaluate
three theoretically and empirically-motivated communication benefits of listener training that extend beyond
intelligibility, including listening effort, comprehension, and communicative participation (SA2). Finally, we
engage stakeholder input to inform clinical implementation of listener training using qualitative semi-structured
interviews (SA3) with patients with PD and their partners. This will provide insights into the effectiveness and
feasibility of the intervention approach, ensuring that their needs and preferences are considered and that they
feel empowered and motivated for a listener training approach. Thus, in three independent aims, this proposal
will address a current void in our clinical toolbox, establishing a new realm of clinical practice in which
communication challenges in PD are managed by training partners to better understand the degraded speech."

Currently there is no successful treatment that restores damaged brain circuitry. Neuron loss by either
neurodegenerative diseases or trauma causes neurological and cognitive dysfunction, posing a great burden for
human health. There is a critical need to find strategies for neural circuit repair. Direct reprogramming
approaches hold great promise for brain repair. Their success in functional circuit restoration will depend on their
capacity to convert other cells into neurons with functions matching those of the neurons damaged in a circuit.
This precise conversion has been observed in the mouse cerebral cortex between cortical output (corticofugal)
neurons, which can acquire the connectivity properties, including long-range projections, typical of other
corticofugal subtypes. Though this is a promising step forward toward circuit repair, this precise conversion has
been observed when reprogramming is induced at embryonic or immature states.
The mechanisms that preclude reprogramming in differentiated neurons or the mechanisms that keep neuron
identity unchanged throughout life are not understood. Hence, our goal is to investigate mechanisms critical for
maintaining neuron subtype identity in differentiated neurons and determine how they limit reprogramming over
time. This will reveal barriers that preclude functional conversion between neuron subtypes in vivo. We propose
to investigate these mechanisms in corticofugal neurons, specifically in the context of in vivo reprogramming of
Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) to produce Subcerebral projection neurons (SCn), a clinically relevant neuron
subtype that degenerates in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and whose axons are damaged by spinal cord injury.
In this proposal we will investigate whether identity maintenance mechanisms can be manipulated for in vivo
reprogramming of CTn into functional SCn (Aim 1), we will determine whether these mechanisms can be
inactivated in mature CTn to eliminate barriers that preclude CTn conversion into SCn (Aim 2), and we will
elucidate the underlying downstream signals that preclude conversion of CTn into SCn in vivo (Aim 3)."

The Hematology T32 Training Grant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) remains
committed to training both MD physician-scientists and postdoctoral PhD scientists for careers in academic
hematology and hematology research. With 5 positions, the program will continue to train the most
promising clinical fellows, primarily from adult and pediatric hematology, as well as PhD post-doctoral
candidates in areas of traditional institutional research strength that encompass benign hematology. These
areas of focus are 1. hemostasis/thrombosis/platelet biology; 2. sickle cell disease/hemoglobinopathies; and 3.
transfusion medicine. Both basic bench and clinical research tracks are offered, with carefully selected
didactic coursework to complement the training experience. All trainees will complete instruction in scientific rigor
and reproducibility, basic biostatistics, and grants writing and scientific presentation. Additional didactic instruction will be
individualized for trainees, with bench researchers receiving formalized training in techniques and concepts that are
most relevant to their research focus. Trainees with a primary emphasis in clinical research will be expected to carry a
heavier course load unless they have previously obtained a Masters in Clinical Research or equivalent qualification.
Those without this background will be encouraged to pursue an MSCR degree in the Gillings School of Public Health.
The research mission of the recently created ‘UNC Blood Research Center’ encompasses precisely the same areas of
focus in non-malignant hematology under a new organizational structure that enhances the opportunities for training
and team science. In this competitive renewal, scientific and educational interactions between MD and PhD
trainees in the form of conferences, journal clubs, and symposia have been emphasized. Following 2 years
of training on the T32 grant, trainees will be encouraged to apply for individual or institutional K series
awards, and/or other sources of independent research funding."

10876449,"Preterm infants are at high risk for both transfusions and iron deficiency, both of which may independently
contribute to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. On average, infants less than 1000 gm require 4 to 5 blood
transfusions during their initial hospitalization. Darbepoetin (Darbe) can increase the number of infants who
remain transfusion-free, and for those who do require transfusions, can decrease the number of transfusions,
cumulative volume of blood transfused, and unique donor exposures. However, the use of Darbe increases iron
utilization, and treated infants may become progressively iron deficient with oral iron supplementation alone.
When iron supply does not meet the iron demand of the rapidly expanding RBC mass, first iron stores in the liver
and then non-storage iron in other tissues (including brain) will be compromised. This is of particular concern for
preterm infants since iron is required for normal brain development, including such processes as myelination,
dendritogenesis, production and degradation of neurotransmitters, and to sustain the brain’s high metabolic rate.
Thus, iron deficiency during fetal and early postnatal months can result in irreversible neurodevelopmental
abnormalities despite later iron repletion. Our overarching goal is to develop a therapeutic pathway to minimize
transfusions while maintaining iron sufficiency, thereby optimizing developmental outcomes. We hypothesize
that combined treatment of infants < 32 completed weeks of gestation with Darbe plus one of two slow-release
intravenous (IV) iron preparations, ferumoxytol (FMX) or low molecular weight iron dextran (LMW-ID) will 1) be
safe, 2) decrease or eliminate transfusions, 3) increase hematocrit, 4) maintain iron sufficiency, and 5) improve
neurodevelopment. We further hypothesize that when compared to oral iron supplementation (standard care),
IV iron will be better tolerated, with less effect on the gut microbiome. An advantage of using these slow-release
IV iron preparations is that fewer, higher doses of iron are needed to prevent or treat iron deficiency. For example,
an anemic iron deficient pregnant woman can be treated with a single dose of 1000 mg IV compared to 5 IV
doses of iron sucrose. Because FMX and LMW-ID have not been tested in neonates, in Aim 1 we will compare
these two drugs and evaluate total dosage needed to maintain iron sufficiency while being treated with Darbe.
Starting doses will be 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, repeated as needed to maintain ferritin >75 mcg/L. In Aim 2 we
will compare the safety, efficacy and tolerance of the combined approach of using Darbe + IV iron (N=80) with
standard care (oral iron supplements up to 12 mg/kg/day, N=40). Evaluation will include safety, gastrointestinal
tolerance, and efficacy. The effect of oral compared to IV iron on the microbiome will be evaluated. The primary
outcome will be hematocrit, transfusion burden and iron status at hospital discharge. In Aim 3, the long-term
neurodevelopmental outcome of the 3 groups (Darbe + FMX, Darbe + LMW-ID, oral iron only) will be evaluated
up to 2 years of age. We anticipate demonstrating the feasibility and potential benefit of Darbe plus slow-release
IV iron to decrease transfusions, maintain iron sufficiency and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Background: Sexual dysfunction (SD) is estimated to occur in up to 50% of childhood cancer survivors (CCS)
and has important implications for quality of life and mental health. Effective management of SD in AYA-CCS is
substantially limited due to lack of screening and detection of SD in cancer survivorship settings. Adolescent and
young adult-aged CCS (AYA-CCS) may be particularly vulnerable to SD and its under-recognition due to
developmental challenges. This study addresses this critical barrier and serves as the first step in progressing
toward the long-term goal of improving health-related quality of life in AYA CCS through improved screening,
recognition and treatment of SD among CCS. Candidate: The proposed award will enable the candidate, Dr.
Sopfe, to develop the skills necessary to progress toward her career as an independent researcher leading high
quality pragmatic trials. Training: Specifically, Dr. Sopfe will gain experience in Dissemination & Implementation
(D&I) science, pragmatic clinical trials, and mixed methods, which will propel her toward a research career aimed
at developing and disseminating interventions to improve quality of life for CCS. In addition to experiential training
through the research plan, Dr. Sopfe will benefit from a multidisciplinary mentorship team: Primary Mentor, Dr.
Peterson (hybrid trials, qualitative research, patient-reported outcomes); Co-Mentor, Dr. Chow (pediatric cancer
survivorship, clinical trials); and Methods Mentor, Dr. Studts (D&I, mixed methods). Dr. Sopfe’s training plan
includes formal didactic coursework, workshops, and career development programs. Research Plan: This
proposal’s overall objective is to use patient and provider stakeholder input to refine and test an approach to SD
screening for AYA CCS in a clinic setting. Informed by D&I frameworks, this research proposal will used mixed
methods and iterative testing and modification to refine an SD screening approach (Aim 1). This approach will
be then tested in a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study (Aims 2 and 3), employing mixed
methods to assess patient and provider outcomes. Environment: The environment for this project is exceptional
with a strong academic Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT at the University of Colorado, the
resources of the University of Colorado Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery
Science (ACCORDS) (D&I Science Program, Qualitative & Mixed Methods Research Core). The clinical trial will
occur through the 1) Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO) HOPE Survivorship Program; CHCO Neuro-Oncology
group; and 3) Seattle Children’s Hospital Cancer Survivorship Program. This multiclinic design will ensure
successful recruitment as well as increase generalizability of findings. Impact: The proposed study will serve as
a necessary first step in improving screening, detection, and treatment of SD in AYA-CCS; future work will include
establishing broader effectiveness our screening approach through a multicenter randomized trial, as well as
development, testing, and dissemination of multidisciplinary interventions for SD in this population."

Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and the development of successful treatment
strategies requires an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that result in diversity of cancer
cell dynamics and interactions with the tissue environment. Quantitative imaging is a powerful
tool for understanding these cellular mechanisms. New quantitative imaging methods, including
light sheet microscopy, super-resolution microscopy and machine learning approaches to
biological image analysis, have enabled previously impossible experiments. Proper training in
the fundamental principles of quantitative imaging is essential to generating reliable data,
correctly interpreting experiments, and enhancing the reproducibility of cancer research. The
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue the course “Quantitative Imaging: From
Acquisition to Analysis”, to be held in the spring of 2021-2025. This two-week intensive course
provides students with a thorough foundation in state-of-the-art quantitative light microscopy
and image analysis techniques. The course is designed to engage a multidisciplinary audience,
including biologists, physicists, engineers and computer scientists at all career stages, from
graduate student to Principal Investigator. A unique aspect of this course is its strong emphasis
on generating accurate and precise quantitative imaging data. A typical day of the course
includes didactic lectures, a research seminar, a group discussion session and focused
quantitative imaging laboratory exercises. The exercises include both image acquisition and
analysis, and are planned such that, over the duration of the course, the most common types of
quantitative measurements used in cancer research are covered, including: co-localization,
measurement of fluorescence intensities, live specimen imaging,3D-image analysis, and
detection/tracking/counting of diffraction-limited objects, subcellular structures, and whole cells.
Students learn to use a wide range of imaging modalities to complete the exercises, including
widefield fluorescence, point-scanning and spinning disk confocal, total internal reflection
fluorescence, light sheet and super-resolution microscopy. A suite of computers equipped with
free open-source software are used to process data and make measurements using modern
image analysis methods, including machine learning approaches. In the daily group discussion,
students present and discuss their results with the course instructors, thereby developing
expertise in assessing the quality of quantitative measurements and critical troubleshooting
skills. The instructors are internationally recognized leaders in quantitative microscopy and
computational image analysis, and invited seminar speakers provide examples of expert use of
quantitative imaging to answer biological questions. Quantitative Imaging: From Acquisition to
Analysis provides training in quantitative microscopy that is crucial for advancing the mission of
the NCI."

deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world and is a known source of executive dysfunction
during the vulnerable windows of early childhood and adolescence. However, despite its prevalence and
impact, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. This proposal focuses on a
potentially critical but under-explored mechanism linking iron deficiency to transdiagnostic executive
dysfunction: brain iron deficiency. Aim 1 will define how brain iron deficiency during adolescence mediates the
effect of peripheral iron deficiency on executive dysfunction. We will first investigate this relationship in a large
community-based sample (n=9,500 with peripheral iron and cognitive assessment, n=1,601 with neuroimaging)
and then replicate and extend the model to a sample that is enriched for individuals with psychiatric disorders.
Aim 2 will use a prospectively collected sample of adolescents with and without a history of iron deficiency in
routine screenings at 9-18monts of age to determine how iron deficiency across childhood and adolescence
impacts brain iron deficiency and executive dysfunction in adolescence. Critically, this aim will inform a multi-hit
model whereby iron deficiency across childhood and adolescence will be associated with greater brain iron
deficiency and thus more severe executive function than having iron deficiency in only one of the two time
periods. Finally, Aim 3 will examine how sex differences in peripheral iron deficiency impact sex differences in
brain iron after the onset of puberty. Together, these aims will identify both the timing of vulnerability and the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying executive dysfunction, thus informing translational models for targeted
treatments and interventions. The support of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award will provide the
applicant with the training necessary to achieve these aims, including training in developmental
neuropsychiatry, cognitive assessment, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and advanced biostatistics.
These training objectives will be accomplished with the support of an outstanding mentorship team, Drs.
Satterthwaite, Gur, Witschey, Shinohara, Wehrli, and Georgieff, and the world class technical and intellectual
resources of the University of Pennsylvania. Together, the proposed scientific aims and training objectives will
form the foundation for an independent research program aimed at uncovering the neurodevelopmental
mechanisms for executive dysfunction in youth with mental illness."
10879029,"The University of Rochester's Department of Neurology has a long and productive history of training post- residency physicians and other post-doctoral clinical neuroscientists to be leaders in the Experimental Therapeutics of Neurological Disease (ETND Training Program). There has never been a more exciting time to translate neuroscience discoveries into clinical trials and clinical care. Translating these advances into improved clinical care for patients requires a cadre of specialty-trained clinician neuroscientists who are responsive to the increasing pace of scientific discoveries, the growing burden of neurological disease, as well as to the emerging suite of approaches and techniques to accelerate therapeutic development. The 2-3 years integrated ETND Training Program, now in its 29th year, has responded to this global challenge in several ways. We will expand our world-class roster of Program Faculty (from 18 to 38) to include 26 “Established” Mentors and 12 “Emerging” Mentors, to provide a rich and diverse training environment across the increasingly subspecialized fields within neurology. In addition, we will appoint a Lead Biostatistician to serve on the Executive Committee, expand the number of biostatistician mentors (from 2 to 5), and strengthen the scientific rigor of training. We will develop a competency-based curriculum covering core didactics in experimental therapeutics, which is customized to the individual needs and goals of each trainee. We will develop an “advanced topics” curriculum (novel study designs, emerging statistical issues, innovations in outcome measurement, novel recruitment approaches, and emerging ethical topics) that will be integrated through program-wide meetings, including Working Group in Clinical Research, a Mellow Fellows seminar and a new program faculty and alumni-funded Annual Lectureship in Experimental Therapeutics. These activities will enhance the trainee's quantitative literacy/mindset when developing their research projects. Training will occur in a structured environment with a 3-4 members mentor team (including an Established and Biostatistical Mentor) and guided by a Research Career Development Plan. Mentorship will be provided for research projects (pilot studies, secondary data analyses, and collaborative studies), peer-reviewed publications, oral presentation skills, grant preparation (structured internal grant review and feedback mechanism), and career guidance. In this application, support is sought for 4 post-residency trainees per year with 2-4 new trainees accepted into the program annually. Recruitment and career development plans focus on diversity including women, the disabled and underrepresented minorities by developing a diverse and inclusive environment, targeted outreach, and feedback from a Diversity External Advisory Committee. The training program infrastructure is also utilized by trainees supported by other funding sources, so that a class of 6-12 fellows are training at any given time. This program will train the next generation of independently funded leaders in the experimental therapeutics of neurological disease who will transform the research landscape and accelerate therapeutic development for patients and families."

Demand for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in biomedical research has increased tremendously over
the past five years, as they have emerged as a critical biomedical model system in a variety of study disciplines.
The increased use of marmosets has been most acute in neuroscience, where the need to study cognition,
behavior, and mental illness in primate models has grown. Among non-human primate (NHP) models, the
marmoset provides unique practical advantages for neuroscientific studies, including small size, easy handling,
rapid reproductive maturation, high fecundity, compressed life cycle, and social behaviors and communication
that more closely resemble those observed in humans. These advantages have also contributed to the recent
surge in the demand for marmosets in studies using embryonic new genomic editing techniques. This recent
upsurge in demand has resulted in shortages in availability of marmosets estimated to be in the range of 2000
marmosets needed by the overall research community each year, with our own estimate in the range of a 200-
animal shortfall for the neuroscience community alone. The Southwest National Primate Research Center
(SNPRC) and the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) propose a major collaborative effort
to dramatically increase the availability of healthy common marmosets for national neuroscience research
projects. In response to the upsurge in demand for marmosets in neuroscience-related projects, the SNPRC and
WNPRC propose a comprehensive plan to 1) double their output of marmosets for provision to national
institutions in need of these experimental animals for neuroscience research, 2) continue to ensure the highest
standards of husbandry and veterinary care and thus, the excellent health of these colonies, 3) maintain pedigree
records and develop genomic databases to document and maximize genetic diversity among the expanded
marmoset colonies, 4) continue collaboration between the two Centers in new studies focused on improving
husbandry, breeding, and veterinary practices to maximize the health and lifespan of these animals, and 5)
communicate on a regular basis with the U24 Marmoset Colony Coordination Center, and with the NIH
Marmosets for Neuroscience Steering Committee. The collaborative approach proposed by the two NPRCs is
both innovative and appropriate given the resources and expertise available and ensures successful completion
of these aims resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of marmosets available to the neuroscience
community."

This K43 appplication is being submitted to provide the environment for me to achieve my goal to become an
independent physician/scientist investigator and a leader in the study of HIV clinical pharmacology and
pharmacogenomics. To continue my progress towards this goal, I have developed a comprehenisive K43
mentored research training program that includes a a longitudinal clincal research project with nested
pharmacokinetic drug interaction and pharmacogenomic studies that are based on a hypothesis that combining
fluoxetine with dolutegravir-based combination HIV antiviral treatment will increase the plasma concentration of
dolutegravir and toxicity. This drug interaction may result in poor medication adherence, suboptimal treatment of
depression and inadequate viral suppression. I will investigate this hypothesis during my research project utilizing
well-designed pharmacokinetic studies of fluoxetine and dolutegravir in people living with HIV (PLWH) with major
depression in Nigeria. Depression is a common comorbidity and the most common neuropsychiatric disorder
among PLWH. My long-term career research goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with
HIV/AIDS through the optimization of dosing regimens in PLWH in low-medium income countries.
My initial training has allowed me to make progress in developing clinical research skills. However, there are
four important areas that I will emphasize during the K43 award period including; (1) Design, conduct, monitoring
and management of a clinical trial, (2) Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modeling, (3)
Pharmacogenomics, and (4) Advanced statistical methods.
The specific aims of the K43 research plan are:
1. To determine the pharmacologic factors that contribute to the safety and effectiveness of fluoxetine among
depressed PLWH treated with dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy.
 2. To determine the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and fluoxetine in adult PLWH with depression.
3. To determine the impact of pharmacogenomics on pharmacokinetics and clinical responses focusing on
polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes and transporters including UGT1A1, SLC22A2, ABCG2, CYP2D6 and
CYP3A4.

10879041,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are a ubiquitously expressed, essential class of enzymes responsible for
ligating amino acids to cognate tRNA molecules. Importantly, 34 of the 37 loci encoding an ARS have been
implicated in myriad dominant and recessive clinical phenotypes, making these enzymes a major contributor to
human inherited disease. It is now important to systematically assess the role of ARS alleles in human disease
phenotypes and to determine how they affect protein translation. These data will provide insight into the
molecular pathology of disease-associated ARS alleles, which affect a wide range of tissues. Furthermore,
defining the molecular mechanisms of ARS-associated disease will allow rapid patient diagnosis through
distinguishing pathogenic from non-pathogenic alleles in human populations. We and others have shown that
disease-associated ARS alleles cause a loss-of-function effect on tRNA charging. However, a number of
critical questions remain, including: What is the full spectrum of disease phenotypes caused by ARS alleles?
What is the subset of ARS alleles in human populations that are pathogenic? How do loss-of-function
missense ARS variants cause dominant peripheral neuropathy? and How do loss-of-function ARS variants
affect mRNA processing and protein expression? Here, we employ multiple established and complementary
model systems—computational, biochemical, cellular, yeast, worm, and mouse—to address the above
questions. Our efforts will include: (1) studying patient populations to implicate newly identified ARS variants in
disease onset; (2) deeply interrogating ARS-related phenotypes using worm and mouse models; (3)
systematically determining the effect of ARS variants on gene function using massively parallel mutagenesis
and mammalian cell viability assays; (4) testing neuropathy-associated ARS variants for both dominant-
negative and toxic gain-of-function effects in vitro and in vivo; and (5) testing loss-of-function, disease-
associated ARS variants for an effect on protein translation via ribosomal profiling and mass spectrometry in
yeast, worm, and mouse models. In sum, the areas of study outlined in this proposal will dramatically improve
our understanding of how certain ARS alleles give rise to dominant and recessive human disease phenotypes."
10879044,"Significance: This proposal is for a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to test an intervention and
implementation strategy of a peer-delivered, stepped care approach for integrating HIV and substance use
(SU) services in a resource-limited primary care setting. Globally, a SU treatment gap exists, with only 1-4% of
individuals who need treatment in the most resource-limited contexts receiving minimally adequate treatment.
Given the impact of untreated SU on poor HIV outcomes along the care continuum, efforts are needed to
sustainably integrate behavioral interventions into primary care settings to reach individuals at highest risk for
poor ART adherence and SU outcomes. This gap in care in resource-limited settings will be met through
implementing a peer-delivered, stepped care intervention, which has been successfully piloted in Cape Town,
South Africa in the PI’s K23 award (“Khanya”). Preliminary work: Our team has developed and adapted the
Khanya peer-delivered intervention based on key stakeholder feedback to improve ART adherence among
PLWH with SU in primary care in South Africa. Khanya integrates Life-Steps, a single-session problem solving
and motivational intervention for ART adherence, with brief behavioral skills to reduce SU (i.e., behavioral
activation, mindfulness, relapse prevention). The PI’s K23 award included a pilot Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial that demonstrated initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of Khanya
for improving ART adherence compared to enhanced standard of care (ESOC). At post-treatment, adherence
in Khanya was M=60.3% days vs. M=26.5% in ESOC. Methods: Guided by RE-AIM, the current study aims to
test in a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial the effectiveness and implementation of a stepped-
care Khanya intervention for PLWH at highest risk for ongoing ART nonadherence and HIV transmission. A
stepped care approach is appealing in a resource-limited context, as the least resource intensive part of an
intervention is delivered first, and only individuals who do not respond receive the more resource intensive part
of the intervention. 150 PLWH with SU will be recruited from an integrated primary care site and randomized to
ESOC (i.e., facilitated referral to public SU treatment) or Khanya. Khanya begins with Life-Steps + ESOC, and
only those who continue to demonstrate ART nonadherence (i.e., detected using real-time electronic
adherence monitoring; ≥3 missed doses in a 2-week period) will step up to receive the full intervention. Based
on our pilot data, we anticipate Life-Steps + ESOC alone will be sufficient for ~44% of patients to overcome
barriers to ART adherence, but the other ~56%, particularly those with more severe SU, will require the full
intervention. Participants will be followed for 12 months on: ART adherence (Wisepill, DBS concentrations, and
self-report), SU (urinalysis, PEth, and self-report), implementation (reach and uptake, fidelity, adoption), and
economic impact. The overall aim is to test a feasible, sustainable, and effective peer-delivered approach to
improve ART adherence among PLWH with SU in resource-constrained primary care settings."

Strong evidence implicates the sympathetic nervous system as a key regulator of peripheral vascular tone and
blood pressure during hypoxia. Herein, we present striking sex-differences in the neurovascular response to
hypoxia that challenge current dogma. Our results are corroborated by epidemiological data showing sex
disparities in the prevalence of hypertension and progression of cardiovascular disease in conditions of
hypoxemia (i.e., sleep apnea). However, contributing mechanisms remain a critically unanswered question. The
present study will fill this gap in knowledge while also determining whether these mechanisms are impaired with
obesity. Nearly 70% of the US population is overweight or obese, with the prevalence of obesity even greater in
patients with sleep apnea. Obese adults exhibit greater sympathetic nervous system activity and higher risk for
hypertension than normal weight adults. Emerging data indicate the impact of obesity on cardiovascular health
is disproportionate in women versus men and it is reasonable to propose this is exaggerated with the addition of
hypoxic stress. The purpose of this application is to examine key mechanisms contributing to sex-differences
in hypoxic vasodilation and the impact of obesity, with particular emphasis on the sympathetic nervous system.
Our central hypothesis is that young premenopausal, normal weight women are protected from the sympathetic
vasoconstrictor effects of hypoxia, and the “beneficial” effect of female sex is lost with obesity. Based on strong
preliminary data, we anticipate α-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction is exaggerated and β-adrenergic and
downstream nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation are attenuated during hypoxia in obese women. We will test our
central hypothesis via the following specific aims: The first aim of this project will determine sex differences in
α-adrenergic receptor mediated vasoconstriction during acute hypoxia as well as the impact of obesity. We
propose a comprehensive approach of intra-arterial drug infusions of α-adrenergic agonists and antagonists,
combined with direct measures of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in normal weight men, normal weight
women, and obese women. The second aim of this project will determine the direct and modulatory effect of
the β-adrenergic receptors on hypoxic vasodilation as well as the impact of obesity. We will collect human arterial
endothelial cells and measure the peripheral vascular response to hypoxia prior to and following intra-arterial
infusion of select β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. This experimental approach will allow us to strategically
assess β-adrenergic receptor activity, sensitivity, and expression in the context of hypoxia as well as down-
stream mechanisms. Our proposed findings will advance the fundamental, mechanistic understanding of hypoxic
vascular control in women, and results will ultimately guide the development of new strategies to treat and
prevent vascular pathophysiology in sleep apnea and other conditions of hypoxia."

 How visual information is processed and transformed in the nervous system is a fundamental question in
vision research. Given its clear importance in visually guided behaviors and the available tools, the mouse
superior colliculus holds great promise for understanding visual processing and its neural mechanisms. The
superior colliculus is a midbrain structure important for multimodal integration and sensorimotor transformation,
with its superficial layers receiving direct inputs from the retina. This proposal aims to study how different types
of neurons in the superficial superior colliculus (sSC) process visual information, especially in response to more
complicated and naturalistic stimuli. Aim 1 is to confirm that cerebellin 4 positive (Cbln4+) neurons are inhibitory
and direction selective and to characterize their morphology and synaptic connectivity. The activity of Cbln4+
neurons will then be manipulated to test the hypothesis that inhibitory neural circuits in the sSC mediate
contextual modulation in visual motion processing. Aim 2 is to reveal how sSC neurons respond to visual stimuli
in a virtual reality environment, with a focus on excitatory and inhibitory direction selective neurons and the wide
field vertical neurons which project to the pulvinar thalamic nucleus. Their responses will be studied using in vivo
2-photon Ca2+ imaging and compared between the “closed-loop” (where the animal’s running speed controls the
flow of visual scenes) and “open-loop” (where the visual flow is uncoupled from the animal’s locomotion)
configurations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that there is a cell-type-specific encoding of self-
generated visual flow in the sSC. Aim 3 is to determine whether there are neurons in the sSC that signal the
animal’s own locomotion. These non-visual neurons will be fully characterized, and their molecular identity
revealed. Finally, physiological recording will be performed to determine whether the sSC displays a depth-
specific and location-dependent organization in encoding the animal’s own locomotion and comparing between
predicted optic flow and actual visual motion. Together, these experiments will generate important data needed
for a complete understanding of visual processing in the brain. Because normal visual processing is
compromised in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as dyslexia, schizophrenia, and autism
spectrum disorders, the proposed studies will provide novel insights for the understanding and treatment of these
disorders."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes progressive cognitive decline and death.
The AD pathological hallmarks are extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing
aggregated Tau protein. The US FDA recently approved aducanumab to promote Aβ plaque clearance, and
antibody-mediated removal of Tau aggregates has also moved to phase II clinical trials. Despite the potential
therapeutic impact of antibodies in AD, our understanding of natural B cell responses in AD remains limited. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that meningeal B cells of young adult mice are not blood-borne as in aging mice,
but rather derive from B cell progenitors that migrate from the skull bone marrow into the meninges and are
selected by CNS antigens. Based on this premise, Aim1 will test the hypothesis that the BCR repertoire of ABand
Tau-specific B cells, the affinity of the antibodies produced, and the T cell help in mouse models of Aβ
plaques and tauopathy depend on the lymphopoietic niche in which they develop. Meningeal B cells derived
from skull bone marrow and selected by Aβ and Tau should generate low affinity antibodies. Conversely, B cells
that develop in the periphery, not selected in the CNS, should be strongly activated by Aβ and Tau, receive T
cell help, and generate high affinity antibodies. Antibodies of different origins will be further tested for the ability
to clear Aβ and Tau from the brain. Active Aβ immunization to induce antibody-mediated clearance of Aβ plaques
has been tested in a human trial of active immunotherapy, but was discontinued because of aseptic
meningoencephalitis in some cases. In this trial, Aβ peptide was injected subcutaneously together with the QS-
21 adjuvant that strongly augments T cell responses to vaccine antigens. Based on our preliminary data, Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that delivery of Aβ and Tau directly to the meninges and/or with the mild B cell selective
adjuvant CpG-B will elicit anti-Aβ and Tau antibodies that clear plaques without inducing strong CNS
autoimmunity. Several studies have reported that AD associates with changes in function and cytokine secretion
of T cells. Our preliminary data delineates an antigen-experienced population of CD8 T cells with potent effector
functions and the ability to secrete proinflammatory cytokines in the blood of AD patients, as well as clonal
expansion in the CSF. Aim 3 will test the hypotheses that clonally expanding T cells are Aβ and/or Tau specific
and have distinct transcriptional and phenotypic programs in AD patients versus controls; furthermore, these T
cells correlate with clinical parameters. We will determine whether the BCR repertoires of Aβ- and Tau-specific
B clonal expansions found in blood and CSF of AD patients and healthy controls are different and correlate with
AD pathology and cognition defects. We will use innovative immunophenotyping combined with single cell TCR,
BCR-, and RNA-seq methods. Results will lay the groundwork to understand anti-Aβ and anti-Tau T and B cell
responses in mouse models and AD patients, which will help stratify patients before offering Aβ/Tau-based
immunotherapy."

This will allow us to offer enhanced training for scholars at all three training levels, and also to emphasize cross-level mentoring in order to facilitate young scientists' development as leaders and trainers in Neuroscience. To enhance the undergraduate Neuroscience pipeline, we will provide research experiences, aid in articulating career goals, and facilitate graduate school preparation for our underrepresented (UR) students pursuing Neuroscience majors in the College. To support UR graduate students' and postdocs' academic and career pathways, we will provide professional skill development training, career exploration and networking opportunities to aid academic career success. Finally, we will foster a continuity of Mentorship across all career stages by introducing good mentoring practices for the trainees and their faculty mentors, pairing NESSTP trainees across stages to engage in near-peer mentoring, and establishing a pan-Neuroscience Mentoring Committee to establish good mentoring practices and promote a diverse and inclusive Neuroscience training community at the University of Chicago."

The goal of this proposal is to dissect the mechanisms of self-DNA detection by the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP
synthase (cGAS), and to determine the relative contribution of its diverse signaling activities to inflammation in
the microenvironment of implantable murine tumors. cGAS operates in virtually all cell types as a DNA sensory
protein, which synthesizes the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) upon binding DNA. This second
messenger stimulates interferon (IFN) and inflammatory activities via the downstream protein STING. Because
cGAS detects the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA, a major question relates to how this enzyme is regulated
to ensure self-nonself discrimination. This question relates to much fundamental biology and the answer will
impact the increasing number of clinical endeavors that target the cGAS-STING pathway. The cGAS-STING
pathway is oft-discussed in the context of antitumor immunity, but the activities of this pathway that are beneficial
(or not) to immunity remain unclear. For example, inflammatory activities induced by cGAS-STING in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) have been reported to induce protective inflammatory and cytolytic CD8+ T cells. But
cGAS-STING signaling events have also been reported to promote tumor growth and disease progression. A
central idea that drives our work is that the ubiquitous presence of the cGAS-STING pathway in most cell types,
along with its diverse signaling effectors (cGAMP, IFNs, cytokines), can create a complex TME prone to
unpredictable outcomes (e.g. disease resolution or progression). In order to understand each activity of this
pathway, new experimental tools are needed to disentangle its effector functions. Herein, we describe new
synthetic biology-based genetic circuits that can dissect the effector functions of cGAS-STING, within cancer
cells specifically. Notably, these systems led to the discovery of specifies-specific differences in the ability of
primate and murine cGAS proteins to detect self-DNA. This finding raises questions of the suitability of mice
and certain primates as accurate preclinical models for cGAS-STING function, and provide a mandate to define
the mechanisms and consequences of cGAS-mediated self-DNA activities. The work in this proposal is based
on the hypothesis that the cGAMP, IFNs and cytokines induced by the cGAS-STING pathway play differential
roles in tissue inflammation and immunity, and that understanding the role of each of these activities, within
specific cell types, requires a detailed characterization of the mechanisms of self (and nonself) DNA detection.
To address this hypothesis, we propose to determine how distinct intra-tumoral cGAS activities influence
protective T cell immunity (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we propose to determine mechanisms of self-DNA reactivity by
human cGAS through comparative analysis of the human, mouse, chimpanzee and orangutan proteins, each of
which display distinct means of self-DNA reactivity."
10886046,"Abstract
Our overall goal is to determine a potential causal link between L1, an active retrotransposon element, in
human brain cells and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). L1s are involved in numerous human diseases with different
molecular and cellular mechanisms. L1 expression was also found to be upregulated in AD postmortem human
tissues, leading to the speculation that L1s could contribute, at least partially, to the mechanisms leading to AD
in humans. However, despite all these correlations, there is no experimental-based causal link between L1s
and AD so far. Here, we hypothesized that L1 expression in AD-derived brain cells can contribute to AD
pathology, using both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Accumulation of L1-derived
ssDNA molecules in the cytoplasm of glial cells might be responsible for a chronic low-level stimulation of the
immune system, aka “sterile” inflammation, and can aggravate molecular and cellular phenotypes in neurons
derived from AD patients. Moreover, a cell autonomous mechanism, triggered by L1 ssDNA accumulation in
neurons could accelerate and exacerbate molecular and cellular phenotypes related to AD pathogenesis.
Thus, the combinatory impact of L1 expression in the different cell types could causally contribute to AD. To
experimentally test this hypothesis, we will use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from controls and AD to
overexpress L1 ssDNA molecules and analyze their impact on different neuronal types individually or in
combination using a brain organoid model system. The use of iPSC-derived cells and organoid model is
perfectly suited as we can isolate the aging effect and capture the entire genome of AD individuals in relevant
cell types. We have designed the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: Determine the impact
of L1 retrotransposons in AD-derived astrocytes. We will measure alterations in transcriptomics,
cytokines/interferon release levels and interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) expression in AD/isogenic-derived
astrocytes upon L1 ssDNA overexpression. We will also evaluate neurotoxicity using astrocyte conditioned
media from AD-derived astrocytes overexpressing L1 ssDNA. Aim 2: Determine the impact of L1
retrotransposons in AD-derived cortical neurons. We will measure Tau aggregation and phosphorylation,
and synaptic loss, all early hallmarks of the AD progression. Aim 3: To model AD progression with a brain
organoid model. We will use our optimized protocol to generate brain cortical organoids (BCO) infused with
human microglia from AD- and control individuals. BCO with L1 ssDNA but treated with nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as a protective agent, will be compared. Our proposal aims to demonstrate an
eventual causal contribution of L1-derived ssDNA to molecular, cellular and network phenotypes in brain cells
and organoids derived from AD individuals. Our data will reveal unexplored pathways with immediate
therapeutic relevance that could lead to transformative treatments for AD and other aging-related syndromes."

This research will focus on the identification of the biomarkers associated with various diseases and the
development and validation of an innovative high-resolution ion mobility (IM) device. The proposed device is
based on a new variant of Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM) and will couple high-resolution ion
mobility separations achieved by traveling wave (TW)-SLIM with drift tube (DT)-SLIM which is a novel approach
that can provide collision cross section (CCS) values of the separated isomers/conformers that are unique to the
target biomarkers of interest. We expect this capability to increase biomarkers’ identification accuracy. In
addition, by combining the attributes of the high-resolution ion mobility and ambient ionization, sensitive
detection, and superior separation power will be achieved in the analysis of complex clinical samples without
any prior sample preparation.
The current diagnosis methods are often slow, expensive, or laborious which limits their use in resource-limited
regions. Therefore, there is a strong unmet need for new technologies that can rapidly diagnose various diseases
to complement the existing commercially available technologies. Rapid identification of diagnostic biomarkers in
clinical samples will not only lead to an increase in recovery rates but also will lead to shorter hospitalization
stays and reduced antibiotic resistance. We aim to develop a portable IM diagnostic device that can be used for
the identification of the biomarkers associated with foodborne and Alzheimer’s diseases which significantly
impact the lives of millions of people. The significance of these diseases causes diagnostic tests to play a major
role in the clinical care of patients suffering from these diseases Our studies will enable high throughput analyses
that are affordable and so easy-to-operate that can be performed by less-skilled users, such as nurses and their
assistants. Over the long term, these studies will be extended to multiple applications that span from the
fundamental studies of molecular structure elucidation to advanced analytical applications such as a widely
usable point-of-care diagnostic device that can serve the community, especially resource-limited regions.

10886060,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most frequent hematologic malignancy, and is divided into B-cell and T-
cell lymphoma subtypes. B-cell NHL patient outcomes have improved dramatically with the development of
new targeted therapies, but similar progress has not been made against peripheral T-cell (PTCL) and
cutaneous T-cell (CTCL) lymphomas. Indeed, patients who relapse after initial PTCL therapy have a less than
1 year median survival, and patients with the CTCL subtype mycosis fungoides that is advanced, or that has
Sézary syndrome with skin, blood, and lymph node disease, have a median survival of one year from
diagnosis. Thus, the identification of novel targets and drugs with activity against PTCL and CTCL will be
critical for this area of unmet medical need to help cure these diseases, which have not been a major focus for
industry-sponsored research due to their heterogeneity and lower incidence. To address this challenge, we
investigated the cell surface proteome of PTCL and CTCL cell lines and found Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
to be highly expressed. Then, we developed monoclonal antibodies to human HSP70 and found that one,
designated clone 239-87, recognized HSP70 on PTCL and CTCL cells but not on normal T-cells. To convert
239-87 into a drug, we linked it to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to generate an antibody-drug conjugate
(ADC), which we found inhibited PTCL and CTCL cell line growth as well as and, in some cases, better than
brentuximab vedotin (BV), another ADC already approved for T-cell NHL. Also, 239-87-MMAE showed
synergy when combined with other therapies already used against PTCL and CTCL, including the deacetylase
inhibitor vorinostat and the ADC BV. Next, we used the 239-87 single chain variable fragment sequence to
create chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) guided T-cells, and these were activated in the presence of T-cell NHL
cell lines. Finally, in a cell line-based xenograft, the 239-87-MMAE ADC cured mice with an aggressive PTCL
variant. Our preliminary data support the central hypothesis that targeting cell surface HSP70 using an ADC or
CAR T-cell therapy approach will be both novel and effective against PTCL and CTCL, and could ultimately
improve patient outcomes. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: (1) To investigate the
differential expression of HSP70 in PTCL and CTCL models, including in primary patient samples, and
to perform studies to identify pathways in these cancer cells that regulate HSP70 expression; (2) To
identify the best ADC and CAR T-cell construct based on our 239-87 antibody, and explore which
combinations will show greatest synergy; and (3) To use in vivo models, including patient-derived
xenografts, to determine effective strategies against these lymphomas that will work best in the
clinic. Taken together, successful completion of these studies will increase our understanding of the role of
HSP70 in PTCL and CTCL biology, provide the rationale to take these approaches to the clinic for patients with
PTCL and CTCL who are looking for novel therapies and, ultimately, improve their outcomes."
10886061,"Congenital lymphedema is caused by inherited gene mutations that impair the functioning of the lymphatic
vasculature and lead to swelling of the limbs, disfigurement, cellulitis, and increased susceptibility to MRSA
infections of the skin and sepsis. Congenital lymphedema is also a comorbidity of lymphatic malformations and
other common syndromes (e.g. Noonan). The most common gene mutation that causes congenital
lymphedema is a heterozygous inactivating mutation in the VEGFR3 gene that causes Milroy’s disease. While
VEGFR3 has been widely studied as the main receptor that induces lymphangiogenesis, virtually nothing is
known about how VEGFR3 regulates physiological functions of the lymphatic vasculature. Thus, the
pathogenesis of Milroy’s disease remains unknown, prohibiting the development of drug therapies. Patients
with congenital mutations in VEGFR3 have lower leg lymphedema and upon lymphoscintigraphy imaging it is
revealed that their lymphatic vessels are unable to absorb any tracer from the interstitium. Here, we have
developed a mouse model in which the VEGFR3 gene can be deleted specifically from the lymphatic
vasculature to understand its physiological functions. Our preliminary data show that loss of VEGFR3
negatively affects the ability of lymphatic capillaries to remodel their continuous cell-cell junctions, reminiscent
of zippers, into discontinuous wide-open junctions called buttons. Junctional remodeling in the lymphatic
capillaries is a relatively new biological process that is poorly understood but relies on the adherens junction
protein, VE-cadherin, in which our laboratory has expertise. Importantly, the button junctions are thought to
enable fluid absorption from the interstitium. Our preliminary data identify VEGFR3 as a novel regulator of
lymphatic capillary junction remodeling to form button junctions. We will combine this mouse model with cell
culture and physiological approaches to investigate the role of VEGFR3 in the lymphatic vasculature in the
following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will assess the ability of lymphatic capillaries to remodel their junctions in
the absence of VEGFR3 at various timepoints after birth. We will also investigate whether VEGFR3 is required
not only for button junction formation, but also for the lifelong maintenance of these special junctions. Lymph
flow will be assessed in vivo to determine how the loss of button junctions affects physiological interstitial fluid
absorption. In Aim 2, we will investigate the downstream cell signals that regulate button junction formation and
identify the signaling pathways involved using a variety of approaches. The completion of these aims will
identify a new signaling pathway by which VEGFR3 controls lymphatic junction remodeling to enable interstitial
fluid absorption by the lymphatic capillaries. This work will significantly impact patients with congenital
lymphedema by providing mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease, opening the door to
developing pharmacological treatments."
10885919,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision-
making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable
humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal
is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the
mammalian brain.
 Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded
in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment.
The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for
two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central
hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory
evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative
psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of
confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats
invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a
behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual
decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and
learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine
if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using
inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and
test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without
perceptual confidence.
 These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information
about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is
innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence
in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical
logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments
in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive-
compulsive and psychotic disorders."

 The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how chronic alcohol intake modulates the liver-to-brain
axis to induce and/or promote Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Studies have largely focused on the direct
action of alcohol on the brain and studies looking outside the brain to understand how alcohol modulates AD
pathology are lacking. Our exciting preliminary data have identified two potential alcohol-induced changes to the
liver that could induce and/or promote AD pathology in the brain. First, we have discovered that chronic alcohol
feeding reduces hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LRP1), a receptor essential in removing peripheral
amyloid-beta (Aβ). Since peripheral Aβ can be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and become deposited in the brain, it is conceivable that altered LRP1-
mediated hepatic Aβ clearance can significantly affect brain Aβ load. Second, our work shows that peripheral
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secreted by the liver and other organs during alcohol-induced injury can greatly
impact the BBB and AD pathology. In AD transgenic mice, peripheral TNF-α blockage by the TNFR-Fc fusion
protein (etanercept) reduces AD pathology, and our exciting preliminary data shows enhanced Aβ(1-42)
migration across the brain endothelium due to TNF-α-mediated increase in BBB-permeability in vitro. This
proposal will explore these novel findings to provide an integrated examination of how alcohol intake may alter
the liver-to-brain axis to induce and/or promote AD pathology. The proposal has two specific aims: 1) Delineate
the effect of alcohol on Aβ clearance by the liver and examine its impact on peripheral-to-central Aβ homeostasis.
Our working hypothesis is that alcohol intake alters hepatic peripheral Aβ clearance through LRP1
downregulation to increase peripheral-to-central Aβ load. 2) Characterize the effect of alcoholic-liver-injury-
induced peripheral inflammation on neurovascular- and neuronal-degeneration, and its impact on AD pathology.
Our working hypothesis is that alcoholic-liver-injury-induced peripheral inflammation causes BBB dysfunction,
increases AD hallmark pathology (Aβ and tau-tangles), and modulates neuroinflammation, thereby inducing
and/or potentiating AD pathology. The proposal will combine specialists in the areas of liver/alcohol research
with those in AD/BBB research to provide a comprehensive exploration of the liver-to-brain axis utilizing state-
of-the-art in vivo and in vitro techniques and models, which will increase synergy and likelihood of success. The
resulting new knowledge will enable the identification of new therapeutic-targets and provide mechanistic insight
into alcohol-dependent AD, and will delineate the importance of the liver-to-brain axis in AD pathology, an
unexplored concept in the emerging field of alcohol-dependent AD."

 The Doctoral Training Program in Alcohol-Related Health Services Research at the Heller School at
Brandeis University prepares students to become scholars in alcohol-related health services research for
teaching and research careers in universities, government agencies, research organizations and major service
delivery systems. It has been an integral part of the Ph.D. in Social Policy program at the Heller School since
its beginning in 1994. We focus on how organization, management, financing and payment make a difference
in the effective delivery of prevention, treatment and recovery services for alcohol problems. We specifically
focus on how these factors intersect with how disparate and vulnerable populations face unique barriers to
these services. In this competitive renewal, which requests nine predoctoral training slots for the next five-
year cycle, the successful leadership and program structure and content of the current multi-disciplinary
training program is maintained. We include an explicit plan to enhance the diversity of the applicant pool.
Typically, three new students enter the program each year and are supported for three years.
 The educational goals of the training program function at the intersection of three domains: theory,
applied research, and policy. A rigorous multi-disciplinary education that includes several alcohol courses in
the behavioral health concentration, intensive discipline-based mentoring to guide trainees as they develop
and conduct dissertations that incorporate alcohol topics, and hands-on alcohol-related research experience
combine to provide these trainees with the skills and knowledge needed to be successful alcohol-related
health services researchers. The doctoral program at the Heller School constitutes the foundation of the
educational program of the alcohol-related services research training program, which is housed in the
behavioral health concentration. It adds the specialization in services research and policy analysis in the field
of alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. It is sequenced to provide broad substantive knowledge regarding
the evolution of and current issues in major policy areas relevant to alcohol use disorders, advanced training in
the principles of research design and statistical reasoning, experience in the conduct of applied research, and
directed study through the dissertation on a topic related to alcohol services. Collaborations with local research
organizations and universities expand research opportunities.
 We are committed to recruiting a diverse pool of trainees who have real-world experience in a variety of
settings, who bring a depth and breadth of knowledge to the Heller School experience and to research and
social policy analysis, and who are able to link their research foundation with real-world service delivery. The
progress and commitment of the current and former trainees of the Heller Doctoral Training Program in
Alcohol-Related Health Services Research provide evidence for success."

It is well established that African Americans have higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors than whites and
are less likely to achieve hypertension and diabetes control. The neighborhood environment is a critical
structural determinant of these disparities given the disproportionate exposure of African Americans to
deleterious residential environments. In light of this, we propose using the JHS, a state of the art epidemiologic
cohort of African Americans (n=5,306), combined with rigorously assessed neighborhood contextual factors to
examine longitudinal associations between features of the physical, social, and local healthcare environment
and cardiometabolic risk factor development and management over a 20-year period. Understanding the role
of changing neighborhood environments in shaping cardiometabolic risk factor development and management
is critical to improving causal inferences and developing appropriate policies and interventions designed to
mitigate the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in this high-risk population. Furthermore, understanding
these changes in the unique context of the South, a region of the country with the highest burden of chronic
disease and urban areas characterized by high proportions of African Americans, low population density, and
geographically dispersed amenities, will allow us to better understand how neighborhood processes operate in
this setting and better tailor ongoing prevention efforts. The primary goals of the proposed study are to: 1)
compile a multilevel database of time-varying neighborhood contextual data (i.e. physical, social, and
healthcare characteristics) that can be linked to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS)— a unique, state-of-the art
cohort study of African Americans and 2) to examine longitudinal associations of changes in neighborhood
contextual factors with HTN and DBM development and management. Aim 1 will examine longitudinal
associations between time-varying physical and social neighborhood features and cardiometabolic risk factors
among African American adults. Aim 2 will examine longitudinal associations between time-varying
neighborhood physical and social features and HTN and DBM control. Aim 3 will examine associations
between local access to primary care and cardiometabolic risk factor development and management and
whether features of the physical and social environment modify associations. This project will build upon
detailed neighborhood data collection from Exams 1-3, incorporate emerging neighborhood data collection
techniques, and take advantage of the collaborative partnership established between the Drexel University
Dornsife School of Public Health and the JHS through the Center for Integrative Approaches to Health

10885929,"Background: Among ambulatory individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), residual balance deficits
are common and are a primary factor limiting participation in walking activities. There is broad recognition that
effective evidence-based interventions are needed to enhance dynamic balance following iSCI. However,
improving dynamic balance after iSCI has proven to be very challenging. Experimental interventions that amplify
self-generated movements (e.g. error augmentation) may accelerate motor learning by intensifying sensory-
motor feedback and facilitating exploration of alternative motor control strategies. These features may be
beneficial for retraining dynamic balance after iSCI. We have developed a cable-driven robot to create a
movement amplification environment during treadmill walking by applying a continuous viscous force field to the
pelvis that is proportional in magnitude to a participant’s real-time COM velocity. Our purpose is to investigate if
locomotor training performed in a movement amplification environment can effectively improve dynamic balance
and increase participation in walking activities of individuals with iSCI.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate if locomotor training performed in a movement amplification environment is
effective for improving dynamic balance of individuals with iSCI.
 Our pilot data found that following locomotor training performed in a movement amplification environment
three individuals with iSCI each improved dynamic balance by more than 30%. These improvements were
accompanied by faster over ground walking speeds and improved reactive balance. Thus, we hypothesize that
improvements in dynamic balance during walking will be greater when locomotor training is performed in a
movement amplification environment when compared to locomotor training performed in a traditional treadmill
environment.
 Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of locomotor training performed in either a movement amplification environment
or in a traditional treadmill environment on participation in walking activities.
 Based on evidence identifying a strong relationship between balance and steps per day in ambulatory
individuals with iSCI, we hypothesize that training in the movement amplification environment will positively
impact dynamic balance, and in turn increase participating in walking activities.
Approach: We will conduct a two-arm parallel-assignment intervention. We will enroll 36 ambulatory participants
with chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injury. Participants will be randomized into either a Control group
receiving locomotor training or an Experimental group receiving locomotor training performed in a movement
amplification environment. All participants will receive 20 training sessions. We will assess changes in dynamic
balance using measures that span the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
framework including; 1) clinical outcome measures of gait, balance, and quality of life, 2) biomechanical
assessments of the capacity to control COM motion during walking, and 3) data collected from activity monitors
to quantify changes in participation in walking activities as evaluated by number of steps taken per day.
Impact: Training dynamic balance of individuals with iSCI by amplifying their own self-generated center of mass
motion during walking is a radical departure from current practice and may create effective new clinical strategies
for addressing balance impairments of individuals with iSCI. Successful outcomes from the proposed trial would
motivate development of clinically-feasible tools to first replicate and then to evaluate the movement amplification
environment within the VA’s clinical care settings. Knowledge gained from this study will expand our
understanding of how individuals with iSCI learn dynamic balance and how targeted dynamic balance training
impacts participation in walking activities."

Fetal weight estimation, or the assessment of antenatal fetal weight for the purposes of growth tracking and
labor planning, is a critical component of safe prenatal care. Estimations currently rely on ultrasound-derived
measurements of specific fetal planes to indirectly assess growth and wellbeing. The standard fetal biometric
measurements for the estimation of fetal weight (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal
circumference and femur length) are poorly correlated to actual fetal weight, defined as the measurement of
newborn weight in grams at birth. For newborns who are above 4,000 grams at birth, current error estimates of
fetal weight in the late-third trimester of pregnancy are only accurate approximately 40% of the time. By no
longer relying on fetal biometric measurements, data science approaches have the potential to estimate fetal
weight with lower bias and errors compared to standard regression methods. To date, no studies have used
ultrasound images, not just the fetal measurements, as input into a neural network approach to estimate fetal
weight. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the skills and training necessary to lead the
advancement of data science for use in clinical assessment during pregnancy. Using existing ultrasound
imaging and birth certificate data (n=17,478 patients) from the University of Rochester (UR) Medicine Hospitals
and the Finger Lakes Regional Perinatal/Obstetrics Data System (PDS), and n= 310 patients in the R01 study,
Understanding Pregnancy Signals and Infant Development (UPSIDE: R01HD083369), the specific aims are: 1)
To determine the maternal (i.e., body mass index) and fetal factors (i.e., growth measurements) that increase
the discordance between the estimation of fetal weight by the Hadlock formula and actual birth weight of
neonates using birth certificate data from the PDS, 2) To evaluate the accuracy of a CNN algorithm on
ultrasound images in the third trimester to estimate fetal weight compared to the Hadlock formula, and 3) To
test the effectiveness CNN algorithm on new ultrasound images from the UPSIDE study. This proposal will
leverage the expertise of Dr. Caitlin Dreisbach’s mentorship team, computational resources, and the
exceptional research environment at the UR School of Nursing, Goergen Institute for Data Science, and the
Rochester Institute of Technology. Results from this study have the potential to change practice and improve
clinical assessments during the late third trimester of pregnancy. The research study and mentored training
included in this award allows Dr. Dreisbach to establish her long-term career goal of becoming an independent
investigator with expertise in the translation of data science to obstetric clinical care."
10885978,"I. PROJECT SUMMARY: Smartphone-based wound infection risk screener and care
recommender by combining thermal images and photographs using deep learning methods
Chronic wounds, which affect 6.5 million patients in the US12 severely affect their quality of life, can take up to a
year to heal and re-occur in 60-70% of patients. Wounds often get infected (bacteria in wound), resulting in limb
amputations if not treated properly and on time1. In current practice, at the Point of Care (POC) (e.g., nurses
visiting patients’ homes and trauma sites), caregivers who are not wound experts have no way to diagnose
infections. Thus, they cautiously refer wounds suspected to be infected to clinics for debridement of dead tissues,
blood tests and infection diagnoses by experts57-60. However, referrals increase time before infected wounds are
treated, and the chances of limb amputation. Moreover, some referred wounds end up not being infected, wasting
patient and expert time and expenses (e.g., transportation)15-16. What is needed is a digital health solution
that enables non-expert wound caregivers to accurately detect infected wounds at the POC even without
debridement and provide standardized recommendations on evidence-based care and when to refer.
Smartphones equipped with high resolution cameras and the processing power to run machine/deep learning
methods are owned by most wound caregivers in the US56. Prior work by Goyal et al1 reported preliminary results
that show that infection can be detected from visual attributes such as increased redness in/around the wound
in a photograph using deep learning (accuracy 0.727± 0.025, sensitivity 0.709 ± 0.044, specificity 0.744 ± 0.05).
While promising, their results need to be improved and validated before clinical applications. Moreover, their
dataset included already debrided wounds with easily discernable infection cases, and they did not recommend
evidence based best care and decide when referrals to wound clinics were the best course of action.
Certain thermal image patterns are reliable indicators of wound infection20, and some models of smartphones
are now equipped with thermal cameras55. Our hypotheses are that 1) the accuracy of smartphone wound
infection detection can be improved by combining thermal images with photographs jointly analyzed
using a deep learning method 2) recommendations for actionable, evidence-based wound care and when
to refer can be generated using machine learning to standardize care provided by non-experts.
In response to NOT-EB-19-018, we propose research to investigate the capability and accuracy of detecting
infected wounds before debridement using deep learning methods applied to combinations of wound
photographs and thermal images and generating care and referral recommendations. We also propose
integration of the smartphone-based infection screener into our group’s existing wound assessment system7-9,
21-29 and validating it on new patients (N=100). Success on our proposed aims will increase the number and
objectivity of wound infections detected outside the wound clinic and fast-tracked to the clinic for treatment,
reducing the number of patients who require amputations. Our findings will apply to diverse wound types
including diabetic, pressure, arterial, venous, surgical61 and trauma wounds62, which all get infected."

development for early stage faculty. Dr. Barajas will be provided with at least 80% protected research time
making OHSU an ideal setting to carry out this program for transitioning to an independently funded research
career. The long-term scientific objective is to define innovative biomarkers of glioblastoma therapeutic
resistance. Neuroinflammation (pseudoprogression) is a hallmark of effective therapy and prognostic of overall
survival. However, pseudoprogression and recurrent disease appear identical by standard of care gadolinium
enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI). Changes within the hypoxic immune microenvironment may serve as biomarkers of
effective therapy and unique feature of pseudoprogression development. A critically unmet clinical need for
immunotherapeutic response assessment is the ability to monitor the hypoxic immune microenvironment. We
address this significant gap in knowledge by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define glioblastoma immunotherapy-
mediated innate immune activation and tumoricidal efficacy by 11.75T Ferumoxytol (Fe)-MRI, and 2) Determine
if Ferumoxytol-enhancement and hypoxic volume are imaging profiles of glioblastoma immunotherapy-mediated
pseudoprogression or true progression in a clinical trial. Preclinical glioblastoma models (aim 1) and human
clinical trials (aim 2) will be undertaken. The overall hypothesis is that Gd- and Fe-enhanced FMISO PET/MRI
can assess the biological features responsible for immunotherapy efficacy. This translational research and
career development proposal will support a mentored early stage investigator in this area of multidisciplinary
research to directly address the major challenges of developing life prolonging therapeutic approaches for

10885996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Apicomplexan parasites cause persistent mortality and morbidity worldwide through diseases including
malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. The phylum member Toxoplasma gondii alone infects
approximately one third of the world population. T. gondii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious
disease in immunocompromised patients. Most human infections are asymptomatic but immunosuppression
due to organ transplant, cancer chemotherapy, or infection with HIV can lead to re-activation of the infection.
In addition, infection of the fetus during pregnancy causes congenital toxoplasmosis. Some exotic strains of T.
gondii have been described in tropical countries that cause severe ocular disease in immunocompetent
patients. Treatment for toxoplasmosis is challenged by lack of effective drugs to eradicate the chronic infection
and as many as one-third of AIDS patients do not respond to the therapy. Most of the drugs currently used are
poorly distributed to the central nervous system and they trigger allergic reactions in a large number of patients.
There is a compelling need for safe and effective treatments for toxoplasmosis.
 The mitochondrion of T. gondii and of other apicomplexan parasites is critical for replication and several
major antiparasitic drugs, such as atovaquone and endochin-like quinolones, act through inhibition of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain at the coenzyme Q:cytochrome c reductase. The coenzyme Q (UQ)
molecule consists of a water soluble quinone head (para-hydroxybenzoate or PHBA) that can accept or donate
two electrons and a lipophilic isoprenoid tail that confines the UQ to membranes. Synthesis of the PHBA moiety
in plants and yeast occurs through the shikimate pathway, but how it is synthesized in apicomplexan is not
known. The isoprenoid unit derives from a common precursor, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and its
isomer, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are synthesized in mammalian cells via the mevalonate
pathway, but in T. gondii instead is synthesized via an apicoplast localized methylerythritol phosphate (MEP)
pathway. IPP and DMAPP are condensed by the action of a unique farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TgFPPS)
into farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Work from our laboratory
demonstrated that T. gondii is able to salvage GGPP and FPP from the host and therefore intracellular
parasites are vulnerable to inhibition of the host isoprenoid synthesis pathway. In this project we propose to
investigate the synthesis of UQ (downstream to the salvage point) and validate the pathway as a novel target.
Our preliminary data demonstrates the essentiality of three enzymatic steps and the inhibition of one of them
by a novel compound. Our hypothesis is that the synthesis of UQ represents a unique and essential pathway
with enzymatic steps liable to inhibition by specific compounds, some already in use in the clinics and potential
new ones to be discovered. We predict that exploring this pathway will reveal unique and essential enzymes
that could be targeted for improved chemotherapy against T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites."

Pregnant women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy
outcomes, yet the majority of pregnant women with mental health needs do not receive treatment, with
disparities in treatment utilization among low-income and racial and ethnic minority women. Perinatal mental
health treatment gaps are foremost a consequence of behavioral health workforce shortages and a lack of data
on PTSD treatment during pregnancy. Mental health stigma and medical mistrust due to racism further impact
engagement in care. Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is a brief 5-session PTSD treatment that was designed
to address the capacity-limiting concerns of first-line treatments (e.g., time burden of training and delivery).
WET has demonstrated non-inferiority (and fewer dropouts) when compared to first-line PTSD treatments. As
such, the empirical support and implementation advantages of WET suggest the promise of this intervention in
addressing PTSD among pregnant women seen in usual care obstetrics settings. Training non-mental health
specialists, such as community health workers (CHWs), to deliver WET may dually address workforce capacity
challenges and patient engagement factors such as stigma. The objective of this research is to conduct a
randomized controlled trial to examine both the effectiveness of WET for treatment of PTSD during pregnancy
against an active control condition [i.e., emotion focused supportive therapy (EFST)] and the non-inferiority of
WET delivery with a community health worker (CHW-WET) vs. WET delivery with a mental health clinician. A
total of 240 pregnant women with PTSD receiving obstetrical care at Boston Medical Center (BMC), a large
safety net hospital that cares for a racially and ethnically diverse population, will be recruited. Following a
baseline visit, women will be randomized to either CHW-WET (N=80), standard WET (N=80), or EFST (N=80).
Participants in either WET condition will receive 5 individual sessions focused on the use of writing to activate
the trauma memory, process emotions, and make meaning. EFST participants will receive 5 individual
sessions of supportive therapy. Participants will complete well-established measures of PTSD and other
psychological symptoms (e.g., depression) and proposed moderators of treatment engagement at baseline,
post-treatment, and 1-, 6-, and 12-months postpartum. Patients and providers will also complete measures and
interviews following treatment to assess feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the WET delivery
approaches in a usual care setting. Aim 1 is to determine if a) CHW-WET is non-inferior to standard WET and
b) CHW-WET has better retention than standard WET. Aim 2 is to demonstrate the effectiveness of WET for
treatment of PTSD (vs. EFST) in an obstetrics setting. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine moderators of treatment
engagement such as mental health stigma to inform a personalized approach to WET treatment delivery. Aim
4 is to conduct a process evaluation of the WET delivery approaches. This study will inform future efforts to
improve access to and quality of care for treatment of PTSD during pregnancy."

This training program in “Systems-Level Research in Microbial Pathogenesis” will formalize and strengthen
interdisciplinary research in microbial pathogenesis and high-throughput science that interrogates parasites,
fungi, bacteria, and viruses more completely at the systems-level. The University of Maryland Baltimore has
exceptional strength and depth in microbiology, infectious disease, vaccinology, genomics, and bioinformatics
with >100 faculty with research in these areas. The nineteen senior training faculty and seven junior training
faculty are drawn from the world class microbial pathogenesis research programs in the Schools of Medicine,
Dentistry, and Pharmacy; including scientists from two of the university's internationally renowned research
institutes—the Center for Vaccine Development and the Institute for Genome Sciences. These faculty have
>1000 publications in the past ten years and 93 grants with average direct costs of $1,707,495/year. They will
develop and participate in a new graduate course targeting these trainees that is aimed at interdisciplinary
research at the intersection of microbial pathogenesis and systems-level research. Predoctoral trainees will be
selected from two interdepartmental doctoral programs that include a common core curriculum, elective
courses, journal clubs, seminars, annual symposia, and graduate research presentations. The selected
predoctoral students will also include trainees from the School of Medicine MD/PhD program and the School of
Dentistry DDS/PhD program. Academic work will be combined with rigorous mentored research training in the
research groups of the training faculty, who have current and past training grant eligible predoctoral trainees
with an average of 4.0 publications/trainee. Postdoctoral trainees will be selected through recruitment of new
fellows to the University of Maryland Baltimore. Our training grant eligible postdoctoral trainees have been
equally productive with 4.5 publications/trainee. The program is guided by a highly qualified team of three Co-
Directors (MPIs) with two serving as track leaders, as well as an internal Executive Committee. An External
Advisory Committee has also been established that will evaluate the program. Our trainees will be further
focused on systems-level research in microbial pathogenesis through a change in our curriculum, as well as
unique opportunities that will aid in recruitment and development of more students in this area. Programs that
distinguish trainees from the larger pool of graduate students, to promote and enhance their training, include (i)
oral presentations at the annual University of Maryland intercampus Crosstalk symposium, (ii) regular training
program research meetings, (iii) teaching opportunities in graduate and medical courses, (iv) opportunities to
present at national or international conferences, (v) opportunities to present in internal seminar series, (vi)
formalized career mentoring and career-focused networking, and (vii) formal training in mentorship and

to build our robust pipeline for developing diverse scientists."
10887596,"SUMMARY
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data of 2017 revealed that worldwide 291.2 million (11.2%) of 2.6 billion
children and adolescents were estimated to have one of four developmental disabilities (childhood epilepsy,
intellectual disability, and vision loss and hearing loss), which is an increase of more than double since 2004.
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), along with South Asia, hosts the overwhelming majority (94.5%) of these children.
These children, especially in SSA, are severely underrepresented in the relevant literature. The proposed work
is intended to contribute to improving the representation of children and youth from SSA in the scientific
literature. The overarching objective of this work is to identify and characterize children/youth (aged 3-18)
with developmental disabilities (DD) growing up in rural Zambia. The proposed work is structured around three
unique SA. SA1 pertains to the ascertainment of a large sample of children/youth with DD and their matched
siblings (total n = 4,000). SA2 addresses the characterization of this sample of children to identify and classify
the etiology and potential treatment of their DD. SA3 intends to document the services that are currently
accessed by children/youth with DD, and to ascertain community perceptions of DD, to advise on what
services are available, accessed, or needed. Collectively, SA1-3 will generate a unique multi-level (social
context—behavior—brain—genome) dataset presenting a range of manifestations and causal pathways to DD
in rural Zambia in particular and in SSA in general."

MDI Biological Laboratory seeks NIDDK R25 support for the fourteenth through eighteenth annual offerings of a
one-week course for renal fellows, Origins of Renal Physiology. The course will be held August 2023 through
2027 on the MDI Biological Laboratory campus in Bar Harbor, Maine. The proposed course provides renal fellows
with hands-on research education in fundamental concepts of homeostasis and exposes them to the classical
experiments that form the foundation of renal physiology and nephrology.
Eight course modules are proposed: glomerular filtration and genetics of renal disease, proximal tubule function,
thick ascending limb, salt secretion and balance, collecting duct sodium transport/ENaC, water homeostasis,
renal stone disease, and acid/base homeostasis. Each of the eight modules runs in three consecutive two-day
rotations (Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, and Friday-Saturday), with the first day of each rotation
involving intensive experimental work, and the second day involving analysis and presentation of the work to the
entire course group. Each participant will complete three of the eight planned modules during the three rotations.
A case study-based Responsible Conduct in Research program will be included in the schedule for all
participants.
Origins of Renal Physiology is entirely unique among national renal short courses. The course provides
participants with research tools that give them a deeper understanding of concepts of physiological homeostasis
which is difficult to attain during normal clinical training schedules. The course is open to renal fellows and, since
2010, on a space-available basis, medical residents entering nephrology. Fellows and residents alike benefit
from close interactions with senior investigators in renal physiology who lead the course modules. Residents, in
particular, benefit by working with fellows from different programs and sharing their insights into renal research
and nephrology.
The course is described on the MDI Biological Laboratory website, and in a recent editorial in J. Am. Soc. of
Nephrology (Zeidel et al., JASN 19: 649-50, 2008). Requested funds will cover course tuition and participant
travel; faculty subsistence, stipends, and travel; facility user fees; consultant services; and personnel costs
required to administer the research education program."
10884353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Signaling metabolites are small molecules with routine functions in cellular energy metabolism that also
act as signals to regulate diverse cellular pathways in response to a changing energy state. Signaling metabolites
link nutrition to aging. Many of the emerging geroscience therapies that target mechanisms of aging have come
from the discovery and understanding of signaling metabolites. The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a
new signaling metabolite. It is produced during fasting, dietary restriction, exercise, or carbohydrate restriction
to keep the body's tissues supplied with energy when glucose is scarce. We now have growing evidence that it
also functions as a signal, by inhibiting enzymes, binding directly to proteins as a post-translational modification,
and activating receptors. Through its signaling activities, BHB regulates gene expression, inflammation,
metabolism, senescence, and other cellular activities important to both aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
 We recently showed for the first time that ketogenic diet (KD), which stimulates endogenous production
of BHB similar to fasting, improves survival in aging mice and prevents age-related declines in memory. We also
found that KD improves memory in the hAPPJ20 AD mouse model, and reduces abnormal epileptiform
discharges that contribute to memory decline. KD is a complex intervention, and though it is now being studied
in clinical trials of AD, a better understanding of which aspects of KD are most helpful should lead to better
targeted and more effective therapies. We have successfully developed an innovative toolset of dietary,
chemical, and genetic tools to isolate the individual components of KD, including carbohydrate restriction, BHB,
energy provision by BHB, and cellular signaling activities of BHB. We will use these tools to uncover the specific
mechanisms by which BHB improves memory in normal aging and in AD mice (Aim 1), and reduces epileptiform
discharges in AD mice (Aim 2). We will characterize key molecular changes that BHB causes in the proteomic
landscape of the brain, including mapping the acetylome and new BHBylome (Aim 3).
 This project combines expertise in both geroscience and AD with a deep understanding of BHB biology
to carry out closely aligned mechanistic studies using both aging and AD models. It examines the intersection of
a molecular mechanism that is broadly relevant to aging (ketone bodies as metabolic signals) with one highly
specific to AD (aberrant epilepsy-like network hypersynchrony). It is highly likely to stimulate further progress on
AD because the mechanistic framework it generates will directly inform translational studies involving ketone
body compounds and ketogenic diets. These data will help establish criteria for designing effective interventions,
provide relevant intermediate biomarkers, and permit deeper investigation into the downstream molecular targets
most relevant to AD."
10884449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) are inherited aging-associated diseases
that have a devastating impact on patients and family caretakers relative to their prevalence in the general
population. These conditions belong to a family of polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases caused by
mutations resulting in the pathological expansion of trinucleotide (CAGn) repeats in distinct genes. Increases in
CAG repeat length give rise to proteins containing aberrantly expanded polyQ tracts, which interfere with normal
protein function and promote misfolding. Toxicity in these diseases is thought to arise in part from the formation
of pathological inclusion bodies comprised of aberrantly conformed mutant proteins, a hallmark observed in
numerous aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive efforts to decipher the mechanisms
underlying toxicity in polyQ diseases, however, little progress has been made towards identifying targets for
therapeutic intervention.
Recently, the post-translational modification (PTM), AMPylation, has emerged as a novel regulator of HSP70
family chaperones, crucial components of the cell’s protein quality control machinery that buffer against protein
misfolding stress. Protein AMPylation is carried out by the fic-type AMPylase, FICD in humans, and its ortholog
FIC-1, in C. elegans, respectively. Work in our lab has established that FIC-1-mediated AMPylation directly alters
polyQ aggregation dynamics and toxicity. Further, my preliminary data as presented in this proposal identifies
fic-1 deficiency as sufficient to rescue survival of C. elegans expressing aggregation-prone polyQs during
development in a polyQ length-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that the loss of FIC-
1/FICD-mediated AMPylation bolsters proteostasis network capacity to alleviate toxicity induced by polyQ protein
aggregation.
This project will utilize cross-disciplinary approaches to generate a holistic characterization of FICD/FIC-1-
mediated AMPylation in polyQ diseases. To this end, I will harness the powerful genetics of C. elegans to uncover
novel pathway(s) that promote survival in the face of pathogenic polyQ aggregation (Aim 1). In tandem, I will
employ functional assays in neurons derived from HD and SCA3 patient stem cells to profile how FICD activity
affects polyQ aggregation and toxicity in these disease models (Aim 2). The results of these studies will advance
our knowledge of how AMPylation regulates proteostasis in polyQ diseases. The ultimate goal of my research is
to capitalize on these findings to develop translatable therapeutic approaches for aging-associated diseases."
10880898,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Tobacco use disorder is the most common substance use disorder. Cigarette smoking is highly concentrated among
individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES); however, they often lack access to smoking cessation services. Thus,
smoking cessation in low SES adults remains a critical public health concern that warrants further study and
attention. Smokers attempting to quit are at the highest risk for lapse within the first weeks of their quit attempt, and an
initial lapse is highly likely to lead to full relapse. It is essential to identify and understand behavioral factors that may
increase or decrease the likelihood of successful smoking cessation among low SES adults during a quit attempt (pre-
and post-quit). Recently, sleep dysregulation, such as insufficient sleep duration, has been considered as a potential
intervention target to improve smoking behavior (e.g., number of cigarettes smoked per day) and smoking cessation
outcomes (e.g., abstinence). On the other hand, studies have found the lower SES is associated with higher rates of
poor sleep. Thus, SES must be accounted for when assessing sleep dysregulation and smoking behavior and cessation
outcomes. Although previous studies have examined the relationship between sleep dysregulation and smoking
behavior and/or cessation outcomes, they have several methodological limitations, including the use of retrospective
survey methods, not using the integrated sleep health dimensions (usually only sleep duration or quality), use of cross-
sectional surveys, laboratory-based data collection, omitting low SES smokers, and focusing on a single pathway rather
than dynamic associations. Therefore, this proposal will use a Real-Time Data Capture approach among low SES
smokers who are attempting to quit. This approach will involve a granular examination of the bidirectional and temporal
association of daily sleep dysregulation and smoking cession processes (pre- and post-quit) using smartphone-based
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and wearable sensors among low SES smokers. Specifically, we aim: 1)
During the pre-quit period, to examine the within-person and between-person effects of sleep dysregulation on smoking
behavior and cessation and 2) During the post-quit period, to identify bidirectional and temporal associations of daily
smoking abstinence and sleep dysregulation via EMA and wrist-worn sensors during the first four weeks of a smoking
cessation attempt. The proposed research and training plan will take place at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New
Jersey. Training will focus on increasing knowledge of the understanding and measuring of sleep dimensions,
health disparities in smoking cessation studies, and application of advanced mHealth technologies (including
EMA and actigraphy data analyses techniques). It is expected that completion of these aims will yield the
necessary preliminary data for developing and implementing Just-in-Time-Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) that aim to
improve sleep health during smoking cessation."

NANOG Structure and Function in Stem Cell Pluripotency
 NANOG directs access to stem cell pluripotency. There are considerable gaps in our
molecular understanding of how NANOG coordinates this process. This is also compounded by
the fact that NANOG (in particular, human NANOG) has been a challenging system to work
with. The investigators have successfully applied innovative fluorescence techniques to
characterize NANOG’s key structure and functional properties. NANOG is an intrinsically
disordered protein (IDP), with a prion-like domain critical for NANOG self-assembly and for
establishing contacts in pluripotency specific regions. NANOG is a ‘molecular hub’, reported to
interact with >100 transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins to form cooperative hub
condensates and coordinate activation of pluripotency genes and repression of differentiation
genes. The investigators will investigate and deconvolute how NANOG dose-sensitivity play a
role in chromatin looping and recruitment of TFs, co-activators, and epigenetic regulators. They
will use an intensive holistic combination of standard and innovative structural, molecular,
genomic and cell biology approaches. The first aim will elucidate NANOG’s dose-sensitivity
mechanism in establishing pluripotency by assessing chromatin reorganization and recruitment
of cofactors using Hi-C 3.0 and single molecule fluorescence techniques. The second aim will
probe the molecular elements (i.e., OCT4-SOX2-NANOG triad cooperativity and KLF4
biomolecular condensation) involved in activating NANOG expression. In addition, the aim will
investigate the molecular basis for NANOG autorepression. The last aim will focus on inhibition
of NANOG stabilization and oligomerization with dominant negative NANOG-based peptides.
These studies will provide unprecedented insights into how NANOG orchestrates establishment
of stem cell pluripotency and reversal of developmental aging."
10873846,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The rapidly emerging modalities of long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatment and prevention
are based on a one-size-fits-all dosing strategy despite these being our first experiences in real-world settings,
where patient management challenges are common. To address this issue, we propose a novel pharmacologic
monitoring platform for long-acting ART in real-world settings. We aim to develop and validate at-home self-
collections and point-of-care (POC) testing for quantitative cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) concentrations to
support patient management and inform optimal use of long-acting ART and PrEP, with the vision that this
platform will be widely implementable and able to accommodate next in line long-acting HIV therapies in
development.
 CAB/RPV concentrations were influential in tightly controlled trials, even with a 1% virologic
breakthrough rate. Among 1,039 participants, CAB/RPV concentrations varied by more than 10-fold at a single
4-week post-injection time point. Of 13 observed HIV breakthroughs, none occurred when concentrations of
both drugs were above the median, no matter what other risk factors were present –including archived
resistance mutations. On the other end of the spectrum, some patients achieved CAB/RPV concentrations
well-above expected levels and could comfortably extend dosing beyond Q8W, but this possibility was not
adequately investigated. In practice, CAB/RPV concentrations will be more variable than in tightly controlled
trials because real-world patients miss appointments, change providers, and leave/reenter care. Additionally,
within-person variability from injection-to-injection is unknown. To address these gaps and needs, we propose
the following specific aims: Aim 1. Validate at-home self-collections and POC testing. Building on our
preliminary data using at-home self-collections and POC testing via miniature mass spectrometry, we will
develop and optimize suitable assays using samples from 30 persons with HIV (PWH) receiving Q4W or Q8W
long-acting injectable CAB/RPV. Assays will be validated using FDA bioanalytical guidance. Aim 2. Classify
CAB/RPV concentrations in a real-world longitudinal cohort. Through longitudinal blood collections in 50
PWH receiving Q4W or Q8W long-acting injectable CAB/RPV, we plan to classify drug concentrations into low,
expected, and high categories and define specific pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including within- and
between-person variability. Aim 3. Establish pharmacokinetic strategies for personalized dose intervals.
We will identify the ideal drug concentration testing strategy to determine patient-specific PK, and in turn, the
optimal dose frequency to achieve goal concentrations. We envision an easy-to-use interface where clinicians
will input drug concentrations to calculate personalized dosing. This application is timely and provides
innovations to keep pace with the rapidly emerging long-acting era."
10873849,"ABSTRACT
 There is a strong movement within the neuroscience community towards studying the brain under
naturalistic conditions, in rich multisensory paradigms and in the context of behaviors observed in natural
environments, such as free viewing. This requires transforming our traditional data collection and analysis
pipelines, and their underlying theoretical frameworks. Instead of focusing on one specific system supporting a
particular brain function, we must conduct multisite recordings targeting multiple, reciprocally connected
circuits, which is the main motivation for our project. Fortunately, this is now technically feasible in both human
and nonhuman primates.
 The overarching goal of our project is to define information transmitting (“driving”) vs. “modulatory”
circuits of the auditory system. The rationale for this goal is that if only driving circuits existed in the brain, we
would not have the ability to focus on behaviorally relevant aspects of our environment. From this perspective,
modulatory circuits play as an important role in brain operations as information transmitting ones.
 Specifically, our project will explore the interaction of four domains of brain function and the distinctive,
dynamic circuit motifs (circuits and their spectrotemporal neuronal activity patterns) that underlie them. These
brain functions are auditory perception, multisensory interactions within the auditory system, motor sampling of
the environment (eye movements), and memory recall.
 We will utilize electrophysiological recordings during behavioral experiments in non-human and human
primates, with computational modeling to bridge the gap between different recording scales (single unit to
EEG), and species (non-human primate vs. human). Computational models will also be used to suggest
specific target nodes and patterns of the distinct circuits for neuromodulation. Using the spectrotemporal
neuronal activity (a key feature of a dynamic circuit motif) and model prediction based intracranial electrical
brain stimulation, we will verify each identified circuit’s causal role in producing its unique circuit motifs and in
supporting different aspects of behavior."
10873944,"Seasonal influenza epidemics result in significant morbidity and mortality, and vaccine effectiveness is
disappointingly low. The rapid evolution of influenza viruses is a major barrier to effective vaccines, as new
strains with different antigenic properties are continuously generated within a remarkably large population of
infected hosts. This problem was highlighted in the recent NIAID strategic plan for influenza and in PA-18-859,
which highlight key knowledge gaps with respect to influenza virus evolution in individuals and its transmission
between them. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics
of influenza viruses in naturally infected human hosts. The objectives of this project are to use state-of-the-art
molecular approaches to define the host-level evolution of influenza and to identify correlates of infectivity and
transmission. This project will combine intensive sampling of viruses, matched sera, and clinical data from
naturally infected individuals and their contacts, which will allow for robust analyses of influenza evolution,
transmission, and spread. The feasibility of this approach is supported by published preliminary data, which show
that (i) serial sampling can be used to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses within naturally
infected people; (ii) next generation sequencing (NGS) can be used to identify transmission pairs and to estimate
the number of unique viral variants transmitted between individuals; (iii) temporal data on viral load and within-
host genetic diversity can inform mathematical models of transmission. Detailed analyses of influenza evolution
and transmission will be accomplished in three aims. (Aim 1) Identify the emergent antigenic variants that are
positively selected with hosts. NGS of serially sampled within-host viral populations will be used to identify
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase variants under positive selection within hosts and their relationship to host
immune status. The impact of these mutations on viral antigenicity will be evaluated using sera from enrolled
individuals. (Aim 2) Define the transmission bottleneck and the genetic variants that are transmitted. NGS of
serial samples from index cases and household contacts will be used to define household transmission chains,
the size of the transmission bottleneck, and which within host variants are transmitted. (Aim 3) Identify viral and
host factors associated with host susceptibility, infectivity, and transmission. A strain-specific household
transmission model, integrating molecular and epidemiologic data, will be used to estimate hazards of infection
from the community and each infected household contact. This work is innovative, because it leverages the
expertise of an existing productive team to combine state-of-the-art technologies for viral sequencing and
sophisticated modeling approaches to study influenza virus evolution and transmission in natural infection. The
proposed research is significant, because it will define the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses at the level
of individual hosts in a community setting."
10873946,"Project Summary
Neophobia is defined as a fearful reaction to novel stimuli or situations. When an animal encounters a novel
food, they approach and consume it with cautiousness. For humans, this behavior has significant health
consequences. Food Neophobia is especially prevalent in children, and the rejection of certain types of foods
has serious consequences for the acute health of the child. Moreover, food Neophobia in childhood has long-
lasting adverse effects on dietary choices associated with eating disorders, poor health outcomes, and disease.
In rodents, taste Neophobia is an important behavioral reaction that ensures a minimized threat of toxicity in
unfamiliar foods, including those that are inherently appetitive. When faced with a novel food or taste, animals
consume a relatively small amount during the initial encounter. If this consumption yields no adverse
consequences, a memory for a “safe” taste is formed, and animals will more readily increase their intake in
subsequent test sessions, a process is known as attenuation of Neophobia. While lesions studies have begun
to identify the brain regions involved in taste Neophobia and its attenuation, relatively little is known about the
underlying circuits or the neural correlates of these behaviors. For example, there have been no attempts at
exploring how Neophobia and attenuation impact neuronal responses in awake, behaving animals in key areas
of the central taste pathway, including the gustatory cortex, gustatory thalamus, and nucleus basalis. The overall
goal of this project is to understand this process by investigating how information regarding the novelty and
familiarity of tastes are encoded within these circuits. Our central hypothesis is that Neophobia is driven by
enhanced responses in both gustatory cortex and thalamus, and its attenuation is mediated by cholinergic activity
from basal forebrain inputs. We will use calcium imaging of defined cholinergic and gustatory cell types combined
with chemogenetic manipulation in awake animals during Neophobia and attenuation to test these hypotheses.
The findings of these experiments will be significant in that they will be the first to explore neuronal activity in
central taste regions during Neophobia and attenuation. Further, our findings will fundamentally advance our
knowledge of how taste Neophobia is encoded in central taste circuits and the role of cholinergic input in this
behavior. These findings will be important not only in increasing our understanding of this important form of taste
learning but also in furthering our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying novelty processing within
sensory regions."

While treatments for eradicating some infectious diseases have been successful, there is still a large gap in the
treatment of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, in particular as drug resistance continues
to grow as a problem. To address this evolving issue, scientists are needed who are trained to understand how
pathogens interact with the host, in order to better uncover opportunities and strategies for drug discovery. This
training program’s goal is to address this need by providing qualified graduate students with broad training in
infectious diseases and drug discovery, complemented by professional development opportunities, that prepares
them for a long productive career in infectious disease related research. The training program includes 21 faculty
members from 6 departments across 4 different colleges at Purdue University. These faculty members have
diverse and complementary research interests in infectious disease, drug discovery and drug delivery, structural
biology, and molecular biology. All of these faculty members are part of the Purdue Institute of Inflammation,
Immunology and Infectious Disease and the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. These institutes bring faculty
and trainees together through shared research space, a seminar series, journal clubs, and social events,
resulting in a unique and supportive training environment for the “Drug Discovery in Infectious Disease Training”
program. In this program, students will develop expertise both in infectious disease and in drug discovery.
Specifically, trainees will take a course focused on: 1) infectious diseases and drug discovery and 2) biological
membranes (a common theme of pathogen entry, exit and replication). To promote responsible, rigorous and
reproducible research practices, students will complete courses in statistical analysis and the responsible
conduct in research. To develop written communication skills, trainees also will take a grant-writing course,
where they participate in a collaborative, active learning environment to gain feedback on the development of an
NIH F31 style proposal. Additional training activities include participating in a seminar series, attending
regional/national scientific meetings, and completing a capstone project in the area of drug discovery in infectious
disease. In completing this semester-long capstone project, trainees will build teamwork, critical thinking and
data analysis skills, all while working in the context of drug discovery and infectious disease. The capstone
project will be complemented with networking and learning opportunities with industrial partners who are
developing new drugs for infectious diseases. Further, fellows have the opportunity to engage in entrepreneurial
training, an important aspect of academic drug discovery. Using a jointly developed Individual Development Plan,
the trainees and mentors will create a training plan that is tailored towards the students’ training needs and
career goals. In the end, the training program will have helped students work towards their desired career goals,
while also developing a workforce with a unique skillset for addressing the challenges of discovering therapies
for infectious disease.

(UGA) trains graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to become independent research scientists
who study parasitic diseases in the context of global health. The research program seeks fundamental
insights into protozoan and helminth parasites and their interaction with their mammalian hosts and
invertebrate vectors. It combines cutting-edge bench and field science with perspectives on the global
challenges and opportunities for the control and elimination of parasitic diseases. These perspectives
are grounded in firsthand experience by trainers and collaborators around the world. Every year
protozoan and helminth parasitic diseases of humans are responsible for more than a million deaths,
many millions more cases of severe morbidity, and hundreds of millions of cases of subtle morbidity
due to chronic infections. UGA is uniquely positioned as a training ground for the next generation of
parasitology/tropical disease researchers and the TTEGD is the central basis of their training and
development. The Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD) within UGA is home to
perhaps the largest number of parasitology research laboratories in the US that collectively cover the
full gamut of parasitic diseases. We believe that the breadth and culture of our program instill trainees
with the ability to translate basic scientific findings into tool development and the implementation of
interventions, and foster their ability to identify and formulate a fundamental research question out of
the context of parasitic disease itself. During the last funding period, the program has further grown and
flourished and selected students and postdocs participate in a number of activities tailored to their
preparation for their future success in science careers. Significant institutional commitment for breadth-
enhancing capstone experiences, a match for trainee lines, a reorganized innovative graduate
recruitment umbrella, and new diversity initiatives further strengthen this highly successful training
program. For the next funding period we introduce new initiatives including new requirements for
postdoc trainees, a more rigorous training of new trainers, new postdoc recruitment strategies to
increase diversity, new strategies to recruit underrepresented minorities, potential expansion of the
program with the use of matched trainee lines and new themes offered to trainees on large data mining
and computer science."

BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data
storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file
system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g., Google Cloud Platform).
We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem
and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles
advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation

indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-
based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable
understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2)
transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels
of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will
enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying
diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will
also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and
machine learning algorithms in the future."

each. They have also received several grants and career development awards (e.g. NIH, American Heart
Association, NSF, ACS). This program continues to build on our unique strengths in cardiovascular
research at the UofU, spanning basic and mechanistic investigation across a range of model systems and
translational studies in humans. This training program unifies the three major cardiovascular research
centers at the UofU Health Sciences Center: The Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and
Training Institute (CVRTI), the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the School of Medicine, and the
Molecular Medicine Program (U2M2) at the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics. This training program
spans 13 UofU departments and includes 54 well-funded faculty mentors who lead exciting and productive
cardiovascular research programs. Each trainee will participate in a two-year training program that includes
a research project with a multidisciplinary mentoring committee, didactic coursework, and professional
development opportunities. With this renewal application, we continue to request support to prepare 8
postdoctoral trainees to be leaders in cardiovascular research. The next stage of the training program will
utilize an expanded mentor pool and implement a dual-leadership structure by two cardiology physician-
scientists (MPIs: Stavros Drakos, MD, PhD, and Robin Shaw, MD, PhD) whose interests span from basic
biochemistry to clinical trials. This renewal occurs at a time with the UofU is increasing its already sizeable
investment into cardiovascular research training. A $6M addition to the CVRTI is being constructed to
increase the number of cardiovascular research laboratories in an institute already fully dedicated to
cardiovascular research and training. Also there is a campus-wide Cardiovascular Strategic Plan being
implemented to enhance cardiovascular research and care and the UofU. The next five years of the training
program will leverage these new resources and opportunities at the UofU and represents a new era of
interdisciplinary collaborative cardiovascular research at our institution."

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Sub Saharan Africa, where
aflatoxin contamination is common. In these areas, exposure to AFB1 starts early in life through maternal
routes during pregnancy. Populations in these countries experience early onset of HCC, and in utero AFB1
exposure may be a contributing factor to the onset of the disease. Exposures to nutrients, toxic chemicals and
biological agents during gestation and early childhood play a critical role in determining susceptibility to
diseases later in life. The mechanism of early onset of carcinogenesis may include epigenetic changes in
tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Our previous rodent study showed that in utero AFB1 exposure can alter
DNA methylation of TSGs. It is necessary to investigate the impact of in utero AFB1 exposure on methylation
and expression of TSGs in humans. The overall hypothesis is that in utero AFB1 exposure will differentially
methylate TSGs, and this methylation will inversely correlate with the expression of the TSGs. The overall
objective of this project is to establish a pre-birth cohort and study the association between in utero exposure
to AFB1 and DNA methylation changes in TSGs of newborns in Nigeria. To achieve this, we will recruit
pregnant women in the first trimester from two Nigerian hospitals serving a rural and an urban area. We
hypothesize that Nigerian women will have a range of AFB1 exposure levels detectable in plasma. We
hypothesize that in utero AFB1 exposure will be associated with differential methylation and expression of
TSGs in cord blood samples. The specific aims of this project are to 1) determine the levels of AFB1 in the
plasma of pregnant women, using HPLC, collected during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, and
newborns (cord blood), 2) assess the DNA methylation of TSGs in the cord blood via pyrosequencing and to
determine if AFB1 concentration is associated with the levels of DNA methylation, 3) determine the expression
of TSGs in the cord blood using real-time quantitative PCR and determine if gene expression is inversely
correlated with methylation changes in the TSGs. The findings of this study will provide data on AFB1
exposure among pregnant women in Nigeria and its subsequent effect on the epigenome of newborns. This
data will provide direction for future research developing epigenetic biomarkers of AFB1 exposure as well as
investigating epigenetic mechanisms associated with prenatal exposure to AFB1 and the risk of developing
liver cancer in Africa. This research direction may provide insight into reducing the incidence of this cancer in
sub-Saharan Africa, especially in countries such as Nigeria, where AFB1 exposure is highly prevalent. Through
this research, the PI will become a leader in environmental epigenetics, studying how early-life exposure to
environmental contaminants of Public Health concerns in Africa contributes to the development of non-
communicable diseases later in life."
10875507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Minnesota Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) recruits a diverse group of gifted
scholars with the highest caliber intellectual skills and character traits to pursue a rigorous, supportive
physician scientist training sequence that results in the awarding of both an MD and PhD in 8 years or less.
The pillars of our training program are an integration of clinical medicine and scientific discovery through all
phases of training, flexibility to meet the specific needs of individual students, continuous mentoring and career
development, community building to promote student retention, success, and well-being, and an enduring
commitment to diversity and inclusion as a foundation for excellence. Outstanding faculty preceptors provide
research opportunities in the biomedical sciences, engineering, computational biology, medicinal chemistry,
chemistry, epidemiology, and a new PhD opportunity in health policy. Significant investments in infrastructure
and physician scientist training across the career continuum have enhanced program development and
success. Our leadership team, which includes a new third Associate Director position, has clearly defined
responsibilities, and three new Associate Directors with complementary skills and expertise have been
appointed. Continuous quality improvement driven by feedback from our evaluation plan has resulted in
refinement of our longitudinal clinical continuity program during the PhD phase, increased numbers of women
and URM faculty preceptors, an expanded Women in Science and Medicine seminar program, new formal
exposure of first and second year MSTP students to grant writing and other professional competencies critical
for success in the PhD phase, new Research Showcase meetings to introduce new students to research
opportunities, a new PhD phase MSTP orientation session, a revised IDP, a new annual progress meeting
where the program meets with both the student and PhD advisor, and new resources and initiatives to help
advisors continue to improve their mentoring skills. A revised student governance structure has provided more
opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, lead program activities, enhance engagement with our
alumni, and improve program cohesion across years. During the past funding cycle, our trainees have
published in top-tier journals, and 24 trainees have been supported by NIH F30 or F31 awards. Our trainees
have successfully matched in outstanding residency and PSTP programs, and are successfully moving into
academic faculty positions. Our applicant pool is national in scope and total numbers are the highest ever, with
a 59% increase in applications compared to 2014. We have successfully recruited an average of 9 students
per year over the last 5 years while increasing our admissions yield. Our current student cohort is diverse, with
48% women and 22% from under-represented groups. A student-led diversity and inclusion group fosters an
outstanding program climate and student well-being. Increased support is being requested so that we can build
on this track record of success in matriculating, retaining and graduating top-tier MSTP students."
10873802,"Loss of NF1 plays a major role as an oncogenic driver in many cancer types and can be found in up to 33% of
all breast cancers (BC). Loss of NF1 is also a prognostic indicator for increased cancer risk at an earlier age,
poorer outcomes, and therapeutic resistance. In addition, certain NF1 genotypes may increase cancer risks,
while others do not. NF1 is largely perceived as a classic Ras-opathy syndrome due to inactivating mutations in
neurofibromin affecting Ras-MAPK signaling. However, recently it has been shown that NF1 binds estrogen
receptor (ER) and acts as a transcriptional corepressor. This helps explain some of these BC findings specifically
in ER+ BC patients. In this model, specific changes to NF1 that abrogate ER signaling lead to Ras driven tumor
resistance to endocrine therapy in up to 20% of ER+ patients as cells are able to grow in low levels of E2 (and
tamoxifen). We have generated novel rat models deficient for Nf1 that have a very robust ER+ BC phenotype,
therefore more closely recapitulating clinical tumors compared to other preclinical models. Our models include a
pathogenic patient missense allele c.3827G>A, p.R1276Q (knockin or KI), associated in humans with spinal NF1
and malignancy, as well as a 14 base pair deletion c.3661_3674del, p.P1220fs*1223 (knockout or KO) model.
Phenotypic differences between our models indicate that the variant matters, and restriction of tumor
development to pregnancy in the KI females indicates hormone induction plays a major role in tumor
development. Rats also develop lung lesions positive for metastatic BC markers. Our overall goal is to
characterize the phenotype of these rat models in terms of histopathology, Ras signaling, hormone signaling,
immune components, and targeted drug response and compare/contrast them with what is known regarding
patients with somatic or germline inactivation of NF1 and breast cancer. Ultimately, this will provide better
prognostic predictions for patients and better therapeutics for treatment. Aim 1 will evaluate tumor onset, growth,
histology, and molecular characterization of Ras and estrogen signaling over time and compare/contrast with
human BC tumor samples. Aim 2 will characterize the Nf1 deficient tumor microenvironment (TME), identify
immuno-targets, and evaluate immuno-targeting with and without Ras-targeting therapeutics. Aim 3 will
evaluate the role of hormones in tumor initiation, maintenance and targeting therapeutics. We will better define
which hormone(s) drive both initiation and maintenance of mammary tumors deficient for Nf1 and utilize this
information to target them both with and without co-targeting Ras to show synergy. As HR+ BC accounts for
~80% of patient cases, and that appropriate mammalian models with intact immune systems are lacking, we
believe that our proposed studies are highly significant and will substantially advance the development of new
therapies to this disease."

This is the third renewal application requesting T32 funding for the UCSF Behavioral Neurology Training Program
(BNTP), co-directed by Drs. Howard Rosen and Bruce Miller. The BNTP was established at UCSF in 1999 within
the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) to train clinical researchers in behavioral neurology and
neurodegenerative disease. Funded in 2005, this T32 program allows emerging researchers to gain an
integrated understanding of the clinical, epidemiological, genetic, and molecular features of neurodegenerative
diseases, and is one of the few programs in the world that provides intensive training on the non-Alzheimer’s
dementias and non-amnestic forms of AD. The goal of the program is to train postdoctoral clinical researchers
for a career in neurodegenerative research. The program is open to MD neurologists, geriatricians and
psychiatrists who have completed a residency. A core element of our program is accurate classification of
dementia subtypes and prediction of the specific proteins causing neurodegeneration. Our training is designed
to impart fellows with the skills to evaluate and quantify the effects of various proteins and other biological factors
that cause dementia using clinical assessment and laboratory methods. Training takes place over two years.
The first year consists of research rotations through four clinical research programs at our center including our
program project grant on frontotemporal dementia, our Alzheimer’s disease research program, our rapidly
progressive dementia program and our clinical trials program. During this year, fellows begin development of
their research project with one of the program mentors and develop skills in scientific writing, presentation, and
in data analysis using archival data from our clinical and imaging databases. In the second year, fellows are
given more unstructured time to continue their research project and plan for grant submissions to support their
future career in clinical research. Over the years, our program has strengthened relationships with UCSF
Psychiatry and Geriatrics, and this has influenced our research, recruitment, and approach to training. Twenty-
nine fellows have been supported directly by this T32, but the infrastructure developed through the T32 program
contributes to the education of many additional postdoctoral fellows. In the upcoming cycle the training program
will include additional didactic sessions covering social determinants of health, health economics and policy,
along with leadership training."
10873805,"Despite the clear benefits of physical activity on recovery and survival following an acute coronary
syndrome (ACS), most of the 1 million Americans suffering an ACS each year are unable to reach adequate
levels of activity. Comprehensive in-person programs to promote activity after an ACS can be effective, but
they are attended by relatively few patients. Telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI), which has led
to increased physical activity in cardiac patients, is a promising evidence-based alternative to in-person
programs. However, the overall magnitude of MI’s effects on physical activity has been relatively modest in
cardiac-related populations, and additional content may be needed.
Psychological well-being (e.g., optimism, positive affect) is prospectively and independently associated
with greater physical activity, and therefore cultivating well-being in post-ACS patients could provide an
additional method to promote activity in this population. Positive psychology (PP) interventions utilize specific
activities (e.g., reflecting on positive events, using personal strengths, imagining a better future) to increase
well-being, and they have led to increased physical activity in patients with
m
edical illness.
A combined PP-MI intervention could be a powerful, synergistic approach to promoting activity after an
ACS. PP could increase physical activity by improving well-being, while
participants set and achieve personalized activity goals. PP could also boost participant engagement in
M I could enhance motivation and help
M I by
fostering optimism and self-efficacy, both of which are linked to greater uptake of interventions like MI. In an
NHLBI-funded multiphase project, our team has developed and piloted a new, remotely-delivered PP-MI
program in post-ACS patients, and PP-MI led to substantial increases in physical activity in this initial work.
 Accordingly, we now propose a randomized controlled trial of this 24-week phone- and text-based PP-
MI intervention, compared to contemporary treatment as usual, among 280 post-ACS patients with low
baseline physical activity. PP-MI utilizes weekly phone sessions for 12 weeks and twice-weekly text messaging
for a total of 24 weeks to provide ongoing content and support. We will conduct follow-up assessments at 12,
24, and 48 weeks. The primary outcome for this trial is improvement in moderate to vigorous physical activity
(MVPA, measured via accelerometer), and the primary study hypothesis is that PP-MI will be associated with
significantly greater improvement in MVPA than treatment as usual at 24 weeks. We will also examine the
effects of PP-MI on multiple additional outcomes, including other measures of activity (light activity, sedentary
time), psychological/functional measures, and health-related outcomes, including cardiac biomarkers and rates
of major adverse cardiac events. Finally, we will systematically assess potential clinical implementation of the
PP-MI intervention. If this new program is more successful than the current standard of care in increasing
activity after ACS, it could be adopted in clinical practice to improve prognosis in these high-risk patients."
10873897,"Uropathogenic bacteria must acquire nutrients present in urine or those released by an inflamed or damaged
epithelium to successfully colonize the urinary tract. Our long term goal is to understand the contribution of each
virulence factor and core gene that allows uropathogens to colonize, persist, and damage the urinary tract. Our
overall objective is to identify and study essential transporters required by uropathogenic Escherichia coli
(UPEC), a cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), and Proteus mirabilis, a cause of catheter-
associated UTI, for growth and survival in the human urinary tract. Both E. coli and P. mirabilis are members of
the Enterobacteriaceae, are motile, produce numerous and distinct fimbriae with which they mediate adherence
to the uroepithelium, secrete hemolysins and proteases, and elaborate siderophores and heme-binding proteins
to capture iron from the host. While we have previously studied all of these classes of virulence determinants,
we now propose to focus on transport systems as critical functions for the survival of these two pathogens. In
this proposal, we will advance the central hypothesis that uropathogenic E. coli and P. mirabilis differentially
employ transport systems, unique to each species, to acquire peptides/amino acids and sugars, respectively, to
establish fitness advantages in the urinary tract. We will test this hypothesis by carrying out the following specific
aims: 1) Identify specific transport systems required for the development of urinary tract infection by
uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. 2) Determine the kinetic parameters of unique and
common transporters that contribute to the virulence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in
the urinary tract. In the first aim, we will identify genes from among 643 identified transporter genes of E. coli and
386 identified transport genes of P. mirabilis, that when mutated result in a fitness defect in the mouse model of
ascending UTI. We will use a Tn-seq screen of ordered transposon libraries of both species in the mouse model
of UTI, expression data from in vivo RNA-seq transcriptomes, transurethral cochallenge of mice with clean
deletion mutants vs the wild type strain, and urine metabolomes to select transporters for further study. In the
second aim, prioritized transporters will be characterized for growth in filter-sterilized human urine, minimal
medium containing the known or suspected substrate, and Biolog assays to confirm substrates and identify
transporters that share the same substrate. Kinetics of substrate uptake [KT (affinity for substrate) and Vmax (rate
of transport)] will be measured using radiolabeled substrates. Finally, a hierarchy of transporters will be
established for UPEC and P. mirabilis. The expected outcome of conducting these aims will be to characterize
key transport systems and their substrates of our two most troublesome uropathogens. The positive impact will
include identification of novel targets of antimicrobial therapy."
10873899,"SUMMARY
This proposal will test the over-arching hypothesis that extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli
(ExPEC) overcomes inhibition by urogenital Lactobacilli via sequential activation of inter-connected acid
resistance (AR) mechanisms. We further postulate that transient internalization of ExPEC into vaginal epithelial
cells increases fitness by enhancing induction of acid resistance and other mechanisms of persistence that
enable bacteria to gain access and survive in otherwise harsh host environments. The hypothesis to be tested
has been formulated based on the following strong preliminary data: (1) We discovered a novel AR mechanism
in ExPEC that is controlled via a non-canonical signaling system, BtsS-YpdB and it uses L-serine deamination
to neutralize bacterial cytosolic pH. We call this new AR mechanism, AR6. (2) BtsS-YpdB signaling is induced
during infection and in response to several Lactobacillus species. (3) Deletion of btsS-ypdB significantly
decreases ExPEC acid tolerance and vaginal colonization. (4) Strains lacking L-serine deaminases, or BtsS-
YpdB differentially react to the inhibitory actions of representative urogenital L. gasseri and L. delbrueckii
isolates. (5) Deletion of btsS-ypdB alters the induction and function of the known acid-sensing system EvgSA
that controls the most prominent, known AR mechanism, AR2. We will test these hypotheses using the most
prevalent ExPEC pathotype, uropathogenic E. coli. Uropathogenic E. coli is the main cause of urinary tract
infections (UTIs), an infection that disproportionately afflicts women. Similarly, ExPEC strains are the leading
cause of infection-related stillbirths. Despite the dominant paradigm that the low pH of vagina is protective against
pathogens, we and others have shown that colonization of the vagina by ExPEC can serve as a nidus for infection
of the urinary tract, the cervix, uterine horns and the gravid uterus. Vaginal colonization is therefore a key step
in pathogenesis. While several acid resistance (AR) mechanisms have been identified that are active in the gut,
the relative contribution of each AR mechanism during ExPEC infection remains undefined. With our aims, we
will: Interrogate the significance of transient bacterial expansion in the host as a priming niche for the
amplification of acid resistance and other persistence mechanisms (Aim 1). We will evaluate the individual and
combined contributions of AR mechanisms to the colonization potential of ExPEC in the vagina, bladder and gut
and will elucidate the connection of the novel AR6 pathway we discovered to the induction and function of AR2
(Aim 2). Finally, building on exciting preliminary data we will investigate the potential of urogenital Lactobacilli
strains in their ability to override ExPEC acid resistance, aiming to identify effective probiotic strategies to prevent
ExPEC reservoir formation in the vagina (Aim 3). Completion these aims will uncover how ExPEC leverage
their multiple AR systems to transit the host and evade elimination and will inform our efforts towards
developing effective probiotic strategies to prevent, vaginal colonization and combat genitourinary tract
infections."

Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), a rate that is significantly higher than the general population. Survival of children with DS
and ALL (DS-ALL) remains inferior to that of children without DS due to both excess relapse and infection-
related mortality (IRM). In the non-DS population, overall survival is over 90%, while children with DS-ALL
have an overall survival closer to 80%. Unfortunately, the increased intensity of chemotherapy regimens
responsible for recent survival gains in childhood ALL has led to unacceptably high rates of IRM in children
with DS. Understanding the basis for IRM in this population is critical to improving their survival rates and
disease outcomes. Currently, there are no biomarkers to stratify children with DS-ALL based on
identification of those at high risk for IRM. Further, there is a gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms
underlying this increase in IRM in DS-ALL patients. The ability to identify DS-ALL patients at high risk of
IRM will allow treatment modification and supportive care to be provided at treatment onset to prevent
mortality of these patients from fungal, bacterial and viral infections. In this proposal we will utilize DS
mouse models treated with ALL chemotherapy regimens, expose them to infectious pathogens and screen
for circulating biomarkers that will be validated in blood from DS-ALL patients with and without severe
infectious toxicity. Proposed studies will also validate candidate germline genomic variants associated with
risk of severe infection in children with DS during ALL chemotherapy. Our studies will focus on defects in
the innate immune system as the underlying basis for increased IRM in children with DS-ALL. Reducing
IRM in DS-ALL patients is critical to improving outcomes in this vulnerable population."
10880990,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by insulin deficiency resulting from reduced
function and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. Although many T-cell-dependent
mechanisms underlie T1D progression, the role of the β-cell responses in promoting autoimmune inflammation
is poorly understood. Our long-range goals are to determine the role of the three ubiquitously expressed
bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family members (BRD2/3/4) in β-cell transcriptional responses to
inflammation associated with autoimmune diabetes. Each BET protein contains two bromodomains, which are
epigenetic ‘readers’ of lysine acetylation on histones and transcription factors, and bromodomain binding to
acetylated histones/proteins regulates transcription in a gene- and cell-type dependent manner. Interestingly,
pan inhibitors that equally target both bromodomains of all BET proteins elicit broad anti-inflammatory effects
and delay diabetes onset in the non-obese diabetic T1D mouse model. However, the direct effects of BET
bromodomain inhibitors on the function and viability of β-cells are largely unknown. We hypothesize that β-cell
inflammation (Aim 1) and identity (Aim 2) can be regulated by selectively inhibiting BET proteins in a
bromodomain- and cell-type-specific manner. Broad inhibition of all BET bromodomains and the inability to
directly target specific cell types are significant challenges, and such broad inhibition is associated with dose-
limiting toxicities and adverse effects. We will address these limitations by evaluating the transcriptional actions
of next-generation BET bromodomain inhibitors that are selective for a subset of BET bromodomains (Aim 1
and 2) and develop innovative methods to selectively target BET bromodomain inhibitors to β cells (Aim 3).
Completing these aims will uncover the precise gene- and cell-type-specific mechanisms by which BET
bromodomain inhibition modulates β-cell transcription, inform the development of next-generation β-cell
targeted inhibitors, and advance T1D treatment and β-cell replacement strategies."

Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are frequently reported to have co-infection with other respiratory viruses,
including respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Respiratory virus co-
infection may lead to more severe COVID-19 and worse clinical outcomes, but this is complicated by
ascertainment biases in clinical testing algorithms that make co-detection of multiple respiratory pathogens more
likely in the most at-risk and severely ill children. Severe COVID-19 outcomes have been previously linked to
immune dysregulation following infection, but it is unknown how the host response to SARS-CoV-2 may be
influenced by co-infection with another respiratory virus. Likewise, it is unclear what impact co-infection may
have on intra-host viral dynamics, including viral load, time to clearance, and viral diversification, all of which
may contribute to the evolution of new variants with enhanced immune evasion or antiviral resistance. We
hypothesize that children with SARS-CoV-2 experience frequent respiratory virus co-infection, and that this co-
infection is associated with more severe disease, increased inflammation and mucosal injury in the upper
respiratory tract, and enhanced viral diversity due to increased persistence and viral load. We propose to test
this hypothesis in three aims designed to: 1) assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory virus co-
infection and its association with clinical outcome; 2) characterize the mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-
2 and how it differs in response to viral co-infection; and 3) determine the influence of co-infection on viral intra-
host dynamics and evolution. To achieve this goal, we will leverage our retrospective biobank of residual COVID-
19 diagnostic specimens from Lurie Children’s Hospital (n>6000 specimens collected since March 2020) as well
as prospectively collected specimens spanning a total of 6 years. In Aim 1, we will use a combination of multiplex
PCR and hybrid-capture sequencing to establish respiratory virus co-infection prevalence over time. Electronic
medical record data will be used to examine associations between co-infection, clinical outcomes, and disease
severity, adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical cofactors, including treatment, vaccination, and prior
infection. In Aim 2, bulk transcriptomic sequencing, cytokine profiling, immune cell profiling, and single-cell RNA
sequencing will be used to assess the mucosal immune response in co-infected individuals and controls. Host
response data will be modeled in the context of the extracted demographic and clinical metadata to determine
association with disease severity and outcomes. In Aim 3, viral whole genome sequencing and quantitative PCR
will be used to assess viral load, intra-host quasispecies composition, and genetic diversity. Phylogenetic and
phylodynamic models will be used to determine evolutionary rate and selection. Mutations in antiviral drug targets
will be assessed for resistance potential. Taken together, these data will clarify the prevalence, clinical impact,
and virus-host dynamics underlying SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory virus co-infection in children towards the
development of evidence-based guidance to optimize diagnosis/treatment and minimize morbidity."
10882457,"ABSTRACT
The incidence of immune mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, has grown exponentially
over the last decades. This has been linked to a variety of factors, including dietary preservatives and
processed food. Interest has recently turned to salt (NaCl) is a potential culprit. Abundant data show that high
salt diets can activate intestinal mucosal inflammation and increase severity up to a variety of experimental
disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, and experimental animals. Further,
some epidemiologic studies have correlated salt intake with frequency of immune-media disease. We recently
discovered that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of claudin-2, which forms a paracellular Na+ channel
within the intestinal epithelium, is an effective intervention in experimental, immune-mediated inflammatory
bowel disease. Our additional studies indicate that claudin-2 overexpression in transgenic mice promotes Th17
polarization of mucosal immune cells while claudin-2 deletion promotes Tregs development. A high salt diet
also activates mucosal IL-17 production in claudin-2 transgenic, but not knockout, mice. Thus, expression of
the paracellular Na+ channel protein claudin-2 synergizes with dietary salt to promote mucosal inflammation.
This is relevant to wide variety of inflammatory intestinal disorders, especially inflammatory bowel disease,
because claudin-2 expression is markedly upregulated in these settings. Thus, this is the potential of creating a
vicious cycle where claudin-2 and dietary salt promote inflammation and, in turn, the inflammation signals back
to the epithelium and causes further upregulation of claudin-2. High salt diets are also well-recognized to affect
the microbiota. We found that the effect of high salt diet on the microbiome was modified by claudin-2
overexpression or deletion. This suggests that the immune changes induced by claudin-2 expression or
deletion also modify the microbiome or, alternatively, microbial changes feedback to alter the immune system.
Examples of both mechanisms have been reported in other settings. Finally, is possible that claudin-2 and
dietary salt affect immune system and microbiota separately. Regardless of which affect his primary, these
data provide strong support for the conclusion that claudin-2 inhibitors should be developed as potential
therapeutic agents. Unfortunately, structural data and general understanding of how claudin-2 paracellular
channels are created and regulated are limited. Thus, the second aim of this proposal seeks to define
structure-function relationships in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that determine claudin-2
biology and to identify potential molecular interfaces to be targeted therapeutically."

10881076,"Abstract
Circulating proteomic profiles are strongly influenced by diet and may act as important molecular
transducers of the diet’s effects on coronary heart disease (CHD). Dietary quality and
circadian/temporal eating habits have been consistently related to CHD. However, how these factors
may affect CHD progression mechanistically remains poorly defined. Recent studies indicate that diet is
among the leading factors determining personalized and diet-specific differences in the proteome and
proteotypes defined by specific combinations of proteomic profiles. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to perform proteome-wide study of the dynamic interrelationships between diet (quality and
circadian/temporal eating patterns), circulating proteomic profiles, and CHD risk. Using an exceptionally
cost-efficient design that leverages existing resources from six large prospective cohorts: the Nurses’
Health Study (NHS), NHS2, the POUNDS LOST trial, Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, and UK Biobank, we propose to identify the
proteotypes for the dietary quality and circadian/temporal eating patterns measured by ‘gold standard’
and objective nutrition assessment methods (Aim 1). We will examine the associations of circulating
proteomic profiles (dietary factors and circadian/temporal eating patterns-related proteotypes, and
proteome-wide profiles) and their dynamic changes over 10 years with incidence of CHD (Aim 2). We
will also assess whether non-protein vascular risk factors for CHD mediate the proteome-CHD relation
(Aim 3). In addition, we will perform multi-omics analysis on the proteome-metabolome associations
with CHD (Aim 4). This renewal application is built upon an exceptional resource for understanding
CHD risk factors in women and has been continuously funded for 38 years (resulting in >410
publications and contributing to the training of >200 early-career investigators). The findings of our
proposed project are expected to lead to identification of new determinants of CHD at the molecular
level, offer novel insight into the mechanistic pathways, and advance the development of new
preventive and therapeutic strategies."
10881437,"Close to 2.5 million Americans are currently living with post-stroke aphasia, a debilitating communication disorder
affecting multiple language modalities. Most stroke survivors with aphasia have acquired reading deficits, which
persist chronically and severely limit life participation and autonomy. There is an urgent need for effective
treatments grounded in stroke neurobiology which yield robust functional improvements. Treatments targeting
impaired reading processes and aimed at restoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) can meet this need by directly
remediating dysfunctional brain mechanisms. In the proposed R01 we will combine aerobic exercise training
(AET) with an intensive phono-motor reading treatment (PMT). Our central hypothesis is that a single bout of
aerobic exercise will increase CBF and oxygenation, and if delivered before a PMT session, will facilitate
treatment-induced neuroplasticity, strengthening damaged phonological networks and leading to robust
functional improvements over time. We and others found that reduced CBF in parts of the left hemisphere outside
the stroke lesion persists for weeks to months after a stroke and predicts more severe language deficits and
worse recovery. Phonological processing, or the ability to derive sound structure of words, critical to so many
language modalities, is consistently impaired in left-hemisphere stroke survivors with aphasia and reding deficits.
We expect that the proposed treatment targeting both the impaired CBF, and phonological deficits will markedly
increase treatment effectiveness and enhance generalization to untrained language modalities. We will test our
central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. Under Aim 1, we will determine if combined AET and PMT
improve language outcomes by carrying out a randomized controlled trial in 70 individuals with chronic left-
hemisphere stroke. Participants will complete either 20 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or light stretching
prior to each session of intensive PMT. We expect that while both groups should improve, the AET group will
show more robust language improvements after 40 sessions of combined AET+PMT. Under Aims 2-3, we will
study both the immediate and sustained impact of AET and PMT on brain function using 3 MRI scans,
administered before the intervention, after the initial aerobic exercise session, and after the full course of AET +
PMT treatment. We expect that aerobic exercise will have an immediate positive impact on CBF and resting
state functional connectivity, as well as induce a sustained improvement in these measures and in task-related
brain activity compared to the pre-intervention baseline. While each of these interventions in isolation has shown
positive impact on stroke recovery, the proposed project will test if AET promotes acquisition and retention of
therapy skills when adjuvant to PMT. This has the potential to radically change how these treatments are applied,
increasing their effectiveness, and ultimately improving the lives of 2.5 million Americans living with stroke-
related aphasia. In addition, it is likely that the results will contribute to the understanding of stroke recovery
mechanisms thereby fundamentally advancing the field of neurorehabilitation."
10881549,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than 50% of cones can be lost before vision degrades, a discrepancy which can prevent earlier diagnosis
of retinal diseases. A gap exists in understanding the relationships between the degrees of cone loss and impact
on specific visual circuits and behavior. Rigorously establishing such links would benefit earlier diagnosis and
treatment monitoring. Barriers to understanding these relationships and to the long-term goal of improving
diagnosis and treatment of photoreceptor degenerations, include (1) simultaneous examination of a visual
behavior and its underlying physiology in ganglion cells specialized for that visual behavior; and (2) identification
of factors that influence vulnerability. To address the knowledge gap, this proposal will pursue the following
objectives: (1) Define links among the degree of cone deficit, the fidelity of a visually-evoked behavior, and the
physiological properties of specific ganglion cell types that underlie that behavior, and (2) Identify factors that
enable the prediction of the relative vulnerability of ganglion cells to cone loss. Our central hypothesis is that the
optokinetic reflex can provide an accurate psychophysical reflection of cone loss, and further, that ganglion cells
with more original cone inputs are uniformly more vulnerable to cone loss than ganglion cells with fewer cones.
This is bolstered by evidence that the most sensitive retinal ganglion cells can be resilient to 50% cone loss,
particularly when its dendritic field is smaller, which implicates cell size as a determinant of resilience.
Additionally, prior work has identified a reflexive behavior exclusively driven by ON direction selective ganglion
cells (oDSGCs), identifying a system to link graded cone loss in a specific circuit from ganglion cell to behavior.
Furthermore, the vertical optokinetic reflex has more robust eye movements in the superior vs. inferior directions,
which can be attributed to asymmetric excitatory synaptic inputs to oDSGCs, with greater excitation to superior
preferring than the inferior preferring oDSGCs. This visual reflex will be used to understand how original cone
inputs influence the vulnerability of a circuit and ultimately a behavior. The hypothesis will be tested in the
following aims: (Aim 1) Determine how varying degrees of cone loss affects a specific behavioral readout and
the underlying population of ganglion cells critical to that behavior, and (Aim 2) Identify circuit mechanisms that
determine the vulnerability of specific ganglion cell types to partial cone loss. The aims will be accomplished by
inducing graded cone loss, single-cell retinal physiology, quantifying a visual reflex, and computational models.
The significance includes (1) a systematic definition of how a circuit performs at specified degrees of input loss,
and (2) knowledge about circuit mechanisms that influence ganglion cell vulnerability. The positive impact of this
work is to enable the prediction of degrees of cone loss and estimation of health across ganglion cell populations
by using a visual reflex as a diagnostic into the overall state of the degenerating retina. These results will lend
insight to interpret the findings in humans demonstrating a discrepancy between cone loss and visual deficit, and
ultimately lead to the design of more sensitive biomarkers for monitoring retinal health."

Optimal infant feeding practices, including exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for 6 months, play a critical role in
determining the health, growth, and development of children, yet a large portion of infants in India lack the
benefit of optimal feeding practices. Community-based programs directed at improving feeding practices of
mothers in India are needed.
 The objective of this application is to conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial of our
Breastfeeding Education Support Tool for Baby (BEST4Baby) intervention. BEST4Baby consists of prenatal
and post-delivery breastfeeding education and support for mothers provided by community-based peer
counselors who are trained in a 5-day WHO/UNICEF Breastfeeding Counselling Course and supported by an
mHealth application. In Aims 1 and 2, we will test the effect of BEST4Baby on EBF for 6 months, infant growth
velocity, and infant neurodevelopment. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 4 sites across
Karnataka State, India, with 16 Primary Health Subcenters (i.e., “clusters”) within each site randomized in a 1:1
ratio to one of two study arms (usual care [control] or BEST4Baby [intervention]). Eighteen pregnant women in
each of the clusters (N=1,152) will receive either routine health education during the prenatal and postnatal
period or 11 in-person BEST4Baby intervention visits (2 during pregnancy, 9 post-delivery) from peer-
counselors. All participants will be followed longitudinally until their infants are 12 months of age to test the
effect of assigned study arm on outcomes. In Aim 3, the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidate Framework
for Implementation Research will guide our mixed-methods approach to evaluate BEST4Baby’s
implementation and to identify implementation facilitators and barriers to inform sustainability and future
adoption. Completion of this study will fill an evidence gap by demonstrating whether BEST4Baby is an
effective mechanism to improve maternal behaviors and whether this intervention translates to improved
clinical outcomes in infants. Findings from this project will also provide evidence needed to implement
BEST4Baby across India and in other low resource communities.
 This project is guided by NICHD’s mission to enhance the lives of children. It aligns with four of NICHD’s
cross-cutting scientific priorities - health disparities, disease prevention, nutrition, and global health - as well as
NICHD’s Pediatric Growth and Nutrition Branch as BEST4Baby is aimed at promoting health during infancy, a
critical period in human development. Given the lack of comprehensive prenatal and post-delivery
breastfeeding support within the current India healthcare system and that India contributes one-fifth of all
global live births, improving infant feeding practices of mothers in India, and thus improving infant health, could
have major public and global health implications and we anticipate this research will be of significant impact."
10880813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of
death globally by a single infectious agent. There continues to be an urgent and unmet need for new drugs,
diagnostics, vaccines, and host-directed therapies for TB. Two critical events that occur early after Mtb aerosol
transmission are the confinement of the initial inoculum into alveolar macrophages (AM), the first cells infected
in the lung, and the slow establishment of T cell priming and the adaptive immune response. These two features
highlight the importance of early recognition by the host in affecting the course of TB disease and the significant
role of lung-resident AM in initiating the host immune response. As innate airway sentinels, AM must recognize
Mtb bacilli and respond quickly in order to recruit other innate cells to the site of infection, including cells that will
transport bacteria to the draining lymph node for T cell priming. We have previously shown that upon infection
with Mtb in vivo, AM mount an Nrf2-dependent cell-protective, rather than pro-inflammatory, response that
impedes an effective host response and contributes to early Mtb replication. However, the AM response to Mtb
also has plasticity. We observed that mycobacterial exposure, either through BCG vaccination or a contained
Mtb infection, leads to AM cell-intrinsic and durable remodeling, including up-regulation of Interferon Response
Genes and a robust pro-inflammatory response to Mtb, that is associated with an accelerated host response and
enhanced bacterial control after Mtb challenge. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate mechanisms that
restrain or enhance AM responses to Mtb to better understand the regulation of the early events during infection.
In Aim 1, we will categorize AM sensing abilities and defects using both ex vivo and in vivo delivery of Mtb-
related Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), and screen for novel negative regulators of AM innate
sensing using a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library. In Aim 2, we will determine how Type I and II Interferons regulate
AM innate responses using in vitro models and in vivo cell transfer approaches. In Aim 3, we will evaluate how
alterations in AM sensing by Type I and II Interferons impact downstream events in Mtb infection by measuring
changes to innate cell recruitment, transfer of bacteria to the draining lymph node, T cell priming, and AM antigen
presentation in murine aerosol Mtb infection and a macrophage-T cell co-culture system. The studies are
motivated by the hypothesis that the hypo-inflammatory response of AM during Mtb infection is a result of the
reliance on AM as the initial Mtb sentinel, a function for which they are impaired, and the absence of early
systemic signals such as Type I and II Interferons, for which AM are highly sensitive. A better understanding of
the regulation of AM during Mtb infection will inform development of new vaccines and host-directed therapies."
10881271,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are powerful biophysical
techniques that are extensively used at the College of Staten Island (CSI) to answer chemical and biophysical
questions of medical relevance. Both techniques require the extensive use of liquid helium (for cooling either the
superconducting magnet in NMR or the sample in EPR). This liquid helium is lost to evaporation over time and
needs to be periodically resupplied to the superconducting magnets and to the EPR cryostat every time
experiments are conducted. Given that helium is a scarce and non-renewable natural resource that is obtained
as a by-product of natural gas extraction, this loss of helium through evaporation is a wasteful mismanagement
of a scarce and critically important resource. To alleviate the current helium shortage, systems have been
developed that allow the capture and re-liquefaction of evaporating helium gas. If deployed widely, these systems
can significantly reduce overall helium consumption and reduce the current nationwide shortages.
Given the significant use of liquid helium for two NMR and one EPR spectrometer at CSI, our institution would
be a good candidate for the installation of a helium recycling solution. We therefore propose to acquire an
integrated liquid helium recycling system consisting of a liquefier, a purifier and a recovery and storage system.
Such a system will reduce our yearly liquid helium use by 80-90 %, therefore ensuring the continued viability of
our NMR and EPR research instrumentation even during supply shortages and order caps. In addition, the price
of helium has strongly increased over the last few years, and the reduced cryogen expenses achieved by helium
recycling will help ensure a stable financial future for the NMR facility without making NMR usage fees
unaffordable for our local and visiting academic researchers.
The magnetic resonance facilities at CSI facilitate a range of biomedical research projects, including from several
NIH-funded principal investigators. Such projects include a) the study of antimicrobial and pro-inflammatory
activities mediated by S100A12 in innate immunity, b) the biophysical analysis of interactions between peptide
toxins and human sodium channel voltage-sensor domains and c) the development of resistance-proof, immune-
friendly drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Additional research that is supported by these facilities involves method
development in membrane structural biology, mechanistic studies of metallo-enzymes, the preparation of
nanoparticles for drug delivery, measurement of singlet oxygen for antibacterial application in dental medicine,
and other projects in the areas of synthetic and polymer chemistry as well as neurobiology. Lastly, these facilities
are also important for the training and career preparation of undergraduate, Masters and PhD students both in
lab courses and through independent research with our faculty. The acquisition of a helium recycling system will
ensure the continued availability of this important resource and contribute to the strengthening of the research
enterprise at CSI."

Abstract
Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 2 (ADO2) is a rare osteosclerotic disorder resulting from impaired
osteoclastic bone resorption most commonly due to mutations in the Chloride Channel 7 gene, which cause
disease by a dominant negative mechanism. Penetrance is approximately 66% and disease severity varies
widely. Affected individuals typically have at least one significant clinical manifestation including fractures,
osteonecrosis, osteomyelitis, blindness, or bone marrow failure. Ten of our patients have died (out of >80 with
clinical manifestations) either of disease manifestations or from attempts at therapy for severe disease. The
natural progression of disease manifestations in ADO2 is unknown, although limited data suggests that the
disease gets worse with age. Although no effective therapy is currently available, studies in animal models
have generated promising data and human trials on are on the horizon. Therefore, it is imperative to
understand the natural history of ADO2, including reliable biological markers and relevant patient centered
outcomes, to measure therapeutic effect, and to guide the design of clinical trials. The proposed natural history
study will establish a cohort of serially phenotyped subjects to capture clinically important outcomes and
characterize variations in disease severity, progression of disease, and novel biomarkers for current or future
disease severity. The goals of this study are to 1) identify clinically relevant biological and patient-reported
outcomes; and 2) use previously obtained data along with data obtained during this 3-year study to determine
the natural history of ADO2, including the rate of disease progression. We will focus on the following specific
aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine key markers of disease severity and endpoints for a clinical trial.
A. Refine and validate a composite clinical severity grading scale.
B. Determine which clinical, biological, radiological, and densitometric endpoints best define current disease
 severity and predict future disease severity and outcomes (combining samples and data obtained in our
 prior studies with new prospective serial measurements in participating subjects).
C. Test the hypothesis that ADO2 disease severity gets worse with age.
Specific Aim 2: Expand an electronic patient registry, to collect population-based, longitudinal quality-of-life,
pain, disability and other survey-based data from any individual with osteopetrosis, using a secure REDCap
platform. This registry will provide 1) long-term follow-up data continuing beyond the completion of this grant,
2) validation of the ADO2 clinical severity grading scale developed in Aim 1, and 3) be an additional ongoing
source of potential recruits to future studies using novel therapies."

Education plays a crucial role in harnessing the full potential of genetic and genomic science to enhance health
outcomes. However, it is challenging to attract and retain underrepresented students in biomedical sciences
who are interested in genetics and genomics. At Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), we recognize that
genomic education and training is a multifaceted process that involves numerous programs, institutes, and
agencies. Hence, the Genomics Workforce Development Core (GWDC) collaborates with MSM Centers of
Excellence in Genomic Science, MSM Institute of Translational Genomic Medicine, the Atlanta University
Center Data Science Initiative, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity
and Researcher Diversity, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 23andMe, the Institute
for Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Virginia School of Medicine to address this
issue. Aligned with NHGRI's Building a Diverse Genomics Workforce Action Agenda, the MSM GWDC is
committed to building three signature programs and funding opportunities that prioritize outreach and
recruitment based on the principles of ""Invest in Representation, Empowerment, and Training."" Our
overarching goals are to promote representation, empower individuals, and offer comprehensive genomics
training opportunities through outreach efforts, education initiatives, and an inclusive and supportive
environment for individuals from UR populations. The specific aims of the GWDC include the following: 1).
Increase knowledge and understanding of genomics among school-age children and their families, and
promote its importance in personal health, scientific discovery, and society via our new initiative GenoSquad;
2). Enhance the academic preparedness and genomic research skills of underrepresented undergraduate
students in our new GenoProdigy Scholar Pathway Program and 3) Establish a comprehensive GenoRising
Scholar training program to support the education and training of postdoctoral researchers in genomics,
including predoctoral and medical students. These programs will provide courses, seminars, workshops, and
experiential training for UR undergraduates, predoctoral students, medical students, and postdoctoral fellows.
These programs will provide courses, seminars, workshops, and experiential training for UR K-12 students,
their parents/caregivers, undergraduates, predoctoral students, medical students, and postdoctoral fellows and
trainees. With the help of our partners, the DCGR Administrative Core, Community Engagement Core, and the
Research Projects, each of these programs will be devised in a way that recognizes the key obstacles faced by
UR individuals and help them overcome these obstacles through innovative, academic, and nonacademic
strategies."
10883217,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a lifesaving treatment in the critically ill. However, MV also increases the risk
of acute kidney injury (AKI) 3-fold, independent of concurrent illnesses. The mortality associated with AKI during
MV is unacceptably high at over 50%, and treatment options are limited. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill
current gaps in knowledge of the mechanisms involved in AKI due to MV to identify novel pathways that may be
targets for future therapies.
 Pre-clinical models have demonstrated that MV leads to an instantaneous decrease in glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) and an increase in sodium retention. However, the exact mechanisms that contribute to these alterations
in kidney function have not been well described. For example, we do not know the physical changes in glomerular
function that lead to decreased GFR, or the alterations in tubule function that contribute to a decrease in natriuresis.
Understanding the mechanisms of these functional changes in kidney physiology and how they relate to the
development of structural kidney injury (i.e., cell injury and death) is imperative to the development of novel
treatments that may be lifesaving.
 In this proposal, a multi-disciplinary team of pulmonary and nephrology physician-scientists will conduct the
first thorough renal micropuncture assessment of glomerular and tubule function during MV to identify the
physiological changes that contribute to AKI. The first aim will identify the physical determinants of decreased GFR
during MV with and without lung injury induced by surfactant depletion. Renal nerve ligation will be used to
determine the mechanistic role of renal nerve stimulation as a target for future translational therapies. In the second
aim, the investigative team will evaluate the changes in sodium and electrolyte transport across the nephron
segments that contribute to sodium retention and volume overload during MV. Importantly, volume overload is
associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients treated with MV, and we hypothesize that volume overload
is in part driven by increased proximal tubule reabsorption of sodium via increased Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3)
activity. Thus, we will compare the effects of NHE3 inhibition to standard treatments with volume expansion and
loop diuretics on sodium reabsorption and volume overload during MV.
 Finally, the relationship between functional changes in glomerular and tubule function during MV and
structural AKI remain unclear. Structural AKI often occurs in the setting of low oxygen delivery relative to oxygen
consumption, and our pilot data suggest that increased oxygen consumption/GFR contributes to mitochondrial
injury and AKI. In the third aim, we will determine the effects of MV on kidney oxygenation, mitochondrial structure
and function, and structural AKI, including the effects of renal denervation, volume expansion, loop diuretics, and
NHE3 inhibition. Successful completion of these aims will provide a rationale for translational studies investigating
therapies targeting intrarenal hemodynamics and kidney tubule function and metabolism to prevent AKI during MV."
10883271,"This competing renewal continues the work of our first R01 (awarded in 2019) to better understand why
different mutations in the RNA-binding protein PUM1 cause two very different phenotypes. One is a mild, late-
onset ataxia, the other is a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome, although both fall under the rubric of
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 47 (SCA47). Interestingly, we were studying another SCA (SCA1) when we found
that PUM1 regulates the levels of the relevant protein, ataxin1. This was the first indication that PUM1,
previously known for its role in developing gametes, is important for neurological function in mice. PUM1 has
several mechanisms of action that it can use to regulate different targets, but in the case of ATXN1 it directly
binds to the 3'UTR to repress it. PUM1 heterozygous mice therefore develop an adult-onset ataxia very much
like SCA1, due to overproduction of ATXN1 in the cerebellum. PUM1 knockout mice are sicker, being small
from birth and born at lower Mendelian ratios. Crossing the PUM1 hets with SCA1 knockin mice exacerbates
the SCA1 phenotype, while crossing PUM1 hets with ATXN1 hets (who have no phenotype) rescues the PUM1
loss-of-function ataxia. These observations prompted us to look for human patients bearing PUM1 variants,
and we initially identified 15 individuals with either deletions or missense mutations. The most severe
mutations (deletion or R1147W, reducing PUM1 protein levels by ~50%) cause PADDAS (PUM1-associated
developmental delay and seizures); the mildest mutation (T1035S) reduces PUM1 by only 25% and causes
adult-onset PRCA (PUM1-related cerebellar ataxia). Although the phenotypic severity tracks with protein
dosage, the few PUM1 targets that were known at the time were upregulated to the same extent in cell lines
derived from PRCA and PADDAS patients. We therefore hypothesized that whereas the mild PRCA mutation
would primarily cause target dysregulation, the more severe PADDAS mutation disrupts PUM1's native
interactors in addition to their downstream targets. To test this dual hypothesis, over the past four years we
mapped PUM1 targets and interactors in the mouse brain (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus), finding
particularly strong interactions with ubiquitin ligases, mTOR, several RNA-binding proteins (FMRP, AGO2,
CNOT1, RBFOX3), and a number of mitochondrial proteins. Our studies in patient-derived cell lines and in
vitro experiments seem to bear out our dual hypothesis, but the crucial experiment now is to study PRCA and
PADDAS mouse models (which we have in hand) in order to understand the distinct pathogenic pathways for
each disease as well as to understand how PUM1 interactions support healthy brain function. We will therefore
characterize the PRCA and PADDAS mouse models, create molecular profiles of the targets and interactors that
are altered in each model, and determine the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the broad range of symptoms
that occur in PADDAS."

 Latinxs comprise a large and growing population in the US, but are typically underrepresented in study
samples, limiting statistical comparisons to only other racial or ethnic groups.1 Inadequate access to large,
diverse samples of Latinxs in public health research has led to treating Latinxs as a monolith, despite known
and important within-group differences.1–5 These conditions have led to inadequately tailored disease
prevention and control strategies1 and allowed for the persistence of health inequities such as those
experienced among Latinxs before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic compared to non-Latinx Whites8–
12,14 and even to all other racial-ethnic-sex groups.13,92 Yearby's revised Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
Framework explains that structural discrimination (e.g., racism, ethnocentrism, and sexism) is the underlying
cause of the inequitable distributions of economic, healthcare access, educational, social, and environmental
SDOH across populations, which ultimately results in disproportionate disease burden.19 Individuals hold
multiple identities (e.g., ethnic, racial, country of origin, gender, age, language) that interact with structural
discrimination in distinct ways,22–24 but how these identities interact with SDOH and SARS-CoV-2 testing and
vaccination outcomes within Latinxs is unknown. The present proposal harnesses Latinx-identifying participant
data (N = 31,372) from 10 purposively selected, geographically diverse Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for
Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) projects to overcome the limitations in prior research. Specifically, using
pooled Tier 1 common data elements for Aim 1, we will identify the relative importance of economic,
healthcare access, educational, and environmental SDOH on SARS-CoV-2 testing (e.g., engagement in
testing, testing access) and vaccination (e.g., vaccination status, reasons to/to not get vaccinated) outcomes
within a large, robust individual person data meta-analysis of Latinx US adults. Using the same Tier 1 data for
Aim 2, we will investigate how the Aim 1 model varies by race, country of origin, gender, age, and language.
Finally, for Aim 3, we will use Tier 2 data and employ scale equating data harmonization techniques to
examine additional identity-related moderators (e.g., immigration status), SDOH (e.g., racial discrimination,
food insecurity), and more robust measures of testing and vaccination outcomes that advance the Aim 1 and 2
models; and evaluate the degree to which the findings generalize to the national Latinx population. Study
findings will advance the empirical knowledge base necessary to design precise, culturally tailored prevention
and control strategies within Latinxs to reduce health inequities in COVID-19 and beyond."
10884886,"The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and advance behavioral assessment methods (BAM) to
measure spontaneous reach and grasp in infants and toddlers with and without hemiparetic cerebral palsy.
Reach and grasp are critical to promoting healthy development and active engagement with the environment.
This proposal focuses on the key period from 8 – 36 months of age when infants rapidly develop upper extremity
skills, mobility, cognition, and language; and when hemiparesis-specific treatments, such as constraint-induced
movement therapy, can be started. BAM will advance scientific knowledge about typical movements of the arms
and hands as well as altered movements in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy. This will yield a
standardized, objective metric that quantifies the distance between impaired and typical development and will
expand the precise measurement of treatment-induced recovery. This project includes prospective longitudinal
data obtained from typically developing infants and toddlers and leverages video-sharing and support from
StrokeNet’s Phase III randomized controlled trial of constraint-induced movement therapy.
 In AIM 1 we will develop the BAM Index using reach and grasp behaviors in 80 typically developing
infants/toddlers and 240 infants/toddlers with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke and hemiparetic cerebral palsy.
Videos will be coded for spontaneous reach and grasp frequency, duration, and exploratory behaviors with a
common set of objects. Multiple statistical models will be employed to develop four standardized BAM Indices.
 In AIM 2 we will (a) evaluate the changes of four BAM Indices with 1040 longitudinal videos from the
cohorts and (b) establish psychometric properties of the BAM Indices using: the Pediatric Stroke Outcome
Measure (Neurological deficit and function); Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (Gross Motor), Bayley Scales of
Infant and Toddler Development 4th edition (Fine Motor, Gross Motor, Language, and Cognition subscales), mini-
and Assisting Hand Assessment (paretic hand); parent-reported outcome measures (Infant Motor Activity Log,
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventories); and a combined clinical/parent outcome measure
(Emerging Behaviors Scale).
 This project has the potential to advance pediatric rehabilitation research by affording a novel, reliable,
precise, and sensitive measure of reach and grasp – applicable to hundreds of thousands of children with infant
stroke and hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Furthermore, the novel use of data sharing and video coding are
imperative for scientific reproducibility, reduction in cost, and will support the ability to improve health and
physical function in infants and toddlers with cerebral palsy and other physical disabilities."
10883397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macrophage fusion resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) accompanies a variety of
disorders associated with chronic inflammation, including the foreign body response (FBR) elicited by
implanted biomaterials. MGCs are a major factor contributing to long-term failures in human vascular
prosthetic grafts, pacemaker leads, and other implanted medical devices. Despite the long history of
research, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of macrophage fusion and, generally, cell-to-cell fusion
remain poorly understood. During the current funding period, we have shown that fibrin polymer, but not its
precursor, fibrinogen, deposited on the surface of implanted biomaterials, drives macrophage fusion. Our
preliminary in vitro studies found that fibrinogen deposited on the surface at its physiological concentration
does not support macrophage fusion, consistent with our previous findings that, upon contact with various
surfaces, fibrinogen undergoes self-assembly forming nonadhesive soft matrices. Surprisingly, although
the three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gel supports adhesion, it does not support fusion. However, removing the
gel, leaving a ""2D footprint"" consisting of fibrils attached to the rigid surface, restores macrophage fusion.
We hypothesize that adsorbed fibrinogen and deposited fibrin polymer form matrices with different
mechanical properties and surface patterns, which macrophages sense, initiating different
mechanotransduction responses. Specific Aim 1 is to determine why and how the fibrin polymer drives
macrophage fusion during the foreign body reaction to implanted biomaterials. Using cell signaling assays
with mechanosensitive molecules, ultrastructural studies, the hydrogels with different stiffness, and
micropatterned surfaces, we will examine differential sensing by macrophages of the mechanical properties
of 3D and 2D matrices prepared from wild-type and mutant fibrin(ogens) and characterize their
architectural features. The knowledge obtained will be translated into generating biomaterials with a
reduced ability to support macrophage fusion and testing their properties in vivo bioimplant models.
Specific Aim 2 will determine the cellular and molecular organization of the macrophage fusion site.
Following our finding that macrophage fusion is initiated by an actin-based protrusion and some preliminary
data, we hypothesize that a strong actin-propelled protrusion is formed at the leading edge of a donor
macrophage enriched in podosomes and situated within the interface restricted by zipper-forming proteins.
Taking advantage of our methodological platform consisting of high-resolution microscopy, live cell
imaging, mice with myeloid cell-specific knockouts, and macrophages with knockdowns of selected
regulators of branched actin network, we will determine the cellular and molecular determinants of the
fusion site and fusion pore formation. Overalls, these studies will define the novel biology of macrophage
fusion and characterize new mechanisms that have the potential to modulate the FBR."
10884290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adequate adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to suppress HIV viral loads among
individuals living with HIV, which is essential both for individual-level benefits and to prevent the onward
transmission of HIV. While newer ART regimens are better tolerated, have fewer side effects and a lower risk of
drug resistance than older regimens, treatment success nevertheless remains dependent on patient adherence.
Current approaches to identify inadequate adherence are either subjective or insensitive, whereas objective
markers of treatment exposure (drug levels) in hair, dried blood spots or plasma require expensive
instrumentation and are therefore not scalable. As the ultimate aim of treatment is to achieve HIV viral load
suppression, use of HIV viral load testing is being expanded worldwide. As it remains an expensive test, it is
often performed infrequently and therefore treatment failure is detected late, resulting in missed opportunities to
improve adherence. A low-cost point-of-care (POC) assay to assess adherence to ART, objectively at clinic
visits, in resource limited settings (RLS), could: 1) Provide immediate information on recent adherence which
can then be followed with appropriate adherence support; 2) Allow for more frequent assessment of adherence
and reinforcement of appropriate adherence behavior before virologic failure occurs; 3) Differentiate patients
with virological failure due to poor adherence from those with drug resistance. Finally, with the current roll-out of
tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (TLD) in RLS, failure rates are expected to be low and resistance rare,
necessitating a monitoring strategy primarily focused on identifying patients with inadequate adherence.
Recently the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Hair Analytical Laboratory and Abbott™ Rapid
Diagnostics has developed a urine-based immunoassay for tenofovir (TFV). This antibody-based assay detects
the presence of TFV in urine accurately, is easy-to-perform, and is both low-cost (< $2 dollars per test) and point-
of-care (POC), which allows for immediate adherence feedback to both patient and provider.
We will therefore conduct a study with the following aims: 1) Investigate the ability of the urine-based tenofovir
rapid assay (UTRA) to detect virologic failure in a cross-sectional study, along with the association of UTRA with
self-reported adherence and long term TFV exposure as measured in dried blood spots (120 patients); 2)
Qualitatively assess the acceptability of UTRA in patients (25) and health care workers (5); 3) Perform a pilot
randomized controlled study among adherence-challenged patients to investigate the usefulness, feasibility and
acceptability of UTRA-supported adherence counseling, compared to standard of care counseling, to impact
long-term HIV viral load outcomes (100 patients in each arm). The envisaged overall impact is that by study end,
we hope to have validated this novel real-time urine-based treatment adherence monitoring tool, in a resource-
limited setting, and inform a larger trial to trigger immediate adherence support and ration more expensive
laboratory testing, using the practical POC test, to improve long-term virologic outcomes worldwide."

Metformin has been used as a medication for the treatment of diabetes for approximately 70
years. Besides diabetes, biguanides are associated with a number of other beneficial effects
prevention/treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and weight
loss. Metformin has also been shown to increase health span and prolong life span. Despite
these wide-ranging pleotropic effects, the primary molecular mechanism of action is still
unresolved. Aging is arguably the single greatest risk factor for most diseases. This application
is based on the premise that deciphering metformin's molecular mechanism of action will
provide a better understanding of how the aging process and aging-related diseases may be
more effectively targeted. Based on extensive preliminary data and fundamental, yet often
underappreciated, thermodynamic and bioenergetic principles, the central hypothesis of this
project is that a mild reduction in mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency is the primary molecular
mechanism by which metformin, and other organic cations, extend health span and/or lifespan.
It is further hypothesized that the efficacy of metformin on health span depends on the chronic
metabolic state – beneficial under caloric surplus but detrimental under caloric deficit conditions.
State-of-the-art in vivo and in vitro approaches will be used: to establish the interaction of aging
and metformin (and other organic cations) on mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency in
mitochondria isolated from heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, intestine and brain from 3, 12,
and 24 month old Fischer 344 rats (Aim 1); to establish the acute interaction of metformin and
metabolic state (low or high fat diet, fed or fasted) in vivo in 12 month old rats (Aim 2); and to
determine the context specific impact of metformin on health span and lifespan in male and
female rats. The outcomes of this project are expected to demonstrate that metformin, similar to
other organic cations, dose-dependently decreases mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency,
revealing a primary mechanism that can account for the numerous downstream cellular and
physiological effects, including protection from aging-related diseases."

RBC alloimmunization in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can lead to potentially fatal hemolytic events.
Patients with SCD have the highest incidence of RBC alloimmunization, compared to all other disease
populations including those with similar transfusion burdens. Factors explaining this high incidence are poorly
understood. Identifying such factors would allow for identification of patients with SCD who may benefit from
personalized transfusion protocols and rare antigen-matched units. Inflammation in the transfusion recipient has
been shown to promote RBC alloantibody responses. We previously reported that proinflammatory type 1
interferons (IFNα/β) induced by viral infection or autoimmunity promote RBC alloimmunization in pre-clinical
transfusion models. Recent studies, including preliminary data included in this application, have revealed that
many patients with SCD have an IFNα/β gene signature, defined by leukocyte expression of IFNα/β stimulated
genes. However, mechanisms leading to IFNα/β activation, including signaling pathways, receptors, and ligands,
are poorly understood. Nearly all IFNα/β-inducing receptors are intracellular receptors for nucleic acids. Thus,
phagocytosis of nucleic acid containing cells, including reticulocytes which are elevated in SCD, has the potential
to activate IFNα/β pathways. Anti-RBC autoantibodies facilitate erythrophagocytosis, with alloimmunized
patients with SCD having an increased incidence of such autoantibodies. While the RBC alloantibody/RBC
autoantibody association is poorly understood, our preliminary data indicate that reticulocyte counts correlate
with IFNα/β gene scores and erythrophagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized reticulocytes from patients with
SCD induces IFNα/β activation in human macrophages. Preliminary data also show that anti-RBC autoantibodies
induce IFNα/β activation and RBC alloimmunization in a pre-clinical transfusion model.
In this proposal, we aim to test the hypothesis that RBC autoantibodies promote IFNα/β-mediated RBC
alloimmunization in SCD by identifying inflammatory pathways that induce IFNα/β (Aim 1) and determining the
effects of autoantibody-induced IFNα/β inflammation on RBC alloimmunization in SCD mice (Aim 2). In Aim 1,
IFNα/β pathways induced by autoantibodies will be identified in co-cultures of human macrophages and
reticulocytes from patients with and without SCD, and the extension of findings will be tested in pre-clinical murine
models. Identified pathways and receptors will inform ligands that induce IFNα/β in SCD. Aim 2 represents the
first investigation of IFNα/β-regulated RBC alloimmunization in pre-clinical models of SCD and has the potential
to reveal a mechanism that may contribute to the elevated incidence of RBC alloimmunization.
Long term goals of this project include improved understanding of proinflammatory interferons in SCD, with the
possibility that targeted IFNα/β-modulated therapy may be beneficial. Findings may also have applicability
beyond SCD, with inflammatory interferons playing a critical role in autoimmunity and other disease processes."
10882871,"Project Summary/Abstract
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by specific
autoantibodies and upregulation of interferon inducible genes but are not completely understood. We propose
a testable novel hypothesis in this K08 award to study the role of short interspersed elements (SINEs) in IIM.
SINEs occupy approximately 13% of the genome, are capable of forming double stranded RNA that leads to
activation of the innate immune system and production of interferons through MDA5 signaling. This is normally
prevented by ADAR1 which edits adenosine to inosine in RNA, thereby disrupting the double strandedness of
the structure. The long-term goal of this proposal is to achieve a better understanding of the underlying
molecular mechanisms of disease in IIM that may lead to better therapeutics with improved efficacy and lower
risk of adverse effects. This may additionally shed light on certain aspects of autoimmunity in general and the
specificity of autoantibodies. Aim 1 uses muscle data to study the transcriptome for evidence of SINE
overexpression and to quantify RNA editing in IIM and healthy controls. Aim 2 utilizes single cell analysis of the
transcriptome and epigenome to identify cell types that contribute the most to interferon production in
inflammatory myositis. Aim 3 correlates mutation detection and alternative splicing of ADAR1 and MDA5 with
interferon inducible genes. We expect this research plan to unveil novel biology in IIM. The candidate is an
MD/MPH rheumatologist at the University of Washington, with a background in immunology, statistics, and
computer programming, the proposed research and mentoring plans will ensure rigorous training in advanced
immunology, bioinformatics methodologies, and scientific communication to become a successful independent
scientist. Dr. Najjar is committed to a career in scientific research using bioinformatics tools to study complex
autoimmune disorders. The primary mentor is Dr Tomas Mustelin, MD, PhD who has mentored many scientists
throughout his career. The mentoring team will include additionally Dr Arnon Arazi, PhD as a co-mentor and Dr
Robert Bradley, PhD as a scientific advisor, both are experts in computational biology. The University of
Washington is an excellent environment for scientific research with advanced infrastructure for genomic
research. We will utilize the available genomic centers including that of Dr Michael Gale, PhD to study the
transcriptome and epigenome at the single cell level. The proposed multidisciplinary training program will
ensure Dr. Najjar's transition to an independent investigator."
10881299,"Highly aggressive cancers are frequently characterized by tumor cell emboli within the lymphatic and blood
vasculature. Termed lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), this phenomenon has been of high interest to
cancer researchers as it may represent one of the necessary events during progression from a localized to
metastatic cancer. Despite these biological implications, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that
directly enable and promote LVSI formation. Existing in vitro systems lack the multi-tissue and vascular
complexity to model these events. In vivo models, while available, are not amenable to mechanistic studies or
pharmacological screening because of the sheer number of animals required for such experiments. Therefore,
a critical need in the field is to develop models that can faithfully recreate specific phenomena related to
metastatic spread, such as LVSI. Using our novel, multi-cellular, vascularized 3D in vitro platform, we were able
to model intravasation of epithelial emboli and LVSI formation of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) ex vivo for
the first time. IBC is an aggressive breast cancer variant characterized by extensive LVSI. Gene expression data
from IBC patients identified stromal infiltration and activation as a critical component of LVSI. Using our new in
vitro platform and animal models, we were able to confirm this finding when we discovered that macrophages in
the microenvironment directly promote LVSI formation. Leveraging our new in vitro platform, we propose to
answer three major questions relating to LVSI: What mechanisms promote 1) formation, 2) migration, and 3)
intra-vessel survival of tumor emboli? We hypothesize that LVSI formation is a two-step process where matrix
properties and epithelial marker, E-cadherin which is strongly expressed in IBC, regulate tumor emboli formation
and survival, while the cytokine axis, CCR7/CCL21, homes epithelial emboli to lymphatics. To test this
hypothesis, we propose to use our new in vitro platform in three aims: 1) Determine the role of matrix mechanics
and lymphatic pumping in the temporal kinetics of LVSI, 2) Determine the role of E-cadherin in emboli formation
and survival, and 3) Identify the mechanisms that promote emboli homing to vasculature. Despite the strong
clinical evidence that LVSI is a critical, pre-metastatic phenomenon, our inability to fully recreate LVSI in vitro
has severely limited our mechanistic understanding of responsible pathways. For the first time, our team was
able to recreate LVSI ex vivo using a novel microfluidic platform. Here, we propose to use our in vitro platform
to define the signaling steps that promote LVSI formation and survival in vasculature to better define critical
targets related to cancer progression. To execute the proposal, we have assembled a team composed of experts
in tissue bioengineering, clinical research, and preclinical models of breast cancer. If successful, our work will
offer novel and customizable platforms for studying LVSI and new biological discoveries that hold therapeutic
potential for patients with advanced breast cancer."
10881304,"SUMMARY:
 Lynch Syndrome (LS) represents a hereditary predisposition syndrome associated with DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) pathway impairment. LS-associated tumors demonstrate a high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H),
and consequently a high mutational and neoantigen burden, which results in improved response to treatment
with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). We previously showed that frameshift (fs) mutations encoding
neoantigens in MSI-H tumors may control CPI efficacy and have quantifiably distinct characteristics from point
mutations such as (i) major divergence from self, leading to differential immunogenicity; (ii) shared expression
in MSI-H CRC tumors across patients; and (iii) expression of highly immunogenic epitopes that can elicit
neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells detectable in blood, a proxy for intratumoral activity. Pre-malignant LS lesions
are infiltrated with T cells expressing proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12), and CTLA-4, LAG3 and PD-L1
checkpoints suggesting early immune activation and recognition of tumor antigens. LS is therefore an ideal
setting for design of cancer prevention strategies, including vaccination, and identification of antigen-specific T
cell responses involved in immune surveillance and escape. We hypothesize that high quality shared
neoantigen expression and a functional T cell repertoire capable of trafficking to and clearing MMRd
lesions, deters progression of premalignant polyps to overt cancer in Lynch Syndrome. The goal of this
application is to dissect the landscape, quality, and evolution of neoantigens expressed within pre-malignant
colorectal polyps of LS patients, to track and identify immunogenic antigens that can be targets for prevention of
tumor development. The UG3 aims are: 1: Identification of neoantigens expressed in premalignant colon
polyps of Lynch Syndrome patients. We will map the spectrum of novel and shared neoantigen-expressing
frameshift mutations in pre-cancerous colorectal polyps. 2: Identification of fs-specific TCRs capable of
recognizing quality fs-neoantigens. We will confirm the immunogenicity of shared neoantigens expressed in
precancerous polyps and identify fs-specific T cell receptors (TCRs), including shared TCRs, by barcoded
peptide-MHC tetramers and single cell (sc)RNA/TCR sequencing from LS patient peripheral blood. The UH3
aims are to 1: Validate fs-neoantigen expression and tissue trafficking of fs-specific TCRs in a separate
validation cohort. 2: Assess the influence of prior MSI-H cancer on shared fs-neoantigen repertoire and T
cell recognition in subsequent colon lesions. We will determine whether prior exposure to shared MSI-H fs-
neoantigens through their expression in non-colonic sites shapes new colonic lesions and T cell surveillance, as
a model of “pre-vaccination”. 3: Assess fs-specific T cell exhaustion and co-localization with
immunosuppressive hubs in advanced precancerous lesions. Using bulk/scRNAseq, spatial
transcriptomics, and multiplexed immunohistochemistry we will determine mechanisms of immune escape in the
PME to identify checkpoints for future immunoprevention strategies."

This proposal seeks financial aid for acquiring a Zeiss Axioscan 7 high-performance microscope slide scanner to enhance
our research and educational capabilities at Howard University. Currently, our university relies solely on an obsolete
Nikon Ti-E PFS inverted scope, our only operational confocal microscope, which unfortunately offers outdated features
and underperforms. The Axioscan 7, Zeiss's latest advanced imaging system, provides a range of scanning microscopy
capabilities, including fluorescence, brightfield, and polarization microscopy. Its features make it essential for a variety of
applications, especially in biomedical research and education, aligning with our institution's mission to lessen health
disparities and advocate health equity among underrepresented groups. The proposed Axioscan 7 Slide Scanner will be
housed and managed by the Howard University Imaging Core (HUIC), a facility with over 25 years of experience in
leading preclinical imaging research on campus. The HUIC will maintain a dedicated lab for the scanner, employing
experts for supervision, training, and maintenance. The HUIC Special Purpose Fund will handle its long-term
administrative requirements. This setup encourages interdisciplinary collaborations, provides cost savings for individual
grants and investigators, stimulates budding scientists with advanced imaging, and facilitates understanding of diseases
predominantly affecting minority and disadvantaged groups. Our Major and Minor Users, many already funded by the
NIH, eagerly await the Axioscan 7 for their research and educational initiatives. The scanner will expedite studies in areas
such as traumatic brain injury, the effects of opioids on respiratory depression, gene delivery of immunotoxin in head and
neck carcinoma, congenital cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, among others. For education, it will offer invaluable hands-on
experience to students in advanced imaging techniques, AI-assisted histopathological analysis, and a summer oral health
program. This project has full institutional supports for housing, personnel, and additional management funds, if required.
Its use and maintenance will be overseen by the Equipment Oversight Advisory Committee. The Axioscan 7 acquisition
will fortify our research infrastructure, attract more academic professionals and students, foster racial equity in STEM,
and resonate with Howard University's commitment to improving minority health outcomes via enhanced contributions to
health sciences."
10880300,"Project Summary
The objective of this proposal is to develop targeted therapies for venous malformations (VMs). VMs are slow-
flow vascular lesions associated with disfigurement, pain, and functional impairment. Recently, systemic
inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with sirolimus has proven efficacious for treating
children with complex VMs. However, systemic drug delivery is associated with side effects that limit treatment.
Therefore, safe, targeted therapies that minimize systemic toxicity are required.
The proposed project will develop nanoparticulate (NP) targeted drug delivery systems to achieve high local
drug concentration in VMs while minimizing systemic distribution. This will be achieved by virtue of enhanced
permeation and retention (EPR), a well-recognized phenomenon in cancer biology whereby leaky tumor
vasculature allows for preferential uptake of nanoparticles compared to uptake in tissues with normal
vasculature. Passive NP accumulation within VMs, due to EPR, will be enhanced with active targeting
techniques, such as photo-targeting. The surfaces of NPs will be coated with molecules that encourage cell
uptake. These molecules will be inactivated with a “caging group,” a reversibly bound molecule that is sensitive
to a specific wavelength of light. Upon irradiation with light, the caging molecule will be removed from the NP.
Therefore, NPs can be systemically injected and remain unbound to tissues. However, irradiation of the VM will
cause “uncaging” to occur, which will activate the NPs, and allow for enhanced NP binding and drug release at
the target site.
To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Formulation and characterization
of NPs with prolonged dwell times in VMs. Specific Aim 2: Study of targeted NP drug delivery systems
in vivo. Specific Aim 3: Study of NP drug delivery systems on therapeutic efficacy in vivo. With the
guidance and mentorship of Dr. Daniel Kohane, Dr. Cullion has developed a five- year career development
plan to provide the mentored research, technical skill development, and didactic training needed to achieve her
goals of (1) becoming an expert in nanomedicine and drug delivery for the treatment of VMs and (2) achieving
scientific independence and becoming an R01 funded physician-scientist with a career in translational research
focused on nanomedicine and drug delivery for vascular anomalies."

10880306,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cerebrovascular disease is the third leading killer in the U.S., and contributes to decreased quality of
life and increased long-term care spending. The risk of cerebrovascular disease is inversely
associated with resting cerebral blood flow (CBF). Men exhibit a lower resting CBF and have twice
the risk of cerebrovascular disease when compared to premenopausal women. The ability of cerebral
vessels to respond to challenges is also inversely related to disease risk, and may be useful in
identifying at-risk patients pre-clinically. However, these studies are often confounded by aging and/or
comorbidities, and the associations provide little insight into physiologic mechanisms responsible for
sexually dimorphic cerebrovascular disease risk. Conversely, animal studies use supraphysiologic
levels of hormone treatment in primarily young animals, which limits the translational relevance of
animal CBF mechanisms. While there is general agreement that estrogen is protective in healthy
adults, the basic impact of sex, and physiologic fluctuations in sex hormones, on mechanisms of CBF
control remains unclear. The overall goal of this research program is to investigate the mechanisms
which actively control cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans, particularly how men and women differ in
control mechanisms on a regional basis throughout the brain circulation. We propose to study CBF
control mechanisms in healthy younger (18-40 yrs) adult men and women. The overall hypothesis is
that female sex and sex hormones contribute to larger stress-induced increases in CBF, due to
greater prostanoid (COX) and nitric oxide (NOS) dilation. A key technological innovation of this
proposal derives from multi-mode, high-resolution, flow sensitive MRI to quantify CBF at macro- and
microvascular levels, at rest, and in response to environmental challenges. Additionally, the research
design allows us to quantify sex differences in two vascular control mechanisms across all brain
regions. Our preliminary data demonstrate: hypoxic cerebral vasodilation is 60-100% higher in
women compared to men, COX inhibition reduces dilation in women but not men, NOS inhibition
reduces vasodilation more in women, and hypoxic vasodilation is increased in women during early
luteal cycle, in part to greater COX-mediated vasodilation. We also will use sex hormone
suppression, followed by single hormone addition, to systematically study the impacts on CBF control
in both sexes. We have substantial preliminary findings that support our hypotheses, and have
integrated physiologic, pharmacologic, and MRI approaches to test our hypotheses. This state-of-the-
art approach will yield previously unattainable insight into not only maintaining CBF, but actively
controlling it during physiologic demands for increased flow. These novel, high resolution, regionally-
specific, sex-specific, and mechanism-specific findings will serve as a knowledge platform, for
designing sex-specific CBF studies in high risk disease populations (e.g. diabetes, hypertension,
Alzheimer’s) which exhibit strong sex-specific etiology and important vascular contributions."
10878862,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the US. Many cigarette smokers have
taken up e-cigarettes hoping to reduce their health risks. Yet, more than half of the 11 million current e-
cigarette users in the US continue to smoke combustible cigarettes. Contrary to what these dual users of
cigarettes and e-cigarettes may expect, replacing only some combustible cigarette use with e-cigarettes
appears to have little health benefit—dual users are exposed to many toxins at similar or higher levels than
exclusive cigarette smokers. Dual users need to be informed of their continued risk from smoking combustible
cigarettes as well as the known harms of e-cigarettes. They should be encouraged to quit cigarettes and
ultimately e-cigarettes. Helping smokers end use of combustible tobacco is central to FDA's new
comprehensive plan for nicotine and tobacco. No research exists, however, on how to create communication
campaign messages specifically for dual cigarette and e-cigarette users.
 In this project, my goal is to develop communication campaign messages for dual users that increase their
knowledge of the high health risk of dual use and increase their intent to quit combustible cigarettes and
ultimately e-cigarettes. Aim 1 develops effective campaign messages by investigating how dual users think
about their identity, motivations for tobacco product use, and the barriers to quitting combustible cigarettes. I
first use focus groups to understand dual users and gather concepts for messages. Using these findings and
existing literature, I then draft 50-75 potential campaign messages for dual users to encourage them to quit,
and use a national survey with 1,008 adults to select the most promising campaign message themes. Aim 2
determines whether campaign ads are more engaging if they focus on quitting combustible cigarettes only,
sequentially quitting cigarettes and e-cigarettes, or simultaneously quitting cigarettes and e-cigarettes. I create
visual ads for the messages from Aim 1 and use an eye-tracking experiment to determine how the different
conditions affect attention among dual users. Aim 3 pilot tests the effectiveness of campaign ads sent via
texting in changing real-world combustible cigarette and e-cigarette quit intention among dual users.
 The proposed research and training move me toward my career goal of becoming an independent
behavioral scientist advancing health communications that support tobacco regulations. I will learn the applied
theory of the psychology of identity and persuasion, the content areas of nicotine and cessation science, and
the skills of eye-tracking methodology and message development and testing. The grant's findings will be
directly relevant to communication about cigarettes and e-cigarettes and will also add to the broader tobacco
communication science. The K01 will inform an R01 proposal for a full-scale RCT testing the effectiveness of
campaign ads for dual users to encourage them in quitting."

The Program in Neuroscience (PiN) at the University of Maryland Baltimore is a broad-based, non-departmental
multidisciplinary program that provides contemporary predoctoral training with exceptional trainee outcomes in
the discipline of neuroscience. This interdisciplinary program consists of 57 students and 117 faculty from 14
departments and 3 schools. The 60 Training Grant faculty are representative of the breadth of research which
spans molecular and cellular to systems and behavior to translational work. The long-standing JSPTPN training
program (16yrs) is integral to the success of PiN. Serving as the nexus that connects all aspects of neuroscience
at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), it continues to drive the program’s excellence in training and
research. Our mission is to provide a center of excellence for the training of outstanding graduate students in
the field of neuroscience. The program currently supports 6 PiN students in years 1 & 2. In the current application
we are requesting a total of 8 training positions per year (an increase of 2). The request is warranted by (1) our
excellent training outcomes where students graduate within 5.5 years with an average of 2 first author
publication, 44% obtain independent training research grants and 95% of PiN graduates continue in research-
intensive/science-related careers; (2) our highly qualified training grant eligible and underrepresented group
applicant pool and (3) the unprecedented growth of neuroscience research at UMB that includes a marked
increase in the number neuroscience faculty. Modern neuroscience is evolving and growing at an unparalleled
pace especially in technological and analytic advances. Thus, our objective is to train excellent scientists who,
in addition to having the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary to adapt to the rapidly growing and
technologically evolving field of neuroscience research, will also have the confidence to be leaders in the field.
To this end, the foundation of graduate training in PiN has been built upon four critical components: (i) a strong
foundation in core neuroscience concepts (ii) emphasis on critical thinking skills, (iii) a deep understanding of
experimental design, quantitative analysis and hypothesis testing and (iv) mentored career development. These
four components are interwoven into all stages of the program’s training plan and continue to serve as the
keystone to excellence in training. In the present renewal, we have continue to evolve our training program to
incorporate (1) innovated teaching of experimental design, quantitative analysis and hypothesis testing through
neuroscience centric problem-based learning and neuromodeling opportunities; (2) novel course designs such
as the “Nano Courses”; (3) mentored laboratory rotations that require oral research presentations and (4)
enhanced career development skills through mentoring and the established Office of Career Development. The
stable funding of the faculty and the success of our students speaks to the strength of our graduate training
efforts and that continued funding for our program is well justified. With continued support, the faculty and
students in PiN can continue to spearhead the effort of multidisciplinary neuroscience at UMB."

Access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is not equitable. Black and Hispanic individuals are
substantially less likely to receive MOUD and other overdose prevention services. The overdose death rate
has risen nearly twice as fast for Black individuals as for White individuals in recent years, a disparity that
appears to have widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Racial/ethnic inequities in receipt of MOUD are
rooted in the structural racism ingrained in policies governing healthcare, housing, social services, criminal
justice and other systems. As the largest single payer for MOUD and a key source of coverage for racial/ethnic
minority groups, Medicaid is well-positioned to address inequities in MOUD. Although they have not done so to
date, Medicaid agencies can adopt policies to alter (a) financial incentives for MOUD providers, and (b)
contracts with managed care plans to improve equity in MOUD. Medicaid programs could institute
requirements for provider networks; invest in building capacity for minority-serving Medicaid providers to
deliver MOUD; include equity measures in provider performance measurement; and alter managed care
contracts to incentivize plans to address inequities in MOUD. There is, however, little evidence on which of
these levers is most likely to be effective. To inform Medicaid policy development, we harness the Medicaid
Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN), which is made up of university partnerships with Medicaid
agencies in 11 states representing 22% of all US Medicaid enrollees. MODRN is currently funded by NIDA to
study the quality of opioid use disorder treatment in Medicaid and has developed analytic infrastructure to
conduct multi-state analyses of treatment with MOUD in Medicaid. We propose analyses that examine the role
of place, providers, plans and policies in driving racial/ethnic inequities in MOUD. First, we examine
racial/ethnic inequities in geographic access to MOUD providers among Medicaid enrollees. Second, we
examine the contribution of provider- and plan-level factors to racial/ethnic equity in MOUD. Third, we estimate
the association between state policies aimed at (a) changing delivery system reforms, and (b) managed care
contracts, and equity in MOUD. Study outcomes are any use of MOUD and continuity of MOUD, both of which
are associated with reduced mortality. We will use geospatial analyses, multi-level modeling, and difference-in
difference analyses to accomplish our specific aims. Long-standing relationships with state Medicaid officials
allow us to share findings directly with policymakers who can act on them. MODRN facilitates rapid knowledge
transfer from researchers to policymakers, allows state Medicaid agencies to benchmark their performance on
racial/ethnic equity in MOUD against other states, and supports state agencies learning from one another
about the most effective policy levers for improving equity in MOUD."
10880525,"The vascular endothelium's principal responsibility is to support the inflammatory and metabolic 
needs of each of the body's organ systems. As such, these cells are highly sensitive to 
environmental cues and must be able to respond in a precise manner. The regulation of these 
responses likely occurs via numerous competing pathways. Of particular importance are the fluid 
shear stress forces imparted by blood flow. The mechanosensitive transcription factors KLF2 and 
KLF4 compete with other mechanosensitive transcription factors such as NF-kB and SMAD2/3 to 
suppress inflammation and vessel remodeling. Defects in the coupling between these competing 
pathways can cause vascular malformations. Klf2/4 are transcriptionally regulated by a MAPK-complex 
consisting of the kinases MEKK2/3, MEK5, and ERK5, and the scaffold protein p62. Importantly, the 
p62-MAPK-Klf2/4 axis is activated by high shear but suppressed by low shear to permit low 
shear-induced inflammation and remodeling. Besides the MAPKs, p62 also interacts with mitochondrial 
proteins and polyubiquitinated proteins. As mitochondrial remodeling and proteotoxic stress 
responses have been implicated in both shear responses and p62 signaling, this project will explore 
the possibility that shear-dependent changes to mitochondrial or ubiquitin homeostasis acts as a 
key regulator of p62-MAPK signaling. In aim 1 we will test shear-dependent changes to mitochondrial 
function and the role of mitochondria in regulating 
p62-MAPK-Klf2/4 signaling. In aim 2 we characterize shear-dependent changes to the ubiquitinome, 
determine its role in regulating p62-MAPK-Klf2/4 signaling, and the role of ubiquitin homeostasis 
regulating crosstalk between mechanotransduction pathways. The results obtained in this project 
will provide insight into the regulation of homeostatic mechanotransduction pathways and may reveal 
genetic and environmental drivers of KLF2-4-associated pathologies."

Nearly 70% of the ~ 30 million adult cigarette smokers in the US want to quit, and 55% report trying to quit at
least once in the past year - yet, over 90% fail despite using smoking cessation medication. The average smoker
will attempt to quit smoking at least 30 times before abstaining for 12 months or longer. These attempts typically
occur over decades of smoking, carcinogen and toxicant exposure, resulting in 480,000 deaths annually. Novel
alternatives must be considered to significantly reduce the combustible cigarette-attributable morbidity and
mortality among smokers unable to quit with traditional approaches. The Surgeon General’s Report and others
have underscored that helping smokers who cannot quit smoking switch to less harmful nicotine-containing
products – a harm reduction approach - can dramatically reduce this health burden. E-cigarettes (ECIGS), and
oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), expose users to few of the chemicals found in cigarette smoke and are thus
promising noncombustible harm reduction tools for smokers who would not otherwise quit smoking. For their
harm reduction potential to be realized, fundamental questions must be answered. One, can persistent
smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to either ECIGS or ONPS? Initial research suggests that one-
third of smokers fully switch to ECIGS, although comparable data is unavailable for ONPS. Two, what factors
influence switching? The factors affecting the transition to ECIGS or ONPS have yet to be investigated. Three,
does one of these noncombustible alternatives expose users to lower levels of harmful chemicals than
the other? Only limited, indirect, and industry-sponsored data exist. Documenting the relative success of
switching to ECIGS or ONPS, identifying drivers of switching, and quantifying the associated harm reduction will
inform research to optimize smokers’ success in transitioning from combustible cigarettes.
We propose the first longitudinal investigation of the substitutability of ECIGS versus ONPS for
combustible cigarette smoking, factors that impact switching, and their potential to serve as harm
reduction tools. Persistent cigarette smokers (n=200) motivated to switch from combustible cigarettes will be
randomized to a six-week regimen of ECIGS or ONPS. Baseline smoking rate will be established during days 1-
5. Laboratory visits on days 6 and 7 will assess ECIG and ONP-associated subjective reward and the reinforcing
value of either ECIGS or ONPS relative to combustible cigarettes. Participants will then switch from cigarette
smoking to ECIGS or ONPS for six weeks. The primary outcome measure is the longitudinal daily count of
cigarettes from baseline to the end of the six-week switch period and at 26 weeks follow-up (secondary endpoint).
Changes in biomarkers of potential harm, assessed at baseline and the end of the six-week switch phase, will
be secondary outcome measures. The proposed study aligns with the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI, NOT-
OD-22-023) for “studies of how ENDS use influences smoking and harm reduction studies that involve switching
from combustible cigarettes to electronic nicotine delivery systems … and alternative nicotine delivery systems.”"

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are nuclear receptors (NRs) that switch from transcriptional repressors to
activators in response to thyroid hormone (TH), a powerful regulator of lipid and energy metabolism.
Repression is mediated by NR corepressors NCOR1 and NCOR2/SMRT, which function in multiprotein
complexes containing histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), whose catalytic activity requires interaction with
NCOR1/2. This proposal focuses on mechanisms by which TH controls liver metabolism as well as non-
canonical metabolic functions of NCOR1/2 and HDAC3. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the molecular
mechanisms and role of thyroid hormone action in physiology and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). TRb agonists have great promise in the treatment of NASH, but the mechanisms by which they
alleviate fatty liver, inflammation, and fibrosis are unclear. Preliminary data in mouse models demonstrate that
many TH-regulated genes are dysregulated in NASH livers, with evidence of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism.
We will use novel epitope-tagged TRb mice, functional genomics, and genomic region-specific proximity
labelling to determine the mechanisms by which TH-regulated genes are dysregulated in NASH. Our
preliminary data has also uncovered regulation of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism by both NASH and TH, and
shown that TH upregulates anti-inflammatory kynurenine (Kyn) metabolites downstream of Trp. We will use
metabolic flux analysis to understand these changes, and will determine the importance of Kyn metabolites in
the improvement of NASH by TH. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate the physiological functions of nuclear
receptor corepressors in the liver. Preliminary data reveal that, in addition to repression of lipogenic genes,
NCORs unexpectedly activate gluconeogenic genes via an unrecognized chromatin opening ability. We
hypothesize that this is due to recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and will test this by utilizing a functional
genomics approach, including ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq combined with ChIP-mass spec in novel
mice with epitope-tagged NCORs. We will also use genomic region-specific proximity labelling to identify
proteins that interact specifically with NCORs at positively regulated genes. In addition we will determine the
mechanism underlying the regulation of gluconeogenesis by NCORs in the normal fasting response. Specific
Aim 3 is to determine the mechanisms underlying enzyme-independent functions of HDAC3 in the liver.
In liver, catalytically inactive HDAC3 can repress de novo lipogenesis and prevent hepatosteatosis, but the
mechanisms are not known. We will test the hypothesis that this is due to novel protein interactions by
combining functional genomics and proteomics using tagged wild type and mutant HDAC3. These innovative
studies address major questions regarding the mechanisms of action of TRs, corepressors, and HDAC3 and
will shed new light on the transcriptional and epigenomic control of metabolism in physiology as well as NASH
and related metabolic disorders."

Limited approaches exist to examine longitudinal changes in the structural and biochemical properties of tissues
under various physiological conditions such as pregnancy. Light and light based technologies offer the potential
for non-invasive, real-time, in vivo monitoring of longitudinal shifts in tissue physiology in response to
developmental, hormonal, or environmental influences. The objective of the proposed research is to pursue a
multi-pronged platform with complementary Raman scattering approaches to study longitudinal changes in tissue
physiology in vivo as well as ex vivo and compare the results with conventional assays to validate our approach.
In addition, we will combine various forms of in vivo Raman imaging, including (i) dual wavelength, dual region
Raman (ii) polarization-sensitive Raman, and (iii) resonance Raman spectroscopy to quantitatively analyze
changes in tissue physiology. In response to a lack of detailed understanding of preterm birth and its tissue
biochemistry, our group has reported the utility of in vivo RS to detect and extract longitudinal biochemical
changes in the mouse as well as human cervix, a tissue that undergoes extensive remodeling over the course
of pregnancy. We established the ability of a conventional in vivo RS probe to identify significant spectral changes
in collagen, elastin, water, and blood. Moreover, we can correlate these Raman spectra with changes in
biomechanical properties of the mouse cervix, including stiffness and distensibility, as the cervical tissue
undergoes normal remodeling/maturation in preparation for labor. Building on our prior research, the present
proposal will focus multimodal ex vivo and in vivo Raman approaches to gain in-depth, quantitative information
during physiologic cervical maturation and in mouse models of premature remodeling. We hypothesize that
multimodal Raman approaches will enable detection of key biochemical changes, such as extracellular matrix
(ECM) organization, tissue hydration, lipid and protein influx and vascularity that will allow molecular and
structural phenotyping of the cervix as a prototype of physiologic tissue remodeling. Results will be correlated
with spatial information obtained via ex vivo imaging and biomechanical testing. Our Aims are to: 1) Implement
multimodal non-linear imaging to characterize changes in structural proteins in the mouse cervix, 2) Use dual
wavelength, dual region Raman Spectroscopy to track changes in tissue hydration and lipid dynamics, and 3)
Evaluate spatial and temporal changes in blood and vascularization in the mouse cervix over the course of
pregnancy. Ultimately, this project will integrate the results of these aims to provide a more complete picture of
the molecular and structural changes that can be used to understand normal as well as compromised
pregnancies. The resultant in-depth biomolecular profiles and spatial tissue maps obtained for normal term and
preterm pregnancies with the innovative Raman approaches will provide vital information about the mechanism
of premature cervical remodeling and for monitoring longitudinal changes in the structural and biochemical
properties of other tissues with RS."

Cilia, microtubule-based organelles found on nearly all eukaryotic cells, coordinate numerous signaling cascade
that are essential for vertebrate development and disease. Mutations in primary cilia are associated with
numerous cardiovascular defects, most notably major congenital heart diseases (CHD). Further, ciliary defects
are known to cause heterotaxy, a human disorder of abnormal left-right (LR) asymmetric body patterning that
commonly affects the heart and is tightly correlated with CHD. During embryogenesis, proper LR asymmetric
development requires motile cilia that move in a coordinated fashion to generate the initial signal to break LR
symmetry: leftward flow of extra-embryonic fluid in a structure called the “left-right organizer” (LRO). Although
leftward flow in the LRO is necessary and sufficient for LR development, how this flow is sensed and transduced
into phenotypic LR asymmetry remains unclear. Strikingly, we have generated preliminary data in the zebrafish
LRO that suggests immotile cilia may function as calcium-signaling compartments that coordinate downstream
Nodal signaling via gap junctions during LR development. To elucidate this potential mechanism, we propose
three scientific aims that combine state-of-the-art in vivo microscopy, optogenetic tools, machine learning data
analysis approaches, zebrafish genetics and molecular embryology. In Aim 1, we will combine light-sheet
microscopy and optogenetic actuators to regulate calcium dynamics in the LRO of zebrafish. Combined with new
quantitative machine learning analysis tools, this approach will enable us to definitively address whether intra-
ciliary calcium signaling is sufficient and instructive for LR development. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
molecular machinery that underlies cilia-mediated calcium signaling in LR development. Specifically, we will
examine how the Pkd1l1-Pkd2 polycystin complex interact with one another to mediate calcium signaling in the
zebrafish LRO. In Aim 3, we will investigate how cilia-mediated calcium signaling is transduced from the cilium
to the cytoplasm by Invs, a calcium binding protein which localizes to the base of LRO cilia and is required for
LR development. Completion of these studies will resolve the role of the cilium as mechanosensitive antennae
that sense and translate extra-embryonic fluid flow into calcium signals that build the LR axis and lead to a
greater understanding of the mechanisms that drive situs of the heart."

The hematopoietic system is very sensitive to a variety of stresses. Radiation therapy commonly results in not
only acute hematopoietic suppression but also long-term bone marrow (BM) injury with increased risk of BM
failure or malignancy. Accumulation of damages during aging process is another type of stress on HSCs.
Enhancing HSC survival and maintaining their genomic integrity upon stress are crucial for preservation of HSC
self-renewal function and for protection against stress-induced BM injury. However, the underlying molecular
mechanisms are not well defined. No effective treatment has been developed to prevent or treat stress-induced
HSC damages and related pathological consequences. The primary goal of this project is to identify novel
pharmaceutical compounds and transcriptional mechanism that target a HSC stress regulatory protein, latexin
(Lxn), and to uncover the mechanisms that Lxn suppression results in radiation protection and HSC rejuvenation.
We have identified a novel Lxn inhibitor small compound and found that it significantly increases survival by
protecting HSCs via a newly identified canonical mechanism of carboxypeptidase A inhibition upon radiation.
Lxn deletion also mitigates aging-related functional decline of HSCs. We hypothesize that pharmaceutical and
transcriptional suppression of Lxn protects HSCs and blood system from stress (radiation and aging)-induced
functional decline via the upregulation of canonical CPA3 pathway. Aim 1 is to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which Lxn inactivation protects against radiation-induced BM injury via up-regulation of canonical
CPA3 pathway. Aim 2 is to identify the mechanism of action of Lxn lead inhibitor in radiation protection of
hematopoietic system. Aim 3 is to define the role of Lxn suppression in rejuvenating old HSCs. Findings will
advance our knowledge of novel mechanisms how Lxn regulates stress hematopoiesis. Results will provide a
compelling starting point and lay grounds for the novel drug discovery by targeting Lxn, which will benefit patients
subject to radiation treatment and old people with dysfunctional HSC and immune aging."

Understanding how neuronal computations build up a perception of the external world is fundamental to our
understanding of how the brain works. This is particularly relevant to sensory systems, where heterogenous
inputs representing distinct sensory features must be re-assembled to generate a perception. How individual
neurons in early stages of sensory circuits process parallel inputs, and how these circuit elements later contribute
to cortical computations that bind the inputs together is completely unknown. Studies have demonstrated that
the timing, position and strength of a given input along the dendrite of a given neuron is a critical strategy used
by the brain to encode sensory features. However, how such dendritic integrations of inputs in single neurons
contribute to an animal's overall perception is not understood.
To re-assemble diverse features from the same initial stimulus, the brain needs to determine which features
occurred at the same time. Currently, little is known about how or where this timing information might be encoded.
The auditory system offers an ideal system to tackle this question based on its tractability to interdisciplinary
methods and its known ability to encode even miniscule differences in timing. Specifically, we will take advantage
of a unique cell type in the auditory cochlear nucleus, called octopus cells, as a model to investigate the question
of how small cell classes contribute to behavioral and perceptual circuits. Octopus cells are prominent in all
mammalian species and are well known to encode temporal inputs with submillisecond precision through
integration of primary sensory inputs along their large and extensive dendrites. We propose to carry out a multi-
lab, integrated analysis of the molecular and biophysical properties of octopus cells and to track how these single
cell computations are transformed along the auditory pathway to contribute to an animal's final auditory percept
and hence behavior. Using the mouse as a model system, we will apply new sequencing methods together with
high resolution brain imaging and single cell reconstructions to create a comprehensive wiring diagram of
octopus cells and their auditory inputs. By generating mouse strains for selective access to octopus cells, we will
be ideally positioned to investigate the in vitro and in vivo physiology of octopus cells and therefore bridge
experimental and computational models for how timing information is encoded at the single cell level. Lastly, we
will study how timing information propagates to higher auditory centers by recording from large populations of
neurons in the midbrain, thalamus, and cortex and then assessing the functional relevance of temporal coding
for auditory behavior. By leveraging molecular, biophysical, electrophysiological, behavioral, and computational
approaches toward the study of this model cell type, these studies will allow us to extract general principles of
single cell computations and their effects on systems-level circuit function, with broad implications for
understanding how parallel streams of information are integrated to generate sensory perception."
10879154,"Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions in the world. Treatment with anti-epileptic
drugs (AEDs) prevent recurrent seizures in ~70% of patients with epilepsy, but the remaining 30% of patients
with refractory epilepsies continue to experience uncontrolled seizures. The negative consequences of repeated
seizures include post-ictal cardiorespiratory suppression putting these patients at high risk of Sudden
Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Fundamental knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of how
repeated seizures disrupt the vital cardiorespiratory control systems in the brain. A factor commonly identified in
many neurological conditions including epilepsy is neuroinflammation, which supports beneficial functions in
health but is dysregulated in epilepsy patients and animal models of seizure disorder. Key cells within the CNS
mediating pathological neuroinflammation are resident microglia and astrocytes, which have also been shown
to be dysfunctional in human epilepsy. However, it is not known what mechanistic role the glial-derived
neuroinflammation plays in the impairment of cardiorespiratory control or increased SUDEP risk. Here, I
hypothesize that repeated seizures lead to activation of neuroinflammation mediated by microglia within
key brainstem regions controlling cardiorespiratory function causing a progressive decline in these vital
functions. Published and preliminary data in our novel rat model with genetic mutations in a gene (kcnj16)
encoding an inwardly-rectifying potassium ion channel (Kir5.1; SSkcnj16-/- rats) show that repeated sound-induced
seizures (1/day for up to 10 days) lead to progressively more severe post-ictal cardiorespiratory suppression and
unexpected mortality particularly in male rats. Through snRNA sequencing and bioinformatic pathway analyses
of transcriptomic changes specifically within microglial cells in the medullary raphe (key breathing control region)
identified significant predicted activation of IL-1ß signaling following repeated seizures, consistent with
immunofluorescent brainstem tissue analyses. Here I propose two Specific Aims which: 1) characterize cell-
specific transcriptomic shifts in gene expression within key cardiorespiratory control regions to identify key cells
types and pathways mediating local neuroinflammation leading to neuronal dysfunction, and 2) functionally test
the roles of microglia and IL-1 signaling in the brain in mediating the progressive cardiorespiratory suppression
and/or unexpected seizure-induced mortality. Identifying neuroinflammatory signals/pathways induced by
repeated seizures within distinct neural circuits in our novel rat model will enhance our understanding of the
pathophysiological consequences of uncontrolled seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy, and hold the
potential for identifying new therapeutic targets aimed at preventing seizure-induced cardiorespiratory
dysfunction function and reduce SUDEP risk."
10879157,"Project Summary
Public health efforts in adolescence aimed at life course physical health promotion have to date focused almost
exclusively on addressing physiological risk factors and health behaviors (e.g., weight, smoking, etc.). This
proposal examines a far-reaching hypothesis with the potential to open up new venues for intervention: that
social relationship qualities established in adolescence have an integral, long-term relationship to life course
physical health and aging processes.
The proposed study will clarify both the existence and the mechanisms by which two specific relationship
qualities in adolescence—experience of hostile conflict and absence of supportive relationships—are linked to
midlife health and aging outcomes. It uses uniquely rich longitudinal data on peer, romantic partner, and family
relationship qualities across a 25-year span, to address four overarching aims: 1) direct prediction of midlife
health & aging from adolescent social relationship qualities; 2) assessment of mediational vs. weathering
explanations of links from adolescence to midlife health & aging outcomes; 3) examination of mediation of
adolescent-midlife linkages via mental health and health behaviors; and 4) examination of biologic and
contextual mediators and moderators of observed adolescent-midlife linkages.
The proposed study addresses each of these Aims with a uniquely intense combination of repeated interviews,
sociometric assessments, and direct observations of interactions with parents, peers, and romantic partners,
with the new addition in midlife of an array of highly valid physiological indicators of health and aging—all
obtained from a socio-demographically diverse final sample of 172 individuals (with 97% sample retention to
date), followed across a 25-year span, from age 13 into midlife (ages 33 – 37). The proposed study has
significance in allowing: a. identification of several entirely new arenas within adolescence for potential
interventions to promote lifelong health and healthy aging; b. suggest specific relational characteristics to target
across this period in screening and preventive interventions; c. distinguish social processes in adolescence
that directly predict accelerated aging (and are thus critical to address within adolescence) from those that lead
to mediated chains of risk (which would suggest multiple promising points of intervention); and d. dramatically
advance overall theoretical understanding of the ways in which early relationship difficulties are linked to and
potentially affect physical health and aging outcomes well into midlife."

Obesity now affects over 40% of the US population and is considered the most common chronic inflammatory
condition. This increase in prevalence can be attributed to more sedentary lifestyles in combination with easy
access to highly palatable, calorically dense foods. Health care providers often prescribe lifestyle modifications
to combat obesity and the negative metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes associated with this disease;
however, keeping adiposity at bay is often the greatest challenge faced by individuals. Many individuals find
themselves weight cycling — periods of repeated weight loss and weight regain for a significant portion of their
life, which leads to worsened glucose tolerance and cardiometabolic outcomes. The increase in adiposity that
accompanies obesity is characterized by recruitment of proinflammatory immune cells into the adipose tissue
that is not resolved with weight loss, suggesting that immune memory in adipose tissue contributes to diseases
associated with obesity. We have developed and characterized a robust model of weight cycling in mice and
observed that animals that weight cycle have worsened glucose tolerance compared to their non-weight cycled,
obese, weight-matched counterparts. In obesity, the adipose tissue is characterized by an increase in CD8+
effector memory T-cells that show signs of both exhaustion and memory. In Dr. Hasty’s parent funded Merit
award, the contribution of granzyme K expressing T cells to adipocyte senescence will be studied. In other work,
we have shown that this memory T cell population is clonally expanded suggesting that adipose tissue
“remembers” previous cycles of obesity, which may contribute to the worsened glucose tolerance seen in our
weight cycled animals. To test the hypothesis that T cell memory plays a role in the metabolic outcomes we
observe in weight cycling mice, Dr. Garcia has focused on the surface protein CD70, a ligand specific to antigen
presenting cells that binds to the CD27 receptor on T cells promoting T cell memory formation. Her preliminary
findings indicate that CD70-/- weight-cycled animals are protected from worsened glucose tolerance seen in the
wild-type littermates. Therefore, this application aims to identify whether inhibiting T cell memory formation during
the weight loss phase functions to prevent clonal expansion within the adipose tissue environment leading to
overall reduced inflammatory potential and prevention of the impaired metabolic phenotypes seen in wild-type
weight cycled mice. To determine the critical timing for memory formation, we will use a CD70 depletion antibody
during the weight gain or weight loss phases and observe whether mice treated with this antibody are protected
from worsened glucose tolerance. We will also use single cell RNA sequencing via the 10X Genomics Platform
on adipose tissue from CD70-/- and wild-type mice to determine how loss of CD70 impacts the immune cell milieu.
Ultimately, this work serves to uncover the interplay between immunological memory and metabolic outcomes
in obesity potentially offering a candidate for immunological therapeutics that attenuate metabolic disease.
Because our Veterans have even higher rates of obesity than our non-Veteran population, discovery of immune-
mediated mechanisms for diseases associated with obesity is a critical area of research. Furthermore, funding
of this supplement will allow Dr. Garcia additional training in my group as she progresses toward an independent
career."

The collision of the COVID-19 pandemic with the existing HIV epidemic in the U.S. has exacerbated the decades
old racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. For example, Blacks account for 42-44% of HIV diagnoses and deaths among
people living with HIV (PLWH) while accounting for only 12% of the population. These racialized disparities in
the U.S. HIV epidemic are further compounded by the same disparities emerging in COVID-19. We have shown
that PLWH appear to be at higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes than persons not living with HIV (PNLWH),
and that the odds of incident COVID-19 infection among PLWH are 60% and 118% higher among Black and
Latinx persons, respectively, than whites. These racialized disparities are likely largely driven by social
determinants of health (SDoH) underlying our health systems—an understanding of the SDoH pathways that
elucidate these disparities is urgently needed to develop the next generation of HIV interventions operating at
the structural and social levels, and ever more now in the context of COVID-19.
 The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) leverages real-world, national data and presents an
unprecedented opportunity to inform the NIH priority aims to understand the social and biologic factors that may
affect both HIV and COVID-19 outcomes. N3C is the largest electronic health record (EHR) repository in U.S.
history (>10M patients), contains both unparalleled individual-level granular clinical and historical data, and
represents the largest U.S. cohort of PLWH with their HIV and COVID-19 outcomes data (>77K), allowing
us to evaluate the bi-directional impact of existing HIV infection and COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore,
individual-level data in the N3C are uniquely positioned to merge publicly available datasets that measure area-
level SDoH. Our central hypothesis is that the observed racial/ethnic disparities in HIV and COVID-19 occur in
a larger context of individuals embedded in social, political, and economic contexts, i.e., SDoH. Understanding
these forces, centered on SDoH, allows us to determine the next generation of HIV interventions.
 Our three aims respond to the NIH call using data science, rigorous machine and statistical learning, and
multi-level mediation and epidemic modeling. The goal of Aim 1 (HIV outcomes) is to identify multilevel, social
determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in HIV outcomes (e.g., viral suppression [VS] and hospitalization) during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of Aim 2 (COVID outcomes) is to understand the independent and
aggregated impact of SDoH and clinical characteristics on HIV immune dysfunction for COVID-19 outcomes and
vaccine effectiveness (2a) and quantify the differential impact of HIV on COVID-19 outcomes at the U.S.
population level by race/ethnicity (2b). The goal of Aim 3 (HIV epidemic modeling) is to quantify the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV treatment (VS and hospitalization) and prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis
[PrEP] use and HIV/sexually transmitted infections [STI] testing frequency) outcomes by race/ethnicity at the
population-level for the national Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative’s priority jurisdictions."

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are four times more likely to acquire Clostridioides difficile
infection (CDI), and experience higher mortality and excessive complications compared to the general
population. The mechanism by which IBD confers susceptibility to CDI is unknown, making it impossible to
implement preventative measures for IBD patients. The long-term goal is to investigate how interactions between
the gut microbiota and host contribute to colonization resistance against enteric pathogens in complex diseases
such as IBD. The overall objective of this application is to define the role of the gut microbiota and the microbially
derived secondary bile acids (SBAs) in conferring susceptibility and contributing to the severity of CDI during
intestinal inflammation caused by IBD. The central hypothesis is that inflammation-induced alterations in the gut
microbiota lead to a decrease in SBAs resulting in loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile thus
exacerbating this infection in IBD patients. Guided by preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursing
two specific aims: 1. Determine if supplementation with the exogenous secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) alters susceptibility and disease severity during CDI in IBD; and 2. Determine if modulation of intestinal
microbiota derived bile acid composition alters susceptibility and disease severity during CDI in IBD. For Aim 1,
IL10-/- colitis mice administered daily UDCA will be challenged with C. difficile. Inflammation-induced alterations
in the gut microbiome, bile acid metagenome and metabolome, and host response during CDI will be defined.
For Aim 2, precision gut microbiota modulation will be used to compare inflammation-induced (IL10-/- colitis) CDI
susceptibility and severity in microbial ecosystems capable of synthesizing SBAs to ones that cannot. This
approach is innovative because it utilizes intestinal inflammation as the sole initiator of gut microbiota and bile
acid alterations to confer susceptibility to CDI. This contribution is significant because it will lead to novel non-
antibiotic therapeutic and preventative interventions for IBD patients with CDI aimed at reducing morbidity,
mortality, and health care costs for this patient demographic. Deciphering interactions between the gut
microbiota, microbially derived SBAs, and the host may elucidate how intestinal inflammation confers
susceptibility to CDI. Finally, this proposal will advance my training in shotgun metagenomics, integration of
bioinformatics, murine IBD models, and rational manipulation of the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolome
into hypothesis driven research. This will support my transition into an independent clinician scientist in
translational and interdisciplinary infectious disease research. This work will be completed at the Ohio State
University College of Veterinary Medicine under the guidance of my mentoring team with globally recognized
expertise in the fields of metagenomics, bioinformatics, rational gut microbiota manipulation, host-microbe
interactions, and IBD pathogenesis."
10873855,"Abstract:
Self-renewal is an indispensable property that allows stem cells to regenerate and maintain the homeostasis of
functionally diverse cell populations. Dergulation of self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) directly links
to a number of hematopoietic degenerative disorders including bone marrow failure and various blood diseases,
whereas its aberrant activation is a defining and indispensable feature of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that sustain
the malignant phenotypes. We and others have shown that self-renewal of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem
cells heavily rely on the key component of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin and the homeobox protein,
HOXA9 that are largely dispensable for adult HSCs. Although these findings reveal a contrasting functional
requirement and a potential therapeutic opportunity for AML, development of small molecule inhibitors against
oncogenic transcription factors has so far met with very little success largely due to our lack of understanding
about the molecular regulations of these proteins in mediating hematopoietic self-renewal, which has significantly
hindered progress in developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat the resultant diseases. Intriguingly, we
have recently revealed coregulation of both canonical Wnt pathway and posterior HOXA loci including HOXA9
by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), HOTTIP. Strikingly, we also report a novel crosstalk between β-catenin
and HOXA9 that can override their individual requirement in both mouse and human AML of HSC origins. In
search for crucial mediators for β-catenin and Hoxa9 functions, we further identified that protein arginine
methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which also implicates in DNA damage and repair (DDR), can functionally replace
HOXA9 or β-catenin in AML stem cell originated from HSCs. PRMT1 together with DDR complex are unbiasedly
isolated along with CTCF/cohesin complex, hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) and nucleosome
remodeling factors as HOTTIP interacting partners by ChIRP-MS in AML cells. These findings not only discover
a novel HOTTIP/β-catenin-HOXA9/PRMT1 axis critical for mediating hematopoietic self-renewal, but also lead
to central hypothesis that HOTTIP/β-catenin-HOXA9/PRMT1 axis coordinates hematopoietic self-renewal and
characterization of the functions of individual components and their crosstalk along the axis regulates
hematopoietic specific transcription networks and DDR pathways to modulate hematopoietic self-renewal in the
disease setting. In this proposal, we will 1 decipher cooperative action of HOTTIP and hematopoietic TFs in
regulating HOXA9 and β-catenin axis; 2) dissect the molecular functions and regulation of β-catenin-
HOXA9/Prmt1 axis during normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Success completion of proposed studies not
only will establish the molecular principles, but also facilitate the design of specific therapeutics in modulating
self-renewal activities in normal and malignant stem cells, which can be potentially translated into patient
benefits."

Molecular imaging plays a pivotal role in biomedical research. By enabling the visualization of biological
processes directly in tissue, in situ assessments of cellular function can be recorded with spatial context. The
use of mass spectrometry as a molecular imaging modality combines the high level of molecular specificity
provided by the mass spectrometer with the spatial fidelity of a microscopic imaging approach. By this, imaging
mass spectrometry (IMS) provides for the label-free mapping of a wide array of biomolecules in tissue
specimens. Accurate identification of the biochemical pathways altered during development and dysfunction is
a key step in designing novel treatment strategies for a variety of applications, such as in studies of diabetes,
infectious disease, drug pharmacology, and cancer. However, severe deficiencies remain in the differentiation
and structural identification of molecules detected during imaging mass spectrometry experiments due to the
enormous chemical complexity of tissue samples. The failure to adequately separate and identify these
compounds results in ion images consisting of multiple different compounds with overlapping masses. This
distorted picture of molecular distributions clouds the interpretation of the biochemical maps produced by imaging
mass spectrometry and prevents a complete and accurate understanding of cellular compositions and functions.
This proposal aims to develop methods and instrumentation that will enable tissue imaging at unparalleled levels
of sensitivity, separation, and identification. This will be achieved through the discovery and development of
novel gas-phase ion/ion reactions that target specific chemical functional groups in lipids and metabolites
(Specific Aim 1). These reactions offer rapid and flexible means for molecular transformations without
manipulating the tissue sample and can result in improved detection limits and more extensive chemical
structural information. Developing reproducible and quantitative ion/ion reaction methodologies will enable
reliable measurements to be made from tissue (Specific Aim 2). The development of instrumentation that can
perform gas-phase ion/ion reactions with high throughput will enable these transformations to be performed
directly during imaging mass spectrometry experiments (Specific Aim 3). These ‘reactive’ images are anticipated
to reveal spatial biochemical detail unobtainable by conventional imaging modalities. The continual development
of new analytical technologies such as those proposed herein is crucial in order to address increasingly
complicated biological and clinical questions."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly, and patients with
the most common dry form suffer from limited treatment options. In dry AMD, some retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to survive microenvironmental stress, and can
reside alongside both normal and dying RPE, contributing to the functional and morphological RPE heterogeneity
that defines AMD. In humans and mice, mitochondrial and stress response defects have emerged as
independent mechanisms to explain RPE abnormalities. In pilot experiments, knockdown of Pink1, the driver of
mitophagy, causes death resistant EMT in human RPE cell lines in an Nrf2 dependent manner. Four cell types
generated by knockdown of Pink1 and/or Nrf2 (normal, single knockdowns, and the double knockdown) show
differences in morphology and viability, which simulates RPE heterogeneity. The central hypothesis to be tested
in this proposal is that impaired mitophagy induces EMT in RPE cells through Nrf2 dependent retrograde
signaling, from the mitochondria to the nucleus, and that failure of Pink1 mediated mitophagy and/or Nrf2
signaling contributes to RPE heterogeneity in dry AMD. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the extent that
impaired mitophagy induces EMT in RPE cells. 2) Determine how Nrf2 dependent mitochondrial retrograde
signaling induces a pro-survival EMT transcriptome in the RPE. 3) Determine the degree that mitophagy and
mitochondrial retrograde signaling contribute to RPE heterogeneity with an AMD phenotype. The significance of
this project is that successful completion will identify novel drug target pathways and that death resistant EMT
cells can be targeted for therapeutic rejuvenation rather than cells committed to death. This study is innovative
because it proposes i) that impaired mitophagy in conjunction with Nrf2 signalling is a trigger for EMT, ii) that the
interplay of mitophagy and Nrf2 signalling can explain RPE heterogeneity, and iii) to use state-of-the art
genetically modified human iPS cells generated by Crispr/Cas9 editing and unique mouse models. This project
will take advantage of the PI's background in mitochondrial biology and molecular genetics and the PI will be
further trained in retinal biology and animal models of AMD in Dr. Handa's lab (mentor), in stem cell editing by
Dr. Zack (co-mentor) and in advanced cell biology by Dr. Sesaki (co-mentor), who are all leaders in their fields.
The project is on track because of successfully established stem cell biology and animal facilities in the mentor's
and co-mentors' labs, and the mouse strains for this study have already been generated. We have obtained
Pink1 knockout stem cell line from our collaborator Dr. Dawson for Aim 1, and a CRISPR edited Nrf2 mutant is
underway for aims 2 and 3. The PI is in the ideal environment for the proposed research as Wilmer has world-
class facilities to complement the renowned scientists available within the entire Hopkins community will help
the PI to set-up collaboration and learn new techniques to build an independent research career."
10873954,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Due partly to socio-economic reasons, there is a general trend of increased parental age in the industrialized
countries. Advanced parental age is known to be associated with several risk factors including decreased
genome integrity, impaired organ maintenance, increased mutations (which may cause testicular cancer), altered
epigenome in the germline, and reduction in fertility. Importantly, these germline alterations can be transmitted
to the offspring, resulting in higher risks for several diseases/syndromes (e.g. Achondroplasia, Apert, Noonan
and Costello) in their children. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying human testis aging is
highly understudied. Prior work on human germline and niche has involved physiological approaches, but has
not revealed the detailed molecular and genomic drivers of germline development, or which aspects deteriorate
during aging. The recent advent of powerful single-cell genomics approaches allows us to examine gene
expression, chromatin and DNA methylation (DNAme) genome-wide, and offer major new opportunities for a
molecular and mechanistic understanding of the impact of aging on both germline and somatic niche cells. In
this proposal, by utilizing a combination of single cell genomics, molecular and cell biology approaches, we aim
to gain a mechanistic understanding of how human germline ages in respond to the aging niche, and how this is
related to individuals’ health and that of their offspring. Our prior studies established many principles of germline
transcription-epigenetic relationships and inheritance, provided the first single-cell analyses of pubertal and adult
testes, and described the first age-dependent changes in sperm DNAme. This project aims to greatly extend our
prior work, by utilizing our robust testis acquisition pipeline (66 pairs of whole testes preserved with ongoing
acquisition) to examine thousands of germline and niche cells from young adults through men of advanced age,
to test the following Hypothesis: The transcription, open chromatin and DNAme status of human male
germline (spermatogonia and developing gametes) changes during aging, and responds to changes in
the aging niche. Specifically, we will utilize single cell genomics techniques to examine the transcription, open
chromatin and DNAme profiles of testicular cells from age stratified males (20-29, 30-39 etc). We aim to
understand the impact of aging on the germline (AIM 1) and somatic niche cells (AIM 2). Importantly, we will
also apply functional experiments including spermatogonia xenotransplantation and in vitro organoid culturing,
aiming to test the developmental potential of germline or testicular niche cells. Furthermore, as BMI (body mass
index) often increases with age, we will also assess the correlations of observed changes with BMI, as we have
sufficient samples to stratify each age range by high and low BMI. Taken together, by identifying potential drivers
for human testis aging, we aim to transform the management of age-associated pathology (e.g. infertility and
cancer) and gain a deep molecular understanding of the diseases/disorders caused by advanced paternal age."
10881842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Racial disparities in health arise in complex ways. Multicomponent interventions to address them (often
implemented by healthcare systems, employers, and community organizations) are often designed to address
multiple mechanisms (e.g., medication adherence, lifestyle behaviors). However, not all such interventions are
effective in reducing disparities in health. Designing effective interventions requires knowing which barriers to
health, when acted upon, may greatly reduce disparity. Standard approaches (e.g., mediation analysis, Oaxaca-
Blinder decomposition) are often used to generate this evidence base but do so under severe limitations,
including their inattention to concepts of equity (e.g., they often over-adjust measures of racial disparity for factors
implicated in disparity such as socioeconomic status), and their inattention to matters of causal inference (e.g.,
confounding). Causal decomposition methods, in contrast, answer the question: how much disparity in an
outcome (e.g., hypertension control) would change if we could equitably remove racial disparity in a barrier to
health (e.g., clinical inertia in treatment decision-making). They consider what variables should separately be
accounted for when measuring disparity in an outcome, when removing disparity in a barrier, and while
addressing confounding. This new approach is being taken up by applied researchers, but often they are
interested in more general settings than current methods allow. The goals of the proposed methodological project
are to extend causal decomposition methods to settings relevant for cardiovascular health equity research and
provide guidance and tools to facilitate their adoption and use. This methodological project will extend and tailor
equity-aligned causal decomposition methods to: 1) accommodate longitudinal and time-to-event data
structures; 2) accommodate aspects of patient-centeredness and intersectionality; 3) accommodate
generalization beyond the study sample to specific populations of interest. A key focus of the work will be to
disseminate existing and newly developed causal decomposition methods to applied researchers in
cardiovascular health equity through the development of tutorials, publicly available software tools, a website,
and courses and workshops at research conferences. The methods development and dissemination will be
informed by three illustrative data sets, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study,
the Reducing Inequities in Care of Hypertension: Lifestyle Improvement for Everyone (RICH LIFE) Project, and
the All of Us Research Program (AURP). If this proposal is successful, the methods developed herein could
support the design of effective, targeted, and multicomponent interventions that reduce disparity, e.g., those of
the Health Equity Action Network and the RESTORE Health Equity Network."
10882447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diabetes is a major co-morbidity of cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting 20% of adolescents and 40-50% of adults
with CF. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with worse disease outcomes and a 4-fold increase in
mortality relative to CF patients without diabetes. Impaired insulin release is the key defect underlying CFRD,
but its etiology is poorly understood.
 Pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) are the major source of pancreatic CFTR and are the initiating
site of CF pancreas pathology, which leads to destruction of pancreatic acini (in 85% of CF cases). Islets are
relatively preserved in the CF pancreas. However, islet morphology is profoundly altered, including increased α
cells (although glucagon release is impaired in CF), and loss of islet capillaries and macrophages. These cell
types support normal β cell function and so their disruption in CF likely contributes to insulin deficiency.
 Recent studies, including our preliminary data, show that knockdown/inhibition of CFTR in PDECs can
induce islet dysfunction (impaired insulin release). However, the relative contribution of direct PDEC-islet
effects vs. those occurring indirectly via pancreatic acinar cells or other islet cells are unknown. Moreover, the
underlying mechanisms are entirely unexplored. We hypothesize that CFTR-defective human PDECs exert
detrimental effects on β cells, both directly and indirectly, to impair insulin release and β cell health.
 We will perform studies in primary human cells (PDECs, islet β-cells, α- cells, acinar cells, islet endothelial
cells and macrophages). We will also use CF donor pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived PDECs.
Specific Aim 1: To determine whether CFTR-defective PDECs impair insulin release via direct effects on islet
β-cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis will be done on PDECs and PDEC-derived extracellular
vesicles using primary or hPSC-derived PDECs ± CFTR mutations. From these data, we will identify key
pathways that mediate cross talk between PDECs and β cells. The impact of those pathways will then be
tested in intervention studies using islets and primary human β cells.
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether CFTR-defective PDECs impair insulin release indirectly. We will
recapitulate the known toxic effects of CFTR-defective PDECs on acinar cells using an in vitro system and
determine whether acinar elicited factors can themselves impair β cell function. Next, we will systematically
interrogate the effect of CFTR-defective PDECs and/or acinar cells previously exposed to those PDECS on the
function, identity and viability of islet α cells, endothelial cells and macrophages.
Specific Aim 3: Effect of PDEC-CFTR knockdown on insulin release in human pancreas slices. Pancreas
slices, which preserve the 3D arrangement of pancreatic cell types, will be used to determine the effect of
PDEC-CFTR loss on insulin release over time, along with concurrent measurement of the viability/function of
acinar cells and α-cells along with morphological changes in islet endothelial cells and macrophages."
10881240,"Project summary: Today, assisted living communities (ALs) are a popular choice for older adults who can no
longer maintain an independent lifestyle at home. However, ALs generally do not offer medical services on-
site. This may be challenging, especially for the more than 40% of AL residents with ADRD, who often have
complex health conditions and require regular outpatient primary and specialty services (e.g., mental health) to
manage their health needs. Accessing and arranging transportation for these necessary services may be
difficult and burdensome for these residents due to their physical and cognitive impairments, and due to the
limited availability of some services. Telemedicine, which has expanded greatly since the pandemic, may
provide an opportunity to improve access to care for AL residents with ADRD. However, the impact of the
telemedicine policy may vary across ALs and be influenced by market- and state-level factors. Effective
telemedicine utilization may require resources, such as infrastructure (e.g., high-speed internet) and a
sufficient and well-trained workforce. Direct care workers (DCWs) are the main care providers in ALs and play
a crucial role in supporting residents with ADRD. Several factors, including AL-level resources, market-level
direct care workforce, and state AL regulations, may affect AL infrastructure, staffing and training, and,
consequently, effective telemedicine use in ALs. To date, there is very limited empirical evidence on the
potential impact of the CMS’ telemedicine policy on AL residents. Thus, the objective of this study is to use a
mixed-method approach to understand multi-level factors at AL- (SA1), market- (SA2), and state-level (SA3)
that may influence the impact of telemedicine policy on AL residents with ADRD. By using 2018-2024 data, we
will examine telemedicine and all visits (including in-person) for different types of outpatient services (e.g.,
mental health, primary care), as well as the use of other health services (e.g., hospitalizations and long-term
nursing home [NH] placement) that may be affected by regular outpatient services. We hypothesize that
residents with ADRD in ALs with fewer resources, in markets with lower wages of DCWs, or in states with less
specific regulations are less likely to “benefit” from the policy - that is, they are less likely to use telemedicine
outpatient services and more likely to have hospitalization, emergency room visits, and NH placement,
accounting for the differences in these events before the pandemic. We will also collect primary data (through
interviews) to explore how key AL, staff, and resident/family characteristics vary in ALs and their potential
associations with telemedicine use (SA4). The study is innovative because it will be the first to address the
proposed research objectives. This study is significant because it will provide important findings on potential
benefits/challenges to telemedicine use in ALs for residents with ADRD. Findings will also shed light on
regulatory policies that may create barriers to and exacerbate disparities in receiving appropriate care in this
population. This study will provide important and timely insights into the CMS’ telemedicine policy decisions."
10886063,"NIA issued RFA-AG-22-011 to test compounds to “prevent, delay, or treat aging-related conditions by modulating fundamental aging-related mechanisms” in humans. RFA-AG-22-011 specified the need for clinical trials to determine the effects on 1) predictors of clinical outcomes, 2) the specificity of molecular target versus off-target effects, and 3) safety. Pharmacological inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been repeatedly demonstrated to extend lifespan and prevent or delay several age-related diseases in diverse model systems. However, the risk of potentially serious side effects in humans have thus far prevented the long-term use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a therapy for aging and age-related diseases. Therefore, a critical gap in knowledge is whether rapamycin or rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) can safely improve healthy aging in humans. Our team has demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is beneficial and extends healthy aging in mice; however, many of the negative side effects of rapamycin result from “off-target” inhibition of a second mTOR complex (mTORC2) in multiple tissues. We and others have systematically identified intermittent dosing schedules and alternative rapalogs that enable more selective mTORC1 inhibition. The objective of this project is to determine if 24 weeks of daily low dose (0.5 mg/day) or weekly intermittent (5 mg/week) treatment with the rapalog everolimus can safely improve physiological and molecular hallmarks of aging in middle-aged to older insulin resistant adults who are at high risk for nearly every age-related condition. Using a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we will perform a battery of gold standard and innovative techniques to test the hypothesis that daily low dose or weekly everolimus treatment will improve five interrelated domains of physiological aging: metabolic, cardiac, cognitive, physical, and immune function. We will also assess the incidence of adverse events and changes from baseline blood chemistry, hematology, lipids, glucose, insulin, and c-peptide. To comprehensively examine the molecular target specificity and the impact on mechanisms of aging by everolimus, we will evaluate mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, assess mitochondrial bioenergetics, and perform a multi-omics approach (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) in blood and muscle biopsy samples. We will also explore the role of everolimus on the senescence-associated secretary phenotype, the DNA methylation clock, and proposed biomarkers of aging. To complete this holistic approach, the assembled team of scientists and clinicians are all located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and will leverage multiple NIH-funded resources to ensure safe, rigorous, and efficient study execution. By completion of this study, we expect to understand if everolimus can safely exploit the potent gero-protective effects of mTORC1 inhibition for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases in humans."
10886097,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescents with congenital heart disease [CHD], including repair of tetralogy of Fallot [TOF], dextro-transposi-
tion of the great vessels [d-TGA], or functionally univentricular heart physiology [Fontan], have lower cardiorespir-
atory fitness [FIT] compared with healthy peers. FIT is a well-established predictor of morbidity, quality of life
[QOL], and heart transplantation and is among the strongest predictors of mortality in this population. However,
adolescents with CHD have significantly lower FIT when compared to cardio-typical peers, due to abnormal
hemodynamics as well as low durations and intensities of physical activity [PA] and exercise. Pediatric cardiac
rehabilitation [CR] programs which prescribe aerobic and resistance exercise over 12-wks. have demonstrated
improvements in FIT for patients with CHD which persist months after completion of the program. Unfortunately,
few hospitals/clinics offer CR programming for children and adolescents due to the financial costs of building
and maintaining a CR facility, as well as the travel cost, time requirement, and burden for parents/caregivers
to transport their child to/from a hospital for CR exercise sessions multiple times per week. In-home CR reduces
barriers related to patient access and the financial burden for hospitals, though data supporting the effectiveness
of in-home CR for youth is limited. The use of group video conferencing technology via tablet computer repre-
sents a novel and potentially transformational strategy for delivering real-time, live, supervised CR to groups of
adolescents with CHD in their homes. The goal of this K23 research plan is to evaluate the effectiveness of video
conferencing for the delivery of real-time CR to groups of adolescents with CHD in their homes. We propose a
12-wk. randomized-controlled clinical trial assigning 74 adolescents [12-19 years old] with 1 of 3 CHD diagnoses
[Fontan, TOF, or d-TGA] to Remote CR [RCR] [in-home, live, remote group exercise, 3-45-min sessions/week.]
or Active control [in-home, self-directed exercise]. Our aims will assess the effectiveness of the RCR approach
by comparing between-group changes [0-12 weeks] in: FIT, cardiac function, lean body mass, and frailty. Ex-
ploratory aims will assess between group differences [0-12 weeks] in physical function, QOL, PA self-efficacy,
and will evaluate the impact of demographic characteristics on program participation and satisfaction, and daily
PA. We hypothesize the RCR intervention will elicit greater improvements in each outcome compared to the
control group. The PI’s short term career development goal of enhancing knowledge, skills, and experiences in
clinical trials research, CHD physiology, and implementation and dissemination [I&D] outcomes research in youth
with CHD will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary team of mentors, formal programming/coursework,
independent study, and scientific meetings. Career development training and experiences and data from the
research plan will prepare the PI to accomplish his long-term career goals to 1] establish an independently
funded research program conducting clinical trials to evaluate the impact of exercise, FIT on physical and psy-
chosocial function in youth with CHD; and 2] I&D of CR programs across multiple sites."

This is a revision of a 4th competitive renewal of a T32 training grant to support research on infectious disease
(ID), inflammation, and immunology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM HSC). The
long-term goal remains: to provide state-of-the-art instructional and experiential training in infectious diseases,
immunology and inflammation, scientific ethics, teaching, and a perspective of careers in science provided by
outstanding investigators who sustain high impact research programs. In the 19 years since inception, the
Infectious Disease and Inflammation Program (IDIP) training has positively impacted graduate education
across UNM campuses and has increased visibility of ID and immunology research in the community in the
greater Albuquerque, NM area. Since 1998 the UNM IDIP has provided 29 pre- and 18 post-doctoral trainees
opportunities to engage in cutting edge, interdisciplinary and technology-centered research and learn from
scientists with diverse and complementary areas of expertise. We have enjoyed substantial success recruiting
under-represented minorities (URM; 26%) and women (50%) to the program. In the past 10 years, 14/15 pre-
doc trainees (93.3%) have completed their PhD degrees, and most remain in scientific research. Of 18 prior
postdoc trainees 14 (78%) have successfully transitioned to academic appointments or are continuing in
research science; 56% are in faculty positions. Our graduates hold faculty appointments at institutions such as
the University of Arizona, the University of Texas-El Paso, Yale School of Public Health, the University of
Vermont, and the University of New Mexico. Crossing departmental and institutional lines, the IDIP draws upon
the expertise of 24 nationally funded primary mentors, investigators with extensive collaborative interactions in
terms of research grants, publications, and trainee mentoring. Mentors-in-training (8) and other experts (4) are
included in the training faculty. IDIP training faculty reside in the UNM Health Sciences Center, UNM School of
Engineering and the College of Arts & Sciences, the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, and at Sandia
and Los Alamos National Laboratories. Faculty trainers fall into four research themes: Translational Studies in
Infection & Immunity; Mechanisms of Infection & Immunity; Pathogenesis of Infections & Inflammation;
Bridging Technologies – use of cutting-edge and emergent technologies to study ID. The IDIP will continue to
support 4 pre- and 2 post-doctoral fellows per year and will be overseen by committed mentors and productive
scientists, Drs. Ozbun (Director) and Chackerian (Assoc. Director), a training faculty steering committee,
faculty with transdisciplinary expertise and an External Advisory Committee. All trainees complete IDIP-specific
courses in addition to their required course work including RCR, specific journal clubs, and works in progress
sessions. The momentum of IDIP is poised to realize even greater impact with its far larger cadre of trainers
and greater access to high-quality minority and non-minority students. Support for our program will yield
substantial rewards, expanding the ranks of highly interdisciplinary young investigators."
10885944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Periodontitis is a highly prevalent disease associated with several debilitating systemic conditions,
including vascular and lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, and pre-term birth. The most recent epidemiological
evidence suggests that tobacco smoking accounts for the majority of destructive periodontal disease cases in
developed nations. Smoking enhances infection rates and enriches numbers of a key periodontal pathogen,
Porphyromonas gingivalis. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are in need of elucidation. In
the first iteration of award, facilitated by a two year NIGMS-funding mechanism, we generated an 80,000 colony
transposon sequencing library for P. gingivalis strains ATCC 33277 and exploited this resource to:
 (i) Successfully identify 256 genes that are putatively essential for surviving tobacco-induced stress;
 (ii) Delineate a “core stress genome” commonly required for tobacco-survival, epithelial colonization
 and subcutaneous abscess formation; and
 (iii) Validated several genes as conditionally essential for P. gingivalis to survival of cigarette smoke-
 induced stress in vitro by generating single gene deletion mutants that exhibit either reduced
 absolute fitness in competition assays with the parental P. gingivalis strain in smoked medium;
 (iv) We have also generated a novel murine model of tobacco-exacerbated periodontitis.
 We now plan to build on these successes via three specific aims, as follow:
Aim 1: Further elucidate P. gingival CSE-related survival strategies by generating mutants in single genes
that are both CSE-essential (TnSeq data) ;and tobacco-regulated (RNAseq and qPCR); yet not compromised in
their ability to colonize oral epithelial cells (TIGK model) or immune resistance (murine abscess model).
Aim 2: Determine in vivo relevance of putatively CSE-essential genes using a murine smoke-exposure
chamber model in a chronic Baker model of P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.
Aim 3: Establish the broad applicability of data gathered in Aims 1 and 2 by confirming biological function
and distribution of CSE essential genes in multiple P. gingivalis strains.
 Long term advances are likely to include (a) A better understanding of how P. gingivalis thrives in a
tobacco-toxin rich environment; (b) Future therapeutic targeting of essential genes to control P. gingivalis
infection in smokers (CSE-essentiality data) and in general (multiple disease-relevant conditions, core stress
genome data); (c) Alternate treatment regimens for smokers based on mechanistic insight into smoke-induced
and/or exacerbated periodontal diseases;and (d) The establishment of an essential gene database for tobacco-
enhanced pathogens that will facilitate the identification of common bacterial strategies for surviving tobacco
smoke exposure, thus, broadening the significance of the research beyond the oral cavity."
10886119,"ABSTRACT
 For older adults, poor communication about serious injury and life-limiting illness has consequences for
patients and families, clinicians, and healthcare systems. Afflicting 500,000 older adults annually, treatment for
traumatic injury frequently involves burdensome interventions (like prolonged life support), major changes in
functional or cognitive status, and high mortality. Surgeons use mortality statistics to communicate about the
gravity of illness, but current communication standards often lead to goal discordant care, moral distress for
clinicians, and prolongation of the dying process. Given high treatment burdens and frequency of poor
prognosis, seriously injured older adults would benefit from communication interventions that clarify patients'
goals, alleviate conflict in the ICU, and reduce unwanted invasive procedures for dying patients.
 A Randomized Clinical Trial of Scenario Planning for Older Adults with Serious Injury is a 5-year
R01 Clinical Trial that responds specifically to NOSI-AG-20-041 for evaluation of decision support tools and
communication aids for seriously ill older patients and their surrogate decision-makers to achieve goal-
concordant care. We have developed a novel communication tool called Best Case/Worst Case-ICU that uses
scenario planning—narrative description of plausible futures—and a graphic aid to illustrate information about
the patient's care trajectory and overall prognosis for daily use in the trauma ICU. We pilot tested this
intervention and found that surgeons can use this tool to support families and it may improve quality of
communication and reduce clinician moral distress. We are now ready to test the intervention in a large-scale
effectiveness study. We propose a pragmatic multisite randomized clinical trial following 4,500 older adults with
traumatic injury. We aim to test the effectiveness of the Best Case/Worst Case-ICU intervention on quality of
communication (Aim 1), clinician moral distress (Aim 2), and length of stay in the ICU (Aim 3).
 This award will allow us to test an intervention that is easily scalable and can be disseminated rapidly
for use with older adults with serious illness. The research is innovative because it tests scenario planning —a
decision-making strategy that has been successfully applied in business and government—but is not widely
used in healthcare. The research is significant because, if we demonstrate effectiveness, it has the potential to
transform how surgeons and other ICU clinicians talk with patients and families about treatment and prognosis
and dramatically improve care older adults receive in the trauma ICU. Our multidisciplinary team has a long
history of collaboration and is well positioned to achieve our objectives. The feasibility of this study is enhanced
by support from the Coalition for National Trauma Research, which comprises the major trauma professional
organizations in the United States and uses the American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement
Program as a data collection platform."
10885945,"Functional Interrogation of T2D-associated genes in human stem cell-derived models and mice
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest-growing diseases and a leading cause of death throughout the world.
A better understanding of the disease process, including characterization of both the genetic etiology and the
contribution of different cell types to disease initiation, progression and heterogeneity promises to reveal new
therapeutic targets. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of this common complex trait have
driven the rapid identification of hundreds of T2D-associated loci. However, the mechanism(s) through which
most of these loci influence disease susceptibility remain poorly understood. Our interdisciplinary team at Penn
brings together experts in population genetics, T2D GWAS, biostatistics, metabolic tissue biology, human cellular
disease modeling and T2D pathophysiology to tackle this critical knowledge gap. In collaboration with other
Consortium groups, we aim to accomplish the following goals.
(1) Provide the diabetes research community with a robust pipeline for mapping T2D GWAS variants to
 effector genes and target tissues.
(2) Identify new genes and biological pathways that modulate susceptibility to T2D.
(3) Define gene regulatory networks relevant to T2D with the goal of uncovering therapeutic ‘entry
 points’ for developing new treatments.
For (1), we will prioritize “candidate effector transcripts” for downstream functional analyses by integrating
multiple sources of data to gain a ‘confluence of evidence’ as to their disease relevance and tissue of action.
These sources include publically available datasets, a unique collection of internal resources from the Million
Veteran Program, and our own functional genomics (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, chromatin conformation capture etc.)
data generated from stem cell-derived T2D relevant cell types. For (2), we will examine the biological function of
prioritized T2D-effector transcripts in human cell models of T2D-relevant tissue types using gain- and loss-of-
function methods combined with a battery of physiological, metabolic, molecular phenotyping and genomic
approaches. These studies include the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models for pancreatic b cells,
hepatocytes, adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells, enabling precise genetic engineering and establishment of
multiple cell types in the same genetic background. Through this process, we will identify 10 high priority
candidate effector genes, which we will advance for comprehensive in vivo analyses in conditional mutant mouse
models. For (3), we will perform network analyses through the integration of our multiple data sources to identify
molecular memberships in broader pathways and search for pathway components that are potentially amenable
for therapeutic targeting."
10885949,"Plantar fasciitis, a repetitive strain injury, is one of the most common causes of foot pain. Ten percent of aging
adults experience plantar fasciitis with 50% of the cases being disabling. Foot pain can lead to other problems
such as reduced mobility, depression and prescription medication use, leading to a reduced quality of life.
Relationships have been established between foot pain and weakness, reduced static and dynamic balance,
and reduced walking speed in aging adults. The standard of care for plantar fasciitis is to brace the foot with
foot orthoses and supportive shoes. However, chronic support of the arch has been shown to lead to intrinsic
foot muscle atrophy. As plantar fasciitis is associated with this atrophy, treating it with chronic arch support
only increases the risk for recurrence. In fact, there is a 50% recurrence rate and a 45.6% risk of having
plantar fasciitis 10 years after the onset of symptoms in older adults.
Minimal shoes are designed to allow the foot to function naturally, as if barefoot. They have already been
successfully implemented in older adults for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Minimal shoes are highly
flexible and lack the support of conventional footwear. This places greater demand on the foot muscles which
promotes strengthening. Stronger foot intrinsic foot muscles have been shown to reduce the strain on the
plantar fascia with each step, thereby reducing the risk of developing plantar fasciitis.
Long-term Goal: To improve treatment interventions for plantar fasciitis in aging adults.
Specific Aims: 1. Compare pain and physical function between the minimal footwear (MF) and the foot orthotic
(FO) groups at the 3 and 6 month follow-up, 2. Compare changes in intrinsic foot muscle size and strength
between MF and FO groups at the 3 and 6 month follow-up, and 3. Compare the incidence of recurrence of
plantar fascial pain between the MF and FO groups at the 12 month follow-up
Methods: 120 participants with plantar fasciitis (>6 mos.) will be recruited from 2 sites. They will be
randomized into a minimal footwear (MF) and foot orthotic (FO) group. Baseline measures of foot muscle size
and strength, static and dynamic balance, 6 min. walk test and two functional outcome questionnaires will be
obtained. The MF group will receive 2 pair of minimal shoes, and the FO group will receive 2 pair of supportive
shoes and prefabricated foot orthoses. The MF group will be given a 4-week program of foot strengthening
and flexibility exercises, while the FO group will only receive the flexibility exercises. Both groups will be given
an 8-week footwear transition program based upon their individual baseline step counts. They will return to the
laboratory to repeat the baseline measures at 3 and 6 mos. Plantar fascial pain and daily step counts will be
monitored over the course of the year. Comparisons in outcome measures as well as plantar fasciitis
recurrence will be compared between the groups."

The discovery of potent pharmaceutical agents requires expedient access to a wide range of diverse molecular
architectures, and the chemical tools available to the medicinal chemist both enable and limit this venture. Over
the past half century, transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling has grown into a powerful strategy for organic
synthesis. However, the use of the d-block elements presents specific disadvantages, including low acceptable
metal content in pharmaceutical products and susceptibility to unproductive coordination by polar medicinally-
relevant functional groups. Thus, there has been a recent surge in interest in developing cross-coupling catalysts
containing the naturally abundant main group elements of the p-block. Mechanistic understanding of the
reactivity of main group catalysts lags far behind that of transition metal catalysts, and synthetic applications
remain limited. One particularly promising approach for main group catalysis is to utilize the P(III)⇌P(V) redox
couple as one would employ the analogous redox couples of transition metal catalysts. To develop improved
biphilic catalysts for phosphorus redox cycling chemistry, a more complete mechanistic understanding of the
factors affecting catalyst performance is necessary. Towards this end, the proposed research will employ two
distinct approaches to catalyst development: multivariate regression analysis to correlate phosphetane structure
with desired redox properties, and computational modeling to guide the rational design of a novel class of boron-
and silicon-containing phosphetanes with reduced frontier orbital energy gaps. The detailed study of these
catalysts will provide valuable insights into the ability of phosphorus-based catalysts to facilitate carbon-
heteroatom bond formation, enabling the development of an allylic amination reaction of immediate medicinal
relevance.
This research proposal supports and aligns with the fellowship goals by requiring new skills to be learned in
inorganic synthesis, mechanistic study, and computational modeling that complement previous training in
synthetic organic methods development. The Radosevich lab provides an ideal research environment uniquely
suited to facilitate training in these areas, as evidenced by their pioneering efforts in the development of
phosphorus-catalyzed reactions. Prof. Radosevich’s personal commitment to supporting postdoctoral
researchers in their development into independent investigators ensures that the professional training goals will
be achieved. Lastly, MIT, as one of the most productive research institutions in the world, provides the resources
and equipment necessary to carry out the research proposed."

Significant spatial heterogeneity of coronary blood flow exists in the normal heart and it is exaggerated in
coronary heart disease (CHD). Despite the significant clinical relevance of ischemia in CHD, the physical and
biological determinants of spatial heterogeneity of coronary blood flow in health and disease remain uncertain.
As a result, the mechanisms of some treatments, such as coronary sinus (CS) occlusion, pulsatile intermittent
coronary sinus (CS) occlusion (PICSO) and selective auto-retroperfusion (SARP), are also not well understood.
Advances in high-performance computing now make it possible to attempt anatomically realistic distributive
mathematical models, where morphological details of the coronary vascular system are considered to truly
elucidate the spatial heterogeneity of flow. Hence, our general objective in this proposal is to develop a validated
full model of an autoregulated coronary circulation based on anatomically accurate 3D data in a dynamic model
of the beating heart; one that integrates myocardium-vessel interaction (MVI) and vasoreactivity, can explain the
spatial heterogeneity of coronary blood flow in ischemia, and elucidate the rationale for these CS interventions.
The validated model will illuminate clinically significant mechanisms underlying the redistribution of coronary flow
in ischemia and the mechanisms of CS interventions. Our central hypothesis is that regional differences in
myocardial oxygen (O2) demand produce spatial heterogeneity in coronary flow and that ischemia increases flow
heterogeneity by compromising MVI and autoregulation. Due to inherent difficulties associated with
subendocardial measurements in vivo, the absence of a validated biophysical model of the coronary circulation
has been a critical barrier to progress. Our proposal addresses this barrier and has the potential to advance
scientific knowledge in multi-scale, multi-physics modeling and, ultimately, clinical practice in diagnosis and
treatment of CHD. Accordingly, the three Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop an experimentally validated, physics-
based computational framework coupling autoregulated coronary circulation with cardiac mechanics. 2)
Elucidate the mechanical mechanisms of subendocardial vulnerability to ischemia. 3) Determine the mechanical
mechanism of action of CSO, PICSO and SARP as well as factors affecting these treatments. This proposal
takes an integrated approach (theory, computational models, and experiments) to elucidate the relationship
between spatial heterogeneity of perfusion and cardiac mechanical work, autoregulation, and O2 consumption
under pathological and treatment conditions. The proposed work will produce a novel computational framework
that will be used to elucidate the key factors controlling subendocardial vulnerability in ischemia and the
mechanism of actions of CSO, PICSO and SARP. The biophysical modeling framework will also serve as a
foundation for constructing patient-specific heart model based on standard medical imaging to assist in diagnosis
and treatment of CHD"

Nearly one out of five new HIV infections in the United States occurs among cisgender women, with 85% of
cases attributed to heterosexual contact. Black women are disproportionately affected, comprising 60% of new
HIV infections among women, although they comprise only 14% of the female population. Consistent condom
use, daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg-emtricitabine 200mg (TDF-FTC) as pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), and male partner HIV testing are evidence-based interventions for women to reduce their risk of HIV
acquisition. Yet, only 1-6% of women who could benefit from PrEP are prescribed it. Barriers to PrEP uptake are
multifactorial. Patient-level barriers to PrEP uptake include women who may not think PrEP is for them, given
that the majority of PrEP clinical trials and marketing strategies have targeted men who have sex with men. Also,
cisgender women may not perceive themselves as being at risk for HIV. Further exacerbating the discordance
between risk perception and actual risk is that women tend to be unaware of their male partners' HIV serostatus
and HIV risk factors. Provider-level barriers include difficulty identifying patients at high risk for HIV, discomfort
with sexual history taking, and lack of PrEP knowledge. Unfortunately, an accurate HIV risk assessment tool
does not exist for U.S. cisgender women and may not ever exist because the HIV incidence in U.S. women is
too low to develop it. An alternative evidence-based intervention is desperately needed. We plan to fill this gap
by identifying an effective intervention and implementation strategy to increase PrEP uptake in an ObGyn clinical
setting (where women receive prenatal care and sexual and reproductive health services). Since TDF-FTC was
approved, women have consistently expressed a preference for receiving HIV prevention services in clinics
where they receive ObGyn care. Our multi-level (patient and provider-level), multi-component intervention
includes EHR data collection and education using multi-media tools. Our central hypothesis is that
communicating tailored HIV risk messaging in real-time in a relatable and comprehensive manner to patients
and ObGyn providers can increase conversations about HIV prevention. Aim 1A: To determine the most
effective intervention and evaluate its implementation in an ObGyn clinical setting. 1B: To identify modifiable
contextual factors associated with effective implementation using the RE-AIM framework. Aim 2: To evaluate
the cost-effectiveness, return on investment, budget impact, and equity impact of the multi-level intervention
components and the implementation strategy. In collaboration with our local government- and a HRSA-funded
implementing partner sites, we hope to demonstrate a sustainable and scalable solution to increasing PrEP
counseling by ObGyn providers and PrEP uptake by patients."

People of color are underrepresented in STEAM education and careers, often due to socio-economic and
institutional factors. Success in pre-collegiate courses predicts African American student success in STEM
disciplines. A STEAM Summer Program pilot project with 6-9th grade students from Dumas, Arkansas (AR)
Public School, a predominately African American, low-income, rural town located in the AR Delta, has been
in operation at the University of Arkansas (UA) for the past 5 years. Financial support began with a two-year
grant from a local women’s group and has continued with commitments from University resources. The goals
of our proposed STEAM Summer Program are to recruit 400 rising 6th grade students from Dumas public
school and to increase engagement, outreach, and support for students and their families, STEAM teachers,
and Dumas surrounding communities through STEAM education and training. In 2018, the STEM program
expanded to include Art (now called STEAM) for broadening the knowledge of its students. Thus, we plan to:
(1) provide project-based STEAM curriculum modules and hands-on education and training to 400 rising 6th
grade students (80 per year); (2) support success by engaging 15 Dumas STEAM teachers in a project-based
STEAM Teacher Training Program; and (3) provide a pathway to college via a Child Savings Account (CSA)
program and accompanying financial education classes. The first three short-term objectives of this proposal
are to increase awareness, future orientation and efficacy in STEAM and STEAM-related fields for 400 rising
6th grade, under-represented minority (URM) students from the Dumas, AR public elementary school. The
long-term objectives are to promote excellence in STEAM teaching at Dumas schools, student efficacy and
interest in STEAM coursework, high school retention and graduation, college savings, college enrollment and
completion, and a career path in STEAM and STEAM-related fields for participants. We have partnered with
faculty experts in Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Engineering, Art, Kinesiology, Exercise Science, Education,
and Social Work to conduct the STEAM Summer Program at our campus. During the same time frame of the
STEAM Summer Program, we also plan to bring Dumas STEAM Teachers to the UA Campus in years 1-4 to
engage in 36 hours of STEAM curriculum and assessment training and to teach their new modules to their
own students; Year 5 training will be at the Dumas schools. An external evaluator will use surveys (e.g.
Measure of Problem-Solving Fitness (MPSF); Child Savings Account survey) and focus groups to (a) assess
the manner in which students and teachers solve problems, the strategies they utilize, and their use of
engineering design methodologies to efficiently solve technical and social problems that they encounter; (b)
gauge financial literacy and college savings; and (c) measure personal, social, and financial well-being. The

Social interactions with mature social partners scaffold and support far-reaching developmental outcomes
including vocabulary development, school achievement, self-control, and executive functioning. Despite being
critical to the healthy and successful development of infants, the mechanisms by which mature social partners
can influence development is not clear. An emerging literature suggests caregivers influence infant development
by directly influencing the infant’s internal state, including changes in autonomic activity. The proposed research
connects the vocalizations of mature social partners with infant autonomic activity and sustained attention, a
cognitive milestone highly predictive of individual differences in infant visual attention, self-control, language, and
later school achievement. The proposed research is focused on identifying the acoustic features of the social
partner’s voice and how those properties influence autonomic state and sustained visual attention to objects in
12- to 24-month old infants, ages when individual differences emerge with predictive consequences. The
overarching hypothesis is that the acoustic properties of caregiver voice act on the autonomic state of the infant,
supporting sustained visual attention. As such, the proposed studies measure multiple components of infant
behavior: eye gaze, body movement, and heart rate, by using methodologies such as head-mounted eye-
tracking and an in-house built wireless vest equipped with state-of-the-art sensors in addition to the voice of the
mature social partners. Specific Aim 1 (K99) uses an experimental paradigm to manipulate, identify, and link
specific acoustic features of heard vocalizations to the autonomic state of infants and to looking duration during
active visual exploration of objects in naturalistic play. Specific Aim 2 (R00) will longitudinally measure the
development of individual differences in visual attention and object name learning in relation to caregiver
vocalizations and their effect on autonomic state. Analyses will examine individual developmental trajectories
and the emergence of individual differences in sustained visual attention and name learning in relation to the
effects of caregiver vocalization on autonomic state. The proposed research will advance the field by linking the
role of in-the-moment measures of caregiver vocalization, to infant gaze and infant autonomic activity to long-
term developmental outcomes such as self-regulated attention and learning, providing a potential new path to
determining targets for intervention for at-risk infants. In pursuing these research objectives, the applicant will
complete a tailored set of scientific and professional development activities that go beyond the applicant’s current
training. This will include training in the collection and analysis of large, multimodal, longitudinal data, training in
graph theoretic network analysis, and advanced training in the measurement and analysis of sustained attention.
Coupled with the applicant’s previous training, this skillset will prepare the applicant to launch an independent
research career that is well-grounded in theory, multi-faceted in methodology, interdisciplinary, and with
translational implications."

A critically understudied part of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) pathogenesis is colonization of the mammalian
gallbladder. The gallbladder is the primary bacterial reservoir for several enteric pathogens, including Lm,
Salmonella, and Campylobacter, and serves as the source of fecally secreted bacteria that has the potential to
increase transmission of these foodborne pathogens. Here, we will dissect the nature of Lm growth in the
gallbladder and identify the bacterial metabolic and stress response pathways critical for colonization of the
murine gallbladder. To that end, we present preliminary data from our novel ex vivo model of Lm gallbladder
colonization using organs from non-human primates (NHP). These results have set the stage for investigations
into specific genes and pathways necessary for Lm replication in the gallbladder lumen. The objectives of this
proposal will be accomplished with three Specific Aims: (1) Define the gallbladder as a replicative niche for Lm.
To do this, we will determine the localization of Lm in the gallbladder and define the metabolites available in the
gallbladder lumen. (2) Identify the Lm genes required for colonization of the gallbladder. Here, fluorescent
reporter strains will be engineered to identify the Lm signaling pathways that are activated in the gallbladder
during infection. Additionally, we will evaluate specific Lm genes and pathways for their roles in pathogenesis,
with a focus on gallbladder colonization. (3) Determine the role of the immune response to Lm ∆rex infection.
Our approach is technically innovative as it takes advantage of our novel model of NHP gallbladder colonization
to globally assess bacterial genes important for replication in this unique niche. Results from these studies will
be significant as they will uncover how bacterial pathogens replicate in the gallbladder and have the potential to
uncover therapeutic targets to reduce colonization and spread of enteric pathogens."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic disease of the esophagus, partly mediated by type 2 immunity
and epithelial dysfunction. Patients with EoE suffer from dysphagia, pain, and the lowest quality of life among
children with chronic, pediatric conditions. The epithelium is the first line of defense against potential threats,
providing a physical barrier between the host and the external environment. The site where the barrier breach
occurs may be a location where normally harmless antigens encounter immune cells and potentially lead to
production of danger signals, priming a break in immune tolerance and initiation of allergic responses.
Understanding the physiologic factors that preserve/restore esophageal homeostasis will facilitate our long-term
goal of developing improved therapies with long-lasting effects and a cure for EoE.
The sharp edge between intact barrier versus barrier breach is orchestrated by proteases and protease
inhibitors. We demonstrated that losing an epithelial protease inhibitor or altering proteolytic activity provide a
paramount signal in the development of EoE. Delivery of the serine protease inhibitor A1AT reversed EoE
phenotypes (e.g., barrier function, type 2 mediator production) in vitro and in an EoE mouse model.
We have now revealed another variable in the protease-inhibitor equation; the low-density lipoprotein receptor–
related protein 1 (LRP1). LRP1 is a scavenger receptor that mediates endocytosis and elimination of ligands,
including serine protease inhibitors (serpins) in complex with proteases. Interaction of a serpin with a protease,
exposes encrypt motifs in the serpin’s sequence that interact with LRP1 and serve as LRP1 agonists. Following
the binding of a serpin-protease complex to LRP1, LRP1 initiates signaling pathways that terminate inflammatory
responses and promote epithelial homeostasis. We demonstrated that LRP1 agonists potently reverse EoE
disease in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that an intracellular truncated LRP1 fragment appears
exclusively in EoE biopsies. The function of the truncated LRP1 fragment in EoE biopsies is unknown. We
hypothesize that excessive LRP1 processing during EoE promotes transcriptional changes that propagate EoE.
In this study, we will explore the mechanism of action by which serpins and synthetic LRP1 agonists promote
inflammatory resolution in vitro and in vivo. We developed an experimental platform to investigate the function
of full-length serpins, serpin-derived peptides with LRP1 binding motifs, and small molecule inhibitors that inhibit
proteolytic activity but lack LRP1 binding motifs. Our unique experimental framework enables us to test serpin
functions that are independent of protease inhibition. We will elucidate the downstream functional consequences
of LRP1 processing in esophageal epithelial cells and investigate the enzymes responsible for LRP1 processing.
Successful completion of this study will provide fundamental insights into LRP1-serpin-protease
crosstalk and facilitate developing drugs to achieve inflammatory resolution and epithelial homeostasis
in individuals with EoE."

Hydrogels play a key role in tissue engineering, providing a supporting structure to mimic a native extracellular
matrix (ECM) micro-environment for cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. As polymer networks infiltrated
with water, hydrogels are similar with human body, constituting most of their cells, extracellular matrices,
tissues and organs due to hydrophilic polymer networks infiltrated with water so that they have been widely
applied for diabetic wound healing, bioadhesive sealant and wearable device interface in biomedical
applications. An ideal engineered biomedical hydrogel's elastic properties should match well with the native
tissue that it is being integrated. In biomedical applications, mechanical interactions with dissimilar mechanical
stiffness between target tissues/organs and hydrogels can cause impaired functional efficacy such as foreign-
body response, tissue damage or scar formation. In tissue engineering, the mechanical stiffness of hydrogels
is dynamic because numerous features can influence their elastic properties such as cell adhesion,
proliferation, migration, levels of polymer molecular weights, levels of cross-linked collagens and cell density.
Therefore, characterizing hydrogel mechanical stiffness over time is critical. Mechanical tests such as dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA) are the standard method to characterize hydrogel mechanical stiffness. However,
the major limitations of mechanical tests are that they are destructive measurements, multiple replicate
samples are required for studies with multiple time points and only global elasticity measurements are
provided. These limitations lead to difficulties for exploring the optimization of mechanical stiffness of hydrogels
to host tissues in biomedical and tissue engineering applications. In this proposal, 1) we will develop an
ultrasound-based elasticity measurement technique named two-dimensional acoustic force elastography
microscope (2D-AFEM), which can address current difficulties of mechanical tests and can repeatedly
measure 2D (x, y) Young's modulus of thin-layer cell encapsulated hydrogels. 2) To study 2D-AFEM
performance, we will test the 2D-AFEM elastography resolution, 2D Young's modulus of homogeneous and
heterogeneous hydrogel scaffolds, and validate experimental results by numerical simulation and DMA. 3) To
study how living cells affect stiffness changes of hydrogel scaffolds to obtain a desired functionality, we will use
2D-AFEM to explore elastic changes of cell encapsulated scaffolds and explore the relationship between
elastic changes and biochemical markers over time for longitudinal studies. The proposed 2D-AFEM will be a
promising modality to repeatedly and quickly evaluate 2D Young's modulus of living hydrogels over time to
explore the best match of the elasticity to host tissues for various applications in biomedical, tissue engineering
and biomaterial fields."

The biological function of skin enriched lipases (epidermal lipases) K, M and N are not defined. Some people
with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis harbor disease associated Lipase N mutations, suggesting a
clinically relevant role for this protein in skin health. In addition, our recent work indicates lipase M is critical for
skin development and function and that epidermal lipase transcripts are reduced in a chronic lesion of atopic
dermatitis. These observations suggest epidermal lipases M, N, and, potentially, K, are important for skin
development and that defects or deficiencies of one or more of these proteins may contribute to some types of
ichthyoses and atopic dermatitis. In light of these observations, the primary goal of this research is to use novel
experimental systems to understand the biological consequences of epidermal lipases K, M and N deficiency in
skin development and function. The proposed studies will use human skin equivalents lacking expression of
individual epidermal lipases (Aim 1) and an inducible lipase M conditional knock out mouse model (Aim 2) to
understand the pathologic consequences of epidermal lipase deficiencies. Understanding the consequences of
epidermal lipase deficiencies may provide insights into the molecular functions of these proteins and could lead
to novel therapies for inherited ichthyoses and atopic dermatitis."

behavior we plan to study are interventions to increase healthy behaviors, decrease unhealthy behaviors, and
improve provider decision-making. Our mission is to move promising interventions through the NIH Stage Model,
from basic science (Stage 0) and initial intervention development and testing (Stage 1), through efficacy (Stage
2-3) and effectiveness (Stage 4) testing, and eventually on to dissemination and implementation research (Stage

pain and anxiety. The NBD® requires minimal training and allow to stimulate the auricular nerves for 5 days
making NBD® a potential groundbreaking non-pharmacological approach to limit opioid use and prescription.
Rodent studies are supportive of the NBD modulating pain pathways and decreasing inflammatory abdominal
pain. Our human surgical pain pilot data is supportive that NBD® was effective in reducing postoperative opioid
requirement in adults undergoing open surgery, especially in vulnerable older patients (>65 years). Our central
hypothesis is that compared to a placebo, the NBD® will be an effective opioid-sparing tool in patients
undergoing open surgery, and that the effectiveness of the NBD would be greater in vulnerable geriatric patients
(age >65 years). Since, anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing increase post-operative pain and opioid
requirement by up to 50% and since auriculotherapy reduces psychological symptoms, we also hypothesized
that using NBD® will also reduce anxiety, depression and catastrophizing and that represents a mechanism by
which NBD® reduce perioperative opioid requirements. Our multidisciplinary team is well positioned to test the
following specific aims: 1) Quantify the opioid sparing property of NBD® following open surgery in vulnerable
geriatric patients in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2) Evaluate the efficacy of NBD® in
reducing postoperative depression, anxiety and catastrophization, and 3) Determine the effects of NBD® on the
relationship of the postoperative psychological scores and opioid consumption. This research is expected to
improve surgical pain relief, safety of postoperative opioids while minimizing opioid use, dependence, and risk
of OUD in millions of Americans who have painful surgeries each year."

 Environmental-Circadian Disruption such as shiftwork and Jetlag imposes major risk on
human health in the U.S. and abroad. It increases the risk of many metabolic and cardiovascular
disorders and cancers and effects over 16% of the U.S. workforce. Yet, the molecular
underpinnings of this process remain unclear.
 In a proteomic analysis of proteins interacting with Cry1, we identified 10 components of
COMPASS complexes. These enzymatic complexes regulate gene transcription by catalyzing
the addition of methyl groups to lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4mes) of local chromatin. Interestingly,
these chromatin marks respond to environmental circadian entrainment information such as
light, temperature or nutrients. They also happen in a circadian rhythmic manner and modulate
DNA methylation, a determinant of gene transcription and disease development. Furthermore,
functional perturbations of various COMPASS components were also implicated in pathological
conditions associated with disharmony of environmental and circadian cycles such as breast
cancer and obesity. We thus hypothesize that COMPASS complexes play a key role in
environmental-circadian alignment. Under environmental-circadian alignment condition,
COMPASS complexes are recruited by Cry1 to rhythmically methylate local H3K4s, which prevent
recruitment of DNA methyltransferases resulting in perturbations of DNA methylation and
expression of core clock gene(s). This methylation cascade modulates the circadian pattern of
gene expression, ensuring alignment of the circadian system with daily environmental cycles. The
methylation cascade fails to initiate when internal circadian system mis-aligns with external
environmental cycles, leading to perturbation of the homeostatic state of cells and development
of disorders. We will investigate this hypothesis by pursuing the following initial aims: 1: To
characterize circadian Cry1::COMPASS interaction; Aim 2: To investigate the role of COMPASS
complexes in methylation of core clock genes; Aim 3: To study the effects of environmental-
circadian disruption on COMPASS function.
 The results of this project might unveil the molecular mechanism of a fundamental biological
process: synchronization of daily internal physiological rhythms with external environmental cycles.
They might also illuminate the nuts and bolts of disorders associated with shiftwork."

The nasal cavity is a clinically accessible structure that is amenable to the topical application of nanoscale
particles to facilitate drug delivery and control local inflammation. The success of this approach requires
substrates with a high level of specificity and activity. We have designed and constructed derivatizable,
biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) nanowires that are conjugated to anti-β1 integrin antibodies. Anti-
integrin nanowires will be tested on cultured cell models, including well differentiated primary human lung and
nasal airway epithelial cells, for the ability to alter barrier function, stimulate transcytosis, and affect cell growth
and differentiation. Preliminary data supports our ability to develop anti-integrin nanowires with the capacity to
either increase or decrease tight junction permeability, depending on composition. Several complementary
approaches will be used to identify the mechanism of action for anti-integrin nanowires of different composition,
focusing primarily on their effects on cytoplasmic scaffold proteins associated with tight junctions and integrins
that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. This includes candidate and discovery based molecular methods to
identify nanowire-driven changes to the cytoplasmic scaffold proteome. Live cell and super resolution
microscopy will be used to measure the effects of anti-integrin nanowires on junctions and integrins in a native
context. One goal is to establish modes of stimulating apical integrins as a pharmacologically tractable
approach that can be preferentially switched to either improve respiratory epithelial barrier function or to
facilitate drug delivery across epithelial barriers. We also will test the effects of anti-integrin nanowires on
epithelia derived from nasal polyps, which have impaired tight junctions, are partially de-polarized, and lack
growth control. These in vitro studies will evaluate nanowires as a potential platform to treat chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, a chronic condition that significantly impairs quality of life and that is
frequently associated with lung disease."

Phase II: Functional drug fingerprinting with all-optical electrophysiology
Q-State Biosciences has developed a therapeutic discovery platform that uniquely integrates i) scalable human
cellular models of disease states, ii) diverse readouts of neuronal function using proprietary all-optical
electrophysiology called OptopatchTM, and iii) artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analytics to establish
unique, disease-relevant phenotypes for assessment of therapeutics. Optopatch simultaneously records >500
electrical activity parameters from hundreds of neurons with 1 millisecond temporal resolution, single-cell spatial
resolution, and a throughput >20,000-fold higher than manual patch clamp. Leveraging this high-throughput,
high-content data, Q-State has developed “drug fingerprinting” (DFP) algorithms to learn the archetypal patterns
of changes induced by disease states and chemical compounds, building a map of the functional
electrophysiology of human neurons. In Phase I, we populated this map with fingerprints of 400 diverse and
selective tool compounds for a wide range of hand-curated molecular targets, which serve as landmarks for
interpreting the functional effects of disease states and novel chemical compounds. We also demonstrated that
this technology could identify a disease phenotype in neurons and predict drug rescue. In Phase II, we will
advance the DFP platform in 3 ways: 1) Build tools to improve the reliability, interpretability, accessibility, and
automation of the technology. Our current platform is capable of extracting data from Optopatch assays and
fingerprinting the impacts of perturbations using representation-learning. To achieve a production-ready pipeline,
“explainable AI” techniques will be used to track how the algorithms make choices, and unit tests will affirm the
correctness of all modules. The pipeline will be automated and deployed for access by non-coders. Finally, a
new set of modules will extend DFP to high-content imaging data for mapping biological states across form and
function of neurons. 2) Expand DFP library to include clinically relevant compounds and additional neuronal
subtypes. To enable therapeutic discovery applications, we will expand our reference database to include a new
custom-assembled library of ~3,000 clinically relevant drugs, including a comprehensive set of approved
compounds, as well as unapproved bioactive molecules with acceptable safety profiles and favorable drug-like
properties. Scaling to a 384-well format assay, we will collect data for all compounds in human iPSC-derived
excitatory and inhibitory neurons, measuring pharmacological impact on both neuronal excitability and cell
morphology in a dose-dependent format to create unique multi-modal fingerprints. 3) Demonstrate
pharmacological rescue of a monogenic epilepsy in vitro and in vivo. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the
DFP platform, we will use our new database to identify compounds with potential to rescue effects of epilepsy
causing mutations. Putative in silico hits will be experimentally tested and pharmacological rescue of phenotypes
will be quantified. The best compounds will be advanced to in vivo testing in a rodent model as an initial
demonstration of the ability of the platform to rapidly identify new, clinically viable treatments for epilepsy."

Modulation of the tumor microenvironment is known to promote the growth and survival of colorectal cancer
(CRC) cells. Strong epidemiological evidence links certain types of human cancer, including CRC, with obesity,
and the obese pathophysiological state has been shown experimentally to stimulate CRC tumor growth. However,
the mechanisms involved are not fully known: in particular, the impact of the obese tumor microenvironment on
CRC tumor cellular composition, stiffness, and ECM composition is not known. Further, pathophysiologically
relevant, patient-specific models for investigating obesity-linked inflammation mediated changes in the obese,
tumor microenvironment do not exist for CRC. Thus, the objective of the proposed project is to examine modulation
of the tumor microenvironment and obesity-related CRC disease progression using tissue-engineered patient
derived xenograft (PDX) CRC models validated through comparison to patient tumors and PDX tumors. Our
collaborative team will achieve this objective by leveraging their unique combined interdisciplinary expertise
in CRC, tissue engineering, obesity and metabolic disease, transcriptomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics.
 We will use our improved models of CRC that replicate the cues found in the obese, insulin resistant/pro-
inflammatory tumor microenvironment to test the hypothesis that obesity alters stromal signaling in the
consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we have developed
a tissue-engineered platform that enables long-term in vitro culture of the patient-derived CRC cells and
recapitulation of the native tumor microenvironment, particularly the stromal component. The following
Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1. Determine the extent to which 3D in vitro engineered CMS4-derived CRC
tissues recapitulate patient and PDX tumors; Aim 2. Determine and compare the obesity mediated changes in
the stromal component and metastatic properties of CMS4-derived 3D engineered tissues and PDX tumors; and
Aim 3. Examine 3D engineered tissues, PDX tumors, and patient tumors from obese CRC patients for engineered
tissue refinement and obesity model validation.
 This investigator-initiated research effort is in response to FOA PAR-19-113, Cancer Tissue Engineering
Collaborative: Enabling Biomimetic Tissue-Engineered Technologies for Cancer Research. Overall, these efforts,
which employ state-of-the-art technologies to characterize and compare our paired models and human patient
tumors in an in-depth and rigorous manner, will develop a portable tissue-engineering platform with robust
cross-validation so that this tool can be used to uncover CRC subtype specific mechanisms of obesity-driven
tumor progression, as well as other parameters affecting CRC morbidity and mortality."
10880441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major risk factor for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a reduced level of response to alcohol. In
persons with normal alcohol metabolism, differences in level of response to an acute intoxicating dose of
alcohol result mainly from differences in acute tolerance to alcohol. Tolerance has a major influence on alcohol
consumption; tolerance to alcohol’s rewarding effects encourages more drinking to achieve a desired effect,
whereas tolerance to alcohol’s aversive properties reduces a disincentive to drink. This proposal is based on
recent findings that inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) reduce alcohol drinking in rodents. In our work
with the PDE4 inhibitor apremilast, we were struck by the relationship between its ability to reduce both alcohol
tolerance and ethanol consumption. Inhibitors of PDE4 reduce metabolism of cAMP which leads to activation
of protein kinase A (PKA). Alcohol has prominent effects on GABAA receptors, and it has been known for many
years that PKA alters the function of GABAA receptors through phosphorylation of β1 and β3 receptor subunits.
Our preliminary experiments led us to our overall hypothesis that PDE4 inhibition reduces alcohol tolerance
and alcohol consumption by increasing GABAA receptor function in the brain through PKA-mediated
phosphorylation of GABAA receptor β3 subunits, with PKA-mediated phosphorylation of β1 subunits
contributing a minor opposite effect. Studies are planned to test this hypothesis by determining whether
apremilast increases PKA-mediated phosphorylation of b3 and β1 subunits in hippocampal slices from wild
type mice. Studies will examine the role of PKA phosphorylation on alcohol-related behaviors using b3-
S408A/S409A and b1-S409A knock-in mice, which lack the PKA phosphorylation sites of interest. We will
examine the role of specific brain PDE4 isozymes in these alcohol-related behaviors using PDE4 isozyme-
selective inhibitors and knockout mice. We will also determine whether b3 and β1 subunits associate with
specific PDE4 isoforms by isolating GABAA receptor complexes using Blue Native PAGE and analyzing them
with mass spectrometry (LS-MS/MS). Finally, we will test the hypothesis that a b1-selective, positive allosteric
modulator (PAM) alone or in combination with apremilast will reduce alcohol tolerance and alcohol
consumption. These experiments will characterize a new series of 10 novel compounds targeting b1-containing
GABAA receptors using receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, to identify a b1-selective PAM with
properties suitable for testing in mice."

 1 Merkel cell carcinoma MCC is an often-lethal skin cancer with increasing incidence and few treatment
 2 options. The dismal five-year survival rate of advanced MCC is less than 18% and the mortality rate is 3-times
 3 higher than melanoma. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become standard of care in advanced
 4 MCC, 50% of all MCC patients are ineligible for ICIs and resistance develops in the majority of treated patients.
 5 Importantly, there is no therapeutic alternative for these patients. Given this urgent clinical demand, our long-
 6 term goal is to identify novel therapies which can be used to augment ICI efficacy and overcome ICI resistance,
 7 or to serve as alternative treatments for MCC patients who are ineligible for ICIs. Utilizing MCC cell lines
 8 established in our laboratory and high throughput dose-response drug screening of 430 clinically relevant
9 kinase inhibitors, we identified fimepinostat, the first-in-class PI3K/HDAC inhibitor, with potent anti-MCC
10 activities. The objective of this proposal is to determine therapeutic efficacy of fimepinostat alone and in
11 combination with ICIs, and resolve intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of anti-MCC activities. The central
12 hypothesis is that fimepinostat inhibits MCC growth and progression by targeting PI3K and HDAC epigenetic
13 pathways, and by sensitizing tumor cells to ICIs through augmentation of antitumor immunity in the MCC
14 microenvironment. We will test this hypothesis by utilizing systems-level approaches integrating cellular,
15 molecular and imaging analyses in single cell resolution to fully study the functional complexity of the MCC
16 ecosystem in our clinically relevant animal model representing the closest preclinical models of human MCC-
17 immune microenvironment. This singularly powerful biological platform will enable us to study direct effects of
18 fimepinostat on tumors and tumor-immune interactions as a monotherapy and in combination with
19 immunotherapy, as well as uncover new insights into TME-mediated resistance and response. The proposed
20 research is significant because successful completion of the project will lay foundation for a new treatment
21 paradigm for MCC, overcoming or circumventing current limitations in therapeutic options, and lending insights
22 into immune resistance will be applicable across human cancers and improve patient outcomes."
10873901,"A growing body of evidence suggests that metformin effects on mitochondria are responsible for its ability to
lower blood glucose and reduce the growth and incidence of cancer. In model systems, metformin prolongs
lifespan, and observational studies in humans similarly suggest a longevity benefit for patients who take
metformin. In spite of recent progress in the biology of metformin action, the mechanisms by which metformin
exacts favorable effects on longevity and aging remain incompletely characterized. Our recent work provides
evidence that metformin targets multiple, fundamental aspects of the aging process. In particular, we have
shown that metformin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial energetics restrains transport through the nuclear
pore complex (NPC). Restrained NPC transport locks the pro-aging kinase mTORC1 in the inactive state. It is
known that many cells obtain a “leaky” nucleus as they age, and our work is the first suggestion that metformin
can target this leakiness through action on mitochondria. Our preliminary data and published studies indicate
that metformin can also target mitochondrial leakiness that is mechanistically linked to aging. These exciting
observations suggest that metformin is positioned to reverse multiple, pathological cellular changes that occur
with aging. In doing so, the drug is poised to fulfill the geroscience principle: by reversing fundamental aspects
of the aging process, metformin may target not one but many aging-associated diseases simultaneously. In
spite of this tantalizing possibility, critical gaps in our knowledge remain that prevent us from fully realizing the
therapeutic potential of metformin. In which tissues is metformin action needed to promote longevity? How are
metformin effects at mitochondria transduced to effectors that mediate the drug’s geroprotective effects? What
is the full spectrum of molecular events required for metformin effects in aging? The overall objective of this
application is to determine the sites and mechanisms of metformin action in aging. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that metformin promotes healthy aging by targeting mitochondrial energetics in specific tissues,
which signals through downstream effector pathways to promote longevity. The rationale for this work is that
completion of the project will illuminate both specific effector sites of the drug and unexpected elements of the
metformin response pathway. In Aim 1 we will define mechanisms by which metformin targets mitochondria to
promote longevity. Aim 2 will characterize mechanisms by which metformin reduces mitochondrial permeability
in aging. In Aim 3, we will probe a larger landscape of metformin response genes in order to understand the full
spectrum of metformin’s direct and indirect cellular effects in aging. This project is significant because it will
elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which biguanides mediate their positive effects on lifespan. We put
forth conceptual and technical innovations that will allow discovery of the most important aspects of the
response to metformin. Successful completion of this project will pave the way for a new generation of
strategies that can promote healthy aging and reduce the onset and severity of aging-related diseases."

The overarching goal of this training program is to train the next generation of pain researchers. We will continue
to train both pre- (two per year) and post-doctoral (two per year) fellows in the fundamental principles of pain, as
nociceptive signals arise and are modulated throughout the body and ultimately integrated in the brain to produce
the sensory and emotional experience. We will continue to build on the training program developed through the
first funding period of this grant around a combination of more formal coursework and less formal training
experiences designed to provide not only a solid background in pain mechanisms and management, and a
greater appreciation of the burden of pain, but in a variety of skills critical for career development including the
use of cutting edge methodology, networking, presentations to both lay and expert audiences, and writing. We
are committed to an integrated approach to the study of pain which is based on our belief that major
breakthroughs in this field can only be achieved through multidisciplinary approaches. This is most clearly
manifest in practice through interactions between [1] laboratories (horizontal integration) and [2] researchers and
clinicians (vertical integration). Accordingly, horizontal and vertical integration are essential components of this
training program, which consists of three core elements:
1) Research - Multidisciplinary research projects are not only encouraged, but expected, as is exposure to clinical
management of pain/pain-related problems. Horizontal and vertical integration will be achieve both through the
choice of project, shaped by a primary mentor with input from the executive committee, and through the formation
of multidisciplinary mentoring committees which will include at least one clinical faculty member among a three
to four-member committee.
2) Theory - Trainees participate in four required for-credit courses: Mechanisms and Clinical Presentation of
Pain, Pain Journal Club, bi-weekly Current Research on Pain presentations, and Pain Models – Rationale,
Testing and Interpretation, as well as the monthly Pain Seminar Series, where trainees interact with prominent
pain researchers. These courses serve as a primary venue to address issues of scientific rigor and responsibility
as well as reinforce issues associated with the responsible conduct of research. Post-doctoral trainees will obtain
additional training through their participation in the patient/family education program developed by the chronic
pain clinic and offered every six weeks as an educational resource for pain patients and families.
3) Practice - Trainees will be exposed to the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain patients
through two (and for post-docs three) primary venues: 1) The last third of the course Mechanisms of Clinical
Presentation of Pain is directed at assessment diagnosis and treatment of specific subpopulations/aspects of
pain patients (visceral, headache, geriatric, etc); 2) in the course Pain Perspectives trainees shadow pain
physicians as they interview, diagnose and manage pain patients; and 3) Post-docs participate in the
presentation of didactic material to Regional and Chronic Pain Fellows, as well as participate in the semi-annual
pain management forum for all fellows (clinical and basic) in pain related training programs."
10882527,"Project Summary/Abstract Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10-to-24-year-olds in the United
States1-2, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) in adolescents are prevalent and increase risk of death by
suicide3-5. Nearly half of adolescents who die by suicide contact a primary care clinician within one month prior
to suicide14, making routinely accessed pediatric primary care (PC) settings a clear target for reducing
adolescent suicide. Unfortunately, many PC providers are reluctant to manage STB in PC, resulting in many
PC providers triaging youth with any STB to the Emergency Department (ED)19-22. While EDs are an important
resource, ED visits are often poorly equipped to handle mental health24 and most youth with STBs are
discharged home with minimal mental health support. Consequently, there is a critical need to adapt evidence-
based, responsive, just-in-time suicide prevention interventions for use in PC27-29. This would likely enhance
clinician’s comfort with STB screening and would enhance access to higher level services through reducing
unnecessary referrals for STB. The development, implementation, and adoption of comprehensive STB
services (screening, brief intervention, care appropriate referral) in PC would fill an important service gap,
reduce healthcare spending, and, critically, reduce suicides38-39. This K23 proposal aims to fill this gap by
taking an innovative, user-centered design approach40 to adapt and optimize a brief, evidence-based suicide
intervention, SAFETY-Acute33-34 (SAFETY-A; formerly known as Family Intervention for Suicide Prevention –
aka FISP33-34), for use in PC to support PC management of adolescents with low to moderate STB. The
candidate proposes training in development/adaptation of suicide prevention interventions for youth and
families, inclusive of training in implementation science, user centered design, and advanced mixed-methods
approaches and analyses with health-systems to carry out the following proposed study aims, partnering with
diverse pediatric PC practices in Western Washington: (1) Conduct contextual inquiry to assess needs of PC
staff, patients, and parents for suicide prevention services in PC, including context of use, barriers, and
facilitators that impact STB screening, intervention, and referral within PC. (2) Based on data from Aim 1,
design and build a SAFETY-A based STB model of care prototype for PC, via rapid prototyping and usability
refinement with PC stakeholders (PC staff, patients, parents). (3) Pilot test the STB model of care, compared to
treatment as usual, with 3 PC clinics, including 48 10–18-year-old patients with STB and their parents (16
dyads per clinic). Using self-report, interview, and clinic medical record and administrative data, assess
acceptability and feasibility of (a) the STB model of care and (b) the research protocol, and (c) preliminary
intervention impacts and need for further adaptation. The proposed project will yield pilot data to inform a larger
R01 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the intervention."
10882650,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant factor predisposing chronic kidney disease (CKD), however the factors
mediating CKD progression are not clear. T-helper 17 cells (Th17) represent a primary lymphocyte population
and may play a central role in coordinating immune and renal cell activity in AKI and subsequent CKD induced
by exposure to high salt diet. Studies from the recent project period demonstrated that impairment of IL17
activity attenuates both AKI and progression of CKD and hypertension. We also demonstrated the dependence
of Th17 activity on the store-operated calcium channel, Orai1. However, there remains important questions
regarding Th17 effects on AKI and CKD. First, the phenotype Th17 cells at different stages of AKI or CKD is
not known; second, the physiological regulatory factors modulate Th17 reactivation associated with CKD are
not defined; third, the effect of Th17 activity on the variety of potential renal cell targets is incompletely
defined. We hypothesize that the dynamic regulation of Th17 cells plays a central role in the development of
kidney injury, repair and progression to chronic kidney disease. We propose that Ca2+ signaling stimulated by
high-salt diet increases the pathogenicity of Th17 cells by changing their cytokine profile, and further propose
that the pleiotropic activity Th17 cytokines such as IL17A and GM-CSF alters parenchymal, innate, and
adaptive immune cell function to promote kidney injury. Aim 1 of the proposal will utilize IL17A reporter mice
to more completely define the phenotype and localization of Th17 cells using FACS, imaging tissue cytometry
and evaluate spatial distribution of Th17 with developing tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). A Th17 fate-
tracing model will be used to characterize whether quiescent Th17 cells following recovery from AKI, express
the Orai1- Ca2+ channel, contribute T-memory populations, differentiate to other T-helper populations, or are
essential for the reactivation of Th17 cells during progression of CKD. Finally, we will determine if inhibition of
these pathways using an FDA approved SOCC blocker following the establishment of AKI during the recovery
phase, impairs the secondary activation of Th17 cells associated with progression of CKD. In aim 2, we will
expand studies to define alterations in the transcriptional signature of Th17 cells during progressive CKD
induced by high salt diet. In addition, we will determine how inhibition of the Th17 pathway by pharmacological
and gene knockout approaches affects immune and renal cell transcriptional responses to injury and
investigate specific alterations in B-cells and formation of TLS. Finally, we will examine the potential
contribution of GM-CSF, a factor co-secreted byTh17 cells, during AK and the AKI to CKD transition."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common but poorly understood disease with a critical need for
improved diagnosis and treatment. It is the most common form of chronic liver disease manifested as a spectrum
of hepatic abnormalities ranging from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis and cirrhosis in the
absence of excessive alcohol consumption. During the present grant cycle, we have used an approach termed
“systems genetics” to identify genetic and environmental interactions in NAFLD. Using omics technologies, we
directly examined the effects of genetic variation on molecular phenotypes, such as global transcript, protein, or
metabolite levels. This enables the identification of causal genes and pathways and the modeling of higher order
interactions in the disease process. We validated two key driver genes, matrix gla protein (Mgp) and insulin-like
growth factor binding protein 4 (Igfbp4) as causal genes in vivo by showing that experimental modulation of their
expression led to significant reduction in liver fibrosis in mice. In Aim 1a, we will examine the role of Mgp in
hepatic stellate cells (HSC) physiology by using HSC-specific knockout mice. In Aim 1b, we will use the Four
Core Genotypes mouse model to dissect the respective role of gonadal hormones and sex-chromosomes in
conferring sex-specific protection of NASH in the Mgp knockout mice. In Aim 1c, we will investigate the
mechanisms by which Igfbp4 alters NASH using inducible overexpression and knockout mice. Additionally, its
role in TGF-β and SMAD pathways will be examined. Our single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed potential
cell-cell interactions important for liver fibrosis. We observed significant information flow from various liver cell
types to HSC during the onset of liver fibrosis. In Aim 2a, we will examine the role of these interactions in HSC
function using primary HSC. In Aim 2b, we will examine intercellular communication between HSC and other
liver cell types by 3D liver spheroid culture. Plasma metabolomic analysis showed that circulating indole-3-
propionic acid (IPA) levels were lower in NASH patients with liver fibrosis and that IPA levels were significantly
correlated with liver transcripts enriched in HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis signaling. The links among IPA,
cellular NAD+ levels and gut microbiota will be the focus for investigation in Aim 3. IPA will be supplemented in
mice to test the hypothesis that IPA protects the liver from NASH by increasing NAD+ levels in hepatocytes (Aim
3a). We will use knockout mice of two NAD+ catabolizing enzymes, namely nicotinamide N-methyl transferase
(NNMT) and CD38, to examine the link between NAD+ levels and NASH (Aim 3b). To test the causal links
between gut bacterial IPA production and host phenotypes, we will perform gnotobiotic studies with germ-free
mice. The hypothesis that perturbating IPA levels through transplantation of genetically engineered bacteria into
germ-free mice will lead to altered nicotinamide and NASH development will be tested in Aim 3c. Taken together,
these comprehensive and complementary approaches in humans and mice will provide important mechanistic
insight into genetic and environmental factors causal for NASH."
10883111,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kir3 or GIRK (G protein gated inwardly rectifying K+) channel isoforms are expressed in multiple
parts of the body, including the atria of the heart (GIRK1, 4) and platelets (GIRK1, 2, 4). In the
heart, activation by the vagus nerve slows down heart rate. GIRKs are critical determinants of
heart rate variability (HRV), an index of cardiac health, endowing the heart with the adaptability it
needs to make rapid adjustments in heart rate. GIRK channels are attractive drug targets against
atrial fibrillation (Afib), the most common arrhythmia. In the last cycle of this grant, we showed
that increased Afib prevalence with age results from constitutive activation of PKC by the
oxidative conditions of aging, which phosphorylates GIRK4 channels to increase their activity,
leading to an increased risk of mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction. Additionally, the lack
of specificity of the current antiarrhythmics used poses significant risk for ventricular side effects.
This makes rather attractive targets expressed predominantly in the atria, like GIRK channels.
Yet the lack of specific and partial inhibitors of GIRK activity in the atria that could reverse Afib,
but not inhibit HRV, have been challenging to make. During vascular injury, P2Y12 receptor
stimulation activates GIRKs to somehow result in generation of the lipid thromboxane A2 that
amplifies platelet activation and recruitment of additional platelets to the site of injury to form clots
and stop or prevent bleeding. Even though P2Y12R is the target of efficacious anti-thrombotic
drugs, the lack of understanding of GIRK biology in platelet activation and the lack of specific
GIRK inhibitors has stalled targeting them for anti-thrombotic effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we utilize state-of-the-art computational approaches to design drugs that target specific GIRK
isoforms at either of two sites, transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CP) ones and couple
preferentially to either of the two channel gates, the membrane (M) and the cytosolic (C). In Aim
2a, we use these powerful probes to find the balance between reversing Afib and maintaining
HRV, thus aiming to address the unmet medical need for GIRK-isoform specific partial inhibitors.
In Aim 2b, we also use them to decipher the involvement of GIRKs in platelet-mediated
thrombosis. The complementary expertise of the three labs make this a unique team. The

The NIH has declared that developing new non-addictive treatments for chronic pain is one of its top priorities.
Certain polyunsaturated fatty acids are precursors to oxylipins that regulate pain pathways. Oxylipins derived
from omega-6 (n-6) linoleic acid tend to have pro-nociceptive properties, while oxylipins derived from omega-3
eicosapentaenoic acid (n-3 EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) tend to have anti-nociceptive
properties. Because humans cannot synthesize n-3 and n-6 fatty acids de novo, the levels of these fatty
acids—and their oxylipin derivatives—can be altered by diet. We have published results of two randomized
controlled trials testing targeted dietary modification of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (H3L6 diet) among adults with
chronic headache (n=67) and migraine (n=182) reporting reductions in headache of 25-40% and reduction in
NSAID use. The H3L6 diet altered the concentration of circulating n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and their oxylipin
derivatives, and these changes predicted improvement in headache. These results suggest that the H3L6 diet
is a promising adjunct treatment for reducing headache and a useful model for investigating mechanisms of
pain reduction. Preclinical studies suggest that oxylipin modification could be efficacious in other chronic pain
conditions characterized by neuronal sensitization and inflammation, but this has not been demonstrated in
humans. We have pilot data (n=40) supporting feasibility and reduced pain intensity in adults with chronic
lumbosacral radiculopathy randomized to the H3L6 vs control diet. We propose to conduct a 16-week
randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy and biochemical mechanisms of the H3L6 diet among adults
receiving usual care for chronic axial low back pain. We hypothesize that increasing dietary n-3 EPA+DHA
while lowering n-6 linoleic acid will alter nociceptive oxylipins in a manner that decreases the intensity of back
pain as well as pain medication use. The goal of this R34 planning grant is to develop all the necessary
documents and procedures to conduct that trial. In Aim 1, we will update the H3L6 and control interventions to
current nutrient values since the food supply has changed since they were developed. In Aim 2, we will
complete all the planning activities (e.g., preparation of the manual of operating procedures, development of
informed consent forms, and develop safety and data management plan) that are critical prior to implementing
a clinical trial. Completion of this aim will take care of all requirements in the NIAMS Clinical Trial Planning
Milestone Checklist and will facilitate the launching of a trial that is hypothesis-driven and milestone-
defined. The proposed project is part of a series of studies designed to translate the preclinical and clinical
research on oxylipin-pain pathways into accessible, effective, non-addictive treatments for chronic pain. Based
on our previous work, this approach of using dietary modifications to alter biochemical regulators of chronic
pain is a low-risk, high-reward endeavor potentially leading to new treatment options and biomarkers of
treatment response."

Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of hemorrhagic stroke that affects ~500,000 people annually world-
wide and causes significant mortality and long-term disability. Severe cerebral edema (CE) occurs in ~30-40%
of SAH and contributes to poor long-term outcomes. Although CE has been implicated as an important
pathophysiologic process after SAH, CE targeted therapeutics have not been explored. In this proposal, we
address important barriers to the development of therapies targeting CE by 1) using a Dual-energy CT (DECT)
based method for measuring brain water content (BWC) to develop a validated measure of CE after SAH and 2)
identifying the role of miR-335-3p and miR-5585-5p in the mechanisms of CE after SAH. We have previously
developed surrogate markers of CE using sulcal effacement measurements on computed tomography (CT)
scans [Selective Sulcal Volume (SSV) and the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Early Brain Edema Score (SEBES)].
Using these markers, combined with miRNA and proteomic analyses, our preliminary data show elevated
miRNAs (miR-335p and miR-5585) and decreased proteins (including SCARA5, GPNMB, and NTRK2) in SAH
patients with severe sulcal effacement. These miRNAs are predicted to downregulate Na+/K+ATPase (NKATP)
expression as well as the proteins found to be decreased after SAH. NKATP is important for maintenance of
cellular membrane potential and has been shown to be downregulated after SAH. Disruption of NKATP has been
shown to cause cellular swelling which can lead to CE. Our preliminary data shows elevations in miR-335 and
miR-5585, decreased Na/K ATPase α-1 subunit (an essential subunit of NKATP) and increased cellular edema
in an in vitro SAH model. We also found miR-335 and miR-5585 elevations in brain tissue in an in vivo model
with associated CE measured by MRI and ex-vivo methods. Despite the utility of SSV and SEBES, these markers
only measure the sulcal spaces in the brain and are indirect measures of CE, limiting their utility. We have found
that CE can be measured in brain parenchyma using DECT. This measure of brain parenchymal water content
will address the limitations of indirect markers. We will employ a “bed-to-bench” approach, where a combination
of DECT BWC techniques, plasma/cerebrospinal fluid samples and in vivo and in vitro models will be used to
test the following specific aims. Aim 1 will test whether BWC is predictive of in-hospital complications and long-
term outcomes. We will test if miR-335 and miR-5585 (markers of sulcal effacement) are also markers of BWC
and if they are predictive of clinical outcomes. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism of miR-335 and miR-5585
related CE and if antagonism can ameliorate their detrimental effects in an in vitro and in vivo model. We will
perform the clinical study across two centers: UTHealth Houston and University of Maryland Medical Center.
The completion of our proposal will establish a validated radiographic technique that represents CE and identify
miRNA mediated pathways that can be targeted for future clinical trials to improve outcomes."

High SERPINB3 is a biomarker of radioresistance, and a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. Our
recent work demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 knock out of SERPINB3, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases,
sensitized cervical tumor cells to radiation therapy (RT)-induced cell death. In vivo targeting of SERPINB3 with
siRNA not only altered the tumor microenvironment, but significantly sensitized SERPINB3-high tumor models
to RT. Importantly, we established that tumor cells died via lysoptosis, a newly described and evolutionarily
conserved mode of cell death that is dependent upon lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and leakage
of potent proteases into the cytoplasm. SERPINB3-KO tumor cells underwent widespread lysoptosis when
treated with a variety of cytotoxic agents and chemotherapies. This suggests that loss of SERPINB3 exposed
lysoptosis as a default cell death mechanism in these cells. The molecular features of tumor cells that are
susceptible to RT-induced LMP and lysoptosis are unknown. Validation that lysoptosis leads directly to tumor
control is required. Additionally, the mechanism through which RT induces LMP is unknown. New unpublished
data suggest that SERPINB3-high tumors have a distinct molecular signature characterized by enrichment of
lysosome-related pathways. In these cells, LMP occurs soon after treatment with clinically relevant doses of RT,
while lysosomal rupture occurs days later just prior to cell death. Finally, we have identified candidate small
molecules that bind specifically to SERPINB3. The long-term goal of this work is to define new treatment
approaches for radioresistant SERPINB3-high tumors. This proposal tests the hypothesis that targeting
SERPINB3 in SERPINB3-high tumor cells renders them susceptible to RT-induced lysoptosis, and that LMP is
the initiating event that results from unrepaired lysosomal damage. Three aims are proposed to directly address
this hypothesis: Aim 1: Determine the predominant cell death mechanism induced by RT in SERPINB3-high
tumors; Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of therapy-induced LMP leading to lysoptosis; Aim 3: Identify
SERPINB3-targeting strategies that specifically sensitize tumor cells and not normal cells to RT. To accomplish
these aims, we propose to use ex vivo organelle-based approaches, step-wise in vitro and in vivo analysis of
cell death mechanisms leading to tumor control, and an innovative pre-clinical brachytherapy system that we
have developed to mimic treatment delivered in the clinic. Success of this proposal will confirm that SERPINB3
is a predictive biomarker for lysoptosis-inducing CRT strategies, generate new knowledge of the critical events
leading to RT-induced LMP and cell death, and provide innovative therapeutic strategies to target SERPINB3
and improve survival for patients with cervical cancer using a personalized treatment approach."

 One-third of all cancer related deaths world-wide result from gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including
colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic cancer (PC). Soberingly, 50,000 Americans die every year from CRC alone,
despite the majority of these being curable if detected early. Current screening for CRC saves lives but is limited
by cost, patient non-compliance, chance of serious complications and operator dependent sensitivity. There is
no population screening for PC and so patients are often diagnosed late, at which point effective treatment
options are very limited. It is essential to develop more convenient, affordable and effective techniques to
diagnose and prevent GI carcinogenesis. The goal of this project is to develop whole-cell, living biosensors
capable of detecting tumors within the gastrointestinal system and responding with a diagnostic output. In proof-
of-concept work described here in our progress report, we developed a living bacterial biosensor that can detect
engineered target DNA naturally released in situ from orthotopic tumors in the mouse colon. We also developed
a DNA-sensing circuit to detect and report on arbitrary target DNA sequences, with the ability to distinguish
single-base mutations, including important oncogenic variants such as KRAS G12D. This work will be published
in Science, an indicator of the excitement and promise engendered by our fundamental research advance, as
the first demonstration of rationally engineered bacteria capable of detecting and analyzing DNA of interest. We
foresee the application of our system wherever DNA defines illness, sampling is challenging and diagnostic (and
therapeutic) outputs are best delivered at the time and place of disease detection. In this project, we will improve
upon this technology and progress towards clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will identify naturally competent,
endogenous gut microbes. A. baylyi is an excellent DNA biosensor chassis for in vitro applications, but it is not
an anaerobe, and we hypothesize sensing in the gut would benefit from using a native resident of the gut tumor
microbiome. In Aim 2, we will improve DNA-sensing circuits for cancer mutations, by optimizing the genetic
circuitry for the bacterial host, reducing background mutation rates, and adding multiplex detection of additional
hotspot mutations to expand detection to common PC associated DNA variants. In Aim 3, we will deliver a
diagnostic, urine-detectable output upon sensing tumor DNA or blood. In Aim 4, we will systematically
characterize the performance of our newly optimised biosensors in the complex environment of the GI tract in
vivo, using orthotopic mouse models of CRC and PC that recapitulate human disease. The result of this project
will be whole-cell, living biosensors capable of detecting GI cancers in situ and responding with a diagnostic
output. This will in the future provide valuable, non-invasive diagnostics to enable screening for PC, and that are
far less onerous for the patient than colonoscopy to detect CRC. The motivation is to increase participation in
screening, catch GI cancers in earlier stages, decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes."

Declared a top ten threat to global health by the World Health Organization in 2019, vaccine hesitancy
continues to be a major problem, as highlighted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 and influenza
are both respiratory viral illnesses that result in a substantial number of vaccine-preventable illnesses,
hospitalizations, and deaths due to suboptimal vaccine uptake in the United States (US). There are major
disparities in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake according to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
These disparities contribute to the disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 and influenza illness among
these vulnerable populations, with higher rates of COVID-19 and influenza related hospitalizations and deaths
among individuals of racial/ethnic minorities, non-US born populations, and low socioeconomic status.
Effective strategies are urgently needed to increase COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among vulnerable
populations. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the impact of a highly promising approach, motivational
interviewing, on COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy among vulnerable adults. Building on experience
training providers in MI and ongoing work supporting PCPs in addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, we will
develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative motivational interviewing training program specific to COVID-
19 and influenza vaccination for PCPs who care for adult patients in and near Worcester, MA. The training
program will include: (1) a video module introducing providers to key principles of MI and presumptive
recommendations for vaccination; (2) opportunities to practice MI skills and receive feedback using an
innovative Video-based Communication Assessment (VCA) platform; and (3) provider reference sheets with
suggested responses to common concerns. We will implement and evaluate the intervention at three clinical
systems via a large pragmatic clinical trial. The clinical systems include UMass Memorial Health Care
(UMMHC) and two Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which collectively serve large populations of
racial/ethnic minority groups, non-US born individuals, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. Our
specific aims are: (1) To develop a motivational interviewing training program for PCPs to address COVID-19
and influenza vaccine hesitancy among adult patients; (2) To implement and assess the impact of the MI
training on COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake through a large, pragmatic cluster randomized trial; and (3)
To evaluate the intervention according to the RE-AIM framework, incorporating the perspectives of patients
and primary care providers. This research will generate urgently needed evidence for training PCPs to
communicate effectively with vaccine hesitant adult patients. By developing an efficient and scalable platform
for training PCPs in MI, this research will also catalyze the use of MI to promote a range of health-related
behavior changes."

The objective of this RLI-S10 proposal is to acquire an electrophoresis imaging system, to enhance research and
teaching capabilities at the Western Kentucky University (WKU). An imaging system is a basic requirement in
the field of biological sciences which is commonly used for visualization, documentation and analysis of gel
electrophoresis and western blotting techniques used for DNA and protein detections. In the Department of
Biology at WKU, several investigators work on research projects that routinely need this instrument.
Additionally, several molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory courses use gel imaging system
throughout the semester for experimental analysis. These research and teaching laboratories provide hands-on
learning opportunities which can substantially enhance research quality and learning experience of a large
number of undergraduate students.
The users on this application are actively engaged in research funded by internal and external funding agencies
and have expertise with research capabilities to engage students in a wide variety of biomedical research using
different model systems and experimental analyses. The users seek funds through this proposal to replace their
18-year-old imager, Fluorchem HD2 which has limited imaging capabilities and is becoming increasingly
difficult to operate as it only runs on computers with Windows 7 that are becoming more and more scarce and
are not updatable. Moreover, the manufacturer is no longer supporting this gel imager, thus making it difficult
to change different parts of the old imager. The lack of a modern, high-resolution, functional imaging system
effects the quality of data and reliability of analyses in education and research. The acquisition of a new
ChemDoc MP imaging system from Bio-Rad with up-to-date digital imaging capability will equip researchers,
educators, and students at WKU, the ability to obtain higher resolution images of DNA and protein gels with
greater depth and accuracy.
This imaging system will be housed in the Biotechnology Center at WKU and will be available as a shared
resource that will provide several learning and training opportunities for the student community across different
departments and majors at our primarily undergraduate institute. It will enable the diverse undergraduate
population to use basic laboratory equipment and gain skills in producing high quality research data. The
equipment will fulfill the imaging needs for four different research laboratories and five different teaching
laboratories wherein undergraduate students will gain valuable firsthand learning experience through the use
of the instrument at our institute."

 The goal of this application is to train Dr. David Nguyen PhD MD, an infectious disease clinician and
medical engineer, with the skills necessary to become an independently-funded investigator studying,
diagnosing, and eventually curing genetic diseases of the immune system. Primary immunodeficiency (PID)
disease is commonly recognized as an inability of the immune system to develop, self-regulate, or fight infection
due to a genetic defect in some aspect of the normal immune response. Gene therapy is a possibility to cure
PID disease once a patient's mutation can be identified, but there is incomplete knowledge of the genetic
underpinnings of PID. PID-causative mutations often remain undiagnosed despite state-of-the-art genomic
sequencing efforts because of an inability to separate benign sequence variations from the truly pathologic
mutations. This research plan addresses key limitations in the ability to provide a molecular diagnosis and cure
for PID patients. Dr. Nguyen will utilize recently developed advanced CRISPR-gene editing tools in innovative
ways to study PID-associated mutations and understand how they lead to clinical disease. He will then develop
novel strategies for replacing PID mutations in a patient's own hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). He
aims to 1) accurately recreate and functionally test PID patient sequencing variants by replacing wild-type alleles
in (otherwise healthy) primary human immune cells, 2) utilize high-throughput functional genomics to catalogue
all possible mutations in key PID-associated genes that could lead to immune dysfunction, 3) improve site-
specific gene correction in primary HSPCS.
 The proposed a 5-year career development and training plan incorporates didactic lecture-based
learning, mentored practical training, and career advising to complement Dr. Nguyen's expertise in ways that are
critical to completion of his research and career goals. He will receive instruction in advanced human T cell and
HSPC biology, functional genomics methods in particular next-generation sequencing techniques and
manipulation of large datasets, and pre-clinical development of cell and gene therapies. He will be training at
UCSF, a center for both basic and translational research that provides an excellent environment supporting
physician-scientists with local experts in all aspects the proposed research and training goals. He will be closely
mentored by Dr. Alexander Marson, a leading expert in using CRISPR gene editing to understand the genetic
basis of human immune function, and Dr. Jennifer Puck, a world-leader in the diagnostics, genetics, clinical care,
and gene therapy of severe combined immunodeficiency. The long-term goal of this study is to provide Dr.
Nguyen with the skills required to become a R01-funded faculty member leading efforts to identify, functionally
validate, and correct immunodeficiency patient mutations."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease lacking effective treatment options. PDA is
characterized by a dense and fibrotic tumor microenvironment deposited by extensive and diverse fibroblast
and immune cell populations within this niche. The diversity of cell types within PDA tumors also extends to
cancer cells themselves, as heterogenous subpopulations of cancer cells are capable of symbiotic behaviors
that support resistance to therapy. Accordingly, targeting crosstalk interactions can remove barriers to allow
more effective clinical treatment. Investigating clonal PDA behaviors, we have identified two metabolic
subpopulations differentiated by their sensitivity to mitochondrial inhibition. Metabolic exchange between these
populations confers resistance mediated by asparagine that is overproduced and released through a
constitutively active integrated stress response in the insensitive clones. Further, we observed that degradation
of asparagine functions to sensitize PDA to mitochondrial inhibitors. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism in
PDA cells functions to lower intercellular nucleotide pools that compete with standard of care chemotherapy,
pyrimidine anti-metabolites. Further, targeting mitochondrial metabolism also functions to reduce the anti-
inflammatory polarization of tumor-associated macrophages that provide non-cell autonomous
chemoresistance. This research proposal will target factors underpinning the programming of PDA cells that
produce and release asparagine (Aim 1). We have identified oncogenic and stress pathways that can be
targeted to impair the survival of asparagine producing cells and disrupt metabolic crosstalk. Further, we have
identified that asparagine producing PDA cells have hypermethylated histones that correlate with a
mesenchymal state. Accordingly, we will leverage metabolic approaches to normalize the histone methylation
and reprogram these cells to desensitize them to mitochondrial inhibition. In parallel, we will combine treatment
of mitochondrial inhibitors potentiated through asparagine degradation and with standard of care
chemotherapy (Aim 2). Both systemic and local asparagine levels will be targeted and compared for efficacy in
enhancing mitochondrial inhibitors. These experiments will be performed in multiple human and murine tumor
models, and analyzed through a combination of techniques that will allow for in vivo assessment of PDA
metabolic subtype response to therapy. Finally, we will characterize the remodeling of the immune and stromal
compartments of PDA tumors in response to mitochondrial inhibitors potentiated by asparagine degradation to
identify new immune targeting approaches. Together, these data will provide important insights into
mechanisms that maintain cancer cell heterogeneity and generate important pre-clinical data examining the
impact of targeting metabolic crosstalk pathways to enhance PDA response to therapy."

 Overconsumption of food and reduced physical activity cause obesity, but limited
understanding of the neuronal systems regulating these behaviors has hindered development of
therapies to support weight loss. Intriguingly, injecting the neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts) into the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain suppresses feeding and promotes physical activity, the
ideal combination of behaviors for reducing weight. These effects are likely mediated via the
subset of dopamine neurons within the VTA that express Neurotensin Receptor-1 (NtsR1) and
indeed, activating these neurons in obese mice restrains feeding, increases physical activity, and
causes weight loss. Taken together, these data suggest that augmenting Nts-NtsR1 signaling via
the VTA may be useful to safely promote weight loss. Here I will test the hypothesis that
endogenous or pharmacological enhancement of Nts-NtsR1 signaling will promote weight loss
behaviors. In Aim 1 I will augment endogenous Nts input to the VTA. Specifically, I will combine
NtsCre mice and optogenetics to activate lateral hypothalamic area neurotensin (LHANts) neurons
projecting to the VTA, which have been implicated in promoting weight loss. However, activating
all LHANts neurons simultaneously invokes voracious drinking (putatively via projections
elsewhere) that mitigates weight loss. My work will reveal if isolating the endogenous LHANts
VTA NtsR1 circuit can optimally promote weight loss, without invoking undesirable effects. In Aim
2 I will determine if pharmacological NtsR1 agonists promote weight loss behaviors. NtsR1 is a
G-Protein Coupled Receptor that, upon ligand binding to the receptor, can transduce intracellular
signaling via Gq-coupled and/or a ß-arrestin pathways, but it remains unclear if one or both of
these pathways potentiate weight loss effects. To assess which NtsR1 receptor signaling pathway
invokes weight loss, I will administer a general NtsR1 agonist that promotes both Gq-coupled and
ß-arrestin signaling or a compound that exclusively activates the ß-arrestin pathway. Agonists will
be delivered intra-VTA or systemically to elucidate the brain site and intracellular pathways by
which NtsR1 agonism mediates weight loss. Taken together, these data will reveal endogenous
and pharmacological mechanisms by which Nts-NtsR1 modulates body weight and may be useful
to guide future development of strategies to treat obesity."

 Primary prevention of HPV-related urogenital and oropharyngeal cancers could significantly reduce
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with these commonly occurring cancers. The vaccine
targeting oncogenic strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) can prevent HPV-related cancers if given to
girls and boys before exposure to these sexually transmitted viruses. Yet, in the United States (U.S.), more
than 10 years after introduction of the vaccine, fewer than half of the target population is vaccinated.
 The objective of this application is to evaluate the effectiveness of an implementation strategy (the
intervention) to improve optimal use of the HPV vaccine. Optimal use requires completion of the 2-dose series
before sexual debut. To this end, national recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) are to complete the 2-dose HPV vaccine series by age 13. The theory-based, multi-
component intervention was developed in collaboration with primary care providers and includes: 1) an
educational video to increase the provider’s knowledge about guideline recommendations and patient and
practice benefits of vaccination by age 13; 2) audit and feedback of vaccine coverage to increase motivation to
engage in practice change; 3) a communication strategy to improve the provider’s communication skills and
their self-efficacy to address parental hesitation; and 4) practice facilitation to support practice change to
develop a sustainable HPV vaccine delivery system. The intervention will be delivered through a series of brief
practice visits with the facilitator that occur every 1-4 weeks over 2 years. In a pilot study, the intervention was
well-accepted and resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in vaccine initiation of 19 percentage points
over 15-months.
 This promising intervention will be evaluated in a cluster-randomized trial in 20 primary care pediatric
practices in Missouri, a state with low HPV vaccine coverage. Study objectives are to 1) determine if the
intervention will increase initiation (primary outcome) and completion (secondary outcome) of the 2-dose HPV
vaccine series for preteens before their 13th birthday; 2) determine if provider motivation and improved
communication skills mediate the effectiveness of the intervention; and 3) assess factors important for scaling
including fidelity, acceptance by primary care providers and parents, and cost. Vaccine use in preteens will be
assessed at baseline, at 24 months to assess effectiveness, and at 36 months to assess if change is
sustained. For the primary analyses, aggregates of patient-level data will be used to estimate provider
behavior, extracting data from the practices’ electronic medical record."

 The T32-funded Cardiovascular Training Program at UT Southwestern has a long and illustrious history
of fostering emergence of capable and productive investigators ideally positioned for independence and success.
Indeed, our Program has an impressive track record, producing a large number of capable researchers who
continue to have substantial impact. Over this period, our institution and the Division of Cardiology have evolved
from a research emphasis heavily weighted towards basic science to one that now includes broad strength and
representation in translational science, clinical trials, population-based research, and health services and
outcomes research.
 Four years ago, we completely revamped our T32 Training Program, shrinking its size, limiting it to
postdoctoral trainees, sharpening the focus of our oversight and management, and becoming more “data driven”
in evaluating our trainees and our Program.
 Now, 4 years later, we can say that the transition has been a huge success. Our trainees are now
uncommonly productive in their research endeavors. The program is evenly balanced between basic and
clinical/translational research. Our program is now reflective of a) the growth of highly successful programs in
clinical and translational cardiovascular research at UT Southwestern over the past decade, b) our goal to
prepare the best investigators across the full spectrum of cardiovascular research, and c) the reality of the current
funding environment for basic research. Importantly, this shift in focus allowed us to better recruit MD
investigators who are co-enrolled in clinical training programs. Of note, the Internal Medicine Residency and
Cardiology Fellowships at UT Southwestern are among the strongest in the country.
 Our Cardiovascular Training Program is just that, a training program, and not a funding mechanism. Our
primary objective is to develop the next generation of transformative cardiovascular investigators by recruiting
highly talented and motivated individuals and preparing them for success in an increasingly competitive and

Ending the HIV epidemic requires achieving HIV viral load (HVL) suppression for key populations. Unhealthy
alcohol use by people with HIV (PWH) is a barrier to reaching HVL suppression at multiple stages of the HIV
care cascade. Alcohol use is common among PWH and results in lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence
and HVL suppression, mitigating the effectiveness of Treatment as Prevention (TasP), a key strategy for
preventing HIV transmission. Treating alcohol use is therefore a mechanism to support PWH with unhealthy
alcohol use along the HIV care cascade. In fact, prior studies demonstrate that interventions to reduce alcohol
use positively impact HIV outcomes. Gabapentin is efficacious for decreasing alcohol consumption and may be
an effective treatment for painful conditions, such as HIV-associated sensory neuropathies. However,
gabapentin’s role in achieving HVL suppression in this population has not been established. Our hypothesis is
that effective pharmacological alcohol treatment (i.e., gabapentin) will help PWH engage in HIV care, adhere to
ART, and achieve HVL suppression. We propose the Gabapentin to Reduce Alcohol and Improve Viral Load
Suppression (GRAIL) randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
gabapentin vs. placebo to achieve HVL suppression among PWH. The study population will be heavy drinkers
with HIV who had a detectable viral load in the past year, despite having been prescribed ART. Participants
(N=300) will be randomized 1:1 to receive either gabapentin (1800mg/day target dose) or placebo for 3
months; both arms will employ a one-time brief intervention to reduce alcohol use. GRAIL aims to 1) test the
efficacy of gabapentin versus placebo to achieve undetectable HVL at 3 months (primary outcome) and at 6 &
12 months (secondary outcomes); and 2) to assess the impact of gabapentin compared to placebo on: a)
alcohol consumption, b) pain severity, c) self-reported ART adherence, and d) engagement in HIV care, in
order to explore potential mechanisms by which gabapentin may lead to HVL suppression. This study will take
place in Russia, in a context of syndemic unhealthy alcohol use, drug use, and HIV. Our multi-disciplinary team
has an extensive track record of successfully conducting randomized clinical trials in Russia, including
pharmacological trials (e.g., gabapentin) in PWH. Russia, a setting in which HIV and heavy alcohol use are
more prevalent than in the US, will enable efficient study of intervening on alcohol use among PWH. The
knowledge gained will be applicable to populations living with HIV in the US and globally. The proposed trial of
gabapentin is significant as it employs a TasP approach to prevent transmission of HIV by targeting alcohol
use and achieving HVL suppression. If shown to be effective, this highly generalizable pragmatic approach to
TasP can be implemented in a variety of clinical settings, thus making it a practical addition to the HIV
prevention toolkit."

 The clinical use of anti-androgens such as abiraterone and enzalutamide has greatly improved prostate
cancer treatment, but patients treated with these drugs still relapse with more aggressive forms of the disease,
collectively termed as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). These forms of CRPC are characterized by
increased lineage plasticity, often associated with loss of androgen receptor (AR) expression and
neuroendocrine differentiation. Our laboratory focuses on analyses of cell type differentiation in the normal and
transformed prostate epithelium, and has recently used genetically-engineered mouse models to show that
neuroendocrine cells in CRPC arise by transdifferentiation from luminal adenocarcinoma cells. In preliminary
studies for this proposal, we have generated organoid models of CRPC from these mouse prostate tumors, and
have demonstrated by single-cell RNA sequencing that these organoids recapitulate much of the spectrum of
human CRPC, including distinct heterogeneous populations composed of AR-pathway positive prostate cancer,
neuroendocrine prostate cancer, and double-negative prostate cancer. Further analysis of these organoid lines
has revealed a complex genomic landscape of chromatin accessibility, and has identified active histone marks
that are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. These findings indicate that epigenetic reprogramming
may play a key role in the lineage plasticity of castration-resistant prostate cancer.
 Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that molecular analysis of epigenetic reprogramming
in castration-resistant prostate cancer will identify candidate drivers and mechanisms of lineage plasticity. To
investigate this hypothesis, we will pursue three innovative aims that integrate in vivo, ex vivo, molecular, and
computational systems approaches to analyze genetically-engineered mouse models, organoids, grafts, and
human prostate tumor samples. Our specific aims are as follows: (1) Analysis of lineage plasticity in CRPC
organoid and mouse models to examine potential pathways of interconversion between distinct forms of CRPC;
(2) Investigation of epigenetic pathways in CRPC organoid models by examining chromatin accessibility, histone
marks, and DNA methylation patterns to identify epigenetic marks and regulators that drive lineage plasticity;
and (3) Functional analysis of candidate regulators of lineage plasticity in CRPC using computational systems
approaches to identify candidate regulators of plasticity followed by experimental validation using organoid and
graft assays together with analyses of human tumor samples. Overall, these studies will provide essential
insights into the molecular basis of lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer, and will have
significant implications for the development of novel therapies."

The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has been at the forefront of
genomic medicine research since its establishment in 2007 and has informed national and
international research programs, including the All of Us Research Program. Integral to the
Network's success is Vanderbilt's longstanding role as a dedicated Coordinating Center
(CC). With Vanderbilt as a founding member, eMERGE pioneered the use of large scale genomic
and electronic health record (EHR) data for research, developed and validated over 60 electronic
phenotypes, integrated clinically actionable genomic data into the EHR, published over 600
manuscripts, and formed a cohort of over 135,000 adult and pediatric participants that is broadly
accessible for further discovery.
 The next phase of eMERGE will develop and return genomic risk assessments (GRA) in
diverse populations, utilizing polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict and manage the risk of
common, complex diseases. We are proposing to form the Genomic Risk Assessment
Coordinating center for eMERGE (GRACE) with the Broad Institute to add expertise in large-scale
genotyping, cloud computing, and genomic data analysis and management, and with Duke
University to leverage its proficiency in the implementation of patient-oriented family history tools
and delivery of risk assessments. To meet the needs of the Network, GRACE will continue to
serve NHGRI, the Network, and its members in all coordination, communication, and collaboration
functions while providing a nationally visible home for eMERGE authored tools and scientific
productivity. Secondly, we will assist the Network with selecting and validating polygenic risk
scores (PRS) for approximately fifteen complex diseases and developing genomic risk
assessments (GRAs) which combine the PRS with other clinical risks, family history, and
monogenic risks to individuals of diverse ancestry. Finally, we will coordinate a prospective study
for 20,000 participants which calculates clinical and genomic risks for participants and their
providers. In addition to providing the genotyping and PRS reporting services, we will develop
with the Network scalable EHR-based methods to assess uptake of risk-reduction
recommendations and clinical impact."

Although the majority of Americans with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias
(AD/ADRD) live independently, the neighborhood contexts in which they develop and navigate cognitive decline
and impairment are largely ignored. Living in neighborhoods with opportunities for social interaction (e.g., coffee
shops, senior centers), intellectual stimulation (e.g., museums, libraries) and physical activity (e.g., parks,
walkable streets) may slow rates of cognitive decline and reduce risk for AD/ADRD. However, with the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic, many neighborhood resources that are critical sources of socialization, stimulation,
and activity are closed or tightly restricted. Avoiding crowded places, isolating, limiting travel, and permanent
business closures likely have profound consequences for cognitive impairment and AD/ADRD risk due to
disruptions in daily life; impacts on mental health; and loss of opportunities for social, intellectual, and physical
activities. This research addresses a critical knowledge gap on neighborhood contexts of cognitive decline before
and after the pandemic onset. It is one of few studies to utilize both qualitative and quantitative data from the
nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of US adults aged 51+. Aim 1 (K99 phase: 2021-
23) identifies neighborhood features associated with cognitive trajectories in the HRS before the pandemic onset.
Aim 2 (R00 phase: 2023-25) uses an advanced mixed-methods approach and novel HRS experimental module
to investigate how the collective trauma of COVID-19 has fundamentally changed neighborhood landscapes and
ways of aging in place. This will inform where to focus Aim 3 analyses (R00 phase: 2024-26) to identify which
neighborhood features are associated with risk and resiliency for cognitive impairment among older adults after
the March 2020 pandemic onset. Findings will build evidence for a new concept of `cognability', an innovative
theoretical approach to indicate how supportive a geographic area is to cognitive health for aging residents
through specific neighborhood resources and amenities. The K99/R00 fellowship will facilitate Dr. Finlay's career
development and future as a successful independent health researcher. It extends her expertise in environmental
gerontology, mixed-methods, and cognitive function with advanced training in longitudinal analysis; cognitive
decline, impairment, and AD/ADRD; and acute illness among aging adults. A strong interdisciplinary mentorship
team and outstanding supportive training environment at the University of Michigan provide a foundation for Dr.
Finlay to fill an important scientific niche on neighborhood vulnerability and resilience for cognitive decline and
AD/ADRD. She has a unique vantage point to advance research on social determinants of AD/ADRD, identify
neighborhood features that affect health and well-being, and inform public health policy and health services. Her
long-term goal is to establish an R01-funded, mixed-methods research program that informs neighborhood
interventions and community services to support the needs, health, and well-being of older adults aging in place."

 Pancreatic -cells are responsible for synthesis and secretion of insulin in response to a glucose challenge.
They are essential for survival of the organism as the only cell type capable of expressing and secreting insulin.
Since they are essential, yet they have a limited capacity to replicate, it would be evolutionarily advantageous
for -cells to possess mechanisms to protect themselves from a variety of cellular stresses. The formation of
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, have been
implicated in the demise of -cells during diabetes development. Indeed, nitric oxide, produced in -cells in
response to proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IFN-γ), inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and
insulin secretion, hydrogen peroxide causes oxidation of proteins, lipids, and DNA, and both cause DNA damage
that can lead to cell death if the damage is not repaired. Furthermore, it has been suggested that -cells are
vulnerable to damage due to reportedly low levels of antioxidants; however, this view is at odds with several
fundamental characteristics of -cells. ROS are produced by the pathway responsible for glucose sensing and
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (mitochondrial oxidative metabolism), and their production is directly
proportional to the blood glucose concentration. Additionally, this pathway is sensitive to inhibition by nitric oxide.
Our central hypothesis is that, because they are essential for organism survival, β-cells are evolutionarily
programmed to be protected from damage, and our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms by which this
protection occurs. There are two aims: (1) to test the hypothesis that the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin antioxidant
system promotes β-cell survival and function, and (2) to test the hypothesis that IL-1 signaling promotes
protective responses in islet endocrine cells. Using biochemical, molecular, immunological, genetic, and omics
approaches, these studies will initiate investigations into the mechanisms by which pancreatic β-cells protect
themselves against oxidant, free radical, and environmental challenges. Proposed experiments will begin during
the K99 phase, with expertise and technical assistance provided by the mentor and advisory team at MCW, and
will be completed upon transition to the independent R00 phase. We believe that the pathways of protection that
are identified in these studies will provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention designed to preserve
functional β-cell mass and attenuate or prevent diabetes development."

necessary to advance vision health and science for the next decade and beyond. The Department of
Ophthalmology at UIC is among the leading institutions for eye care and research, ranking #9 in NIH funding in
the last fiscal year (#1 among institutions in the Midwestern United State). Since its inception in 2011, the UIC
K12/ICVS Program has fostered the academic careers of 12 Scholars. Their success is evident in 12 NIH
grants and 17 non-NIH grants as PI and over 400 peer-reviewed publications. We seek funding over the next 5
years to train 5 junior faculty as clinician-scientists in eye research. Our short-term objectives build upon these
strengths through ongoing program activities and several new initiatives. Ongoing activities include
supplementing team mentoring programs with new training and tools, optimizing existing and new UIC
partnerships, and augmenting our strong didactic curriculum. We also have three novel initiatives. First, the
Diversification of the Sciences Initiative identifies institutional and other barriers to optimal academic quality of
life among new investigators and pursues policy changes and program activities to improve recruitment,
retention, and advancement of underrepresented minorities and women. Second, we will incorporate new
curriculum content on reproducibility, transparency, and rigor, as well as the responsible conduct of research.
Lastly, we will provide training on fundamental research approaches, opportunities for hands-on bioinformatics
training, and experimental design for personalized medicine."

Regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in stress responses in nearly all bacterial
organisms that have been investigated, including pathogenic bacteria. The functions of sRNAs
are often supported by proteins such as the paradigmatic bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq.
Interestingly, only ~50% of bacteria possess a Hfq protein, despite many of these organisms,
including important human pathogens, being known to utilize sRNAs. A less well characterized
RNA chaperone called ProQ is present in a subset of Hfq-containing organisms and, like Hfq,
binds dozens of sRNAs and messenger (m)RNAs with regulatory consequences. In addition, a
pair of KH-domain proteins—KhpA and KhpB—have recently been found to act as global RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs) in several bacterial species. Their phylogenetic distribution raises the
intriguing possibility that KhpA or B proteins—or a heterodimeric complex of the two—may
support the function of sRNAs in bacteria without Hfq or ProQ proteins. While much is known
about the mechanism of Hfq-RNA interactions, significant gaps remain in our understanding of
how other bacterial RNA chaperones (e.g ProQ, KhpA and KhpB) interact with RNA to regulate
gene expression. This proposal builds on an innovative genetic approach to probe RNA-protein
interactions inside of E. coli cells with a transcription-based bacterial three-hybrid (B3H) assay.
This assay can detect interactions in the native context of a bacterial cytoplasm and offers a
straightforward genetic approach to both identify and assess the consequences of mutations in
RBPs with molecular phenotypes of interest. The long-term goal of the PI’s laboratory is to
understand the molecular mechanisms by which RNA chaperones interact with sRNAs and
mRNAs to drive bacterial gene regulation. This proposal aims to extend the capabilities of the
B3H assay to address current limitations of the system. Aim 1 will adapt constructs to support co-
expression of multiple heterologous proteins that may collaborate in RNA interaction. Aim 2 will
develop versatile options to precisely control how bait RNAs are synthesized and presented in
the cell. As part of both aims, newly developed constructs will allow important biological questions
to be addressed—from characterizing KH-domain proteins from multiple bacterial species to
dissecting ProQ’s interactions with mRNAs. The proposed research is innovative because it
approaches the analysis of bacterial RBPs through the development and application of a unique
genetic methodology with the potential to be a useful tool for many in the field. The project is
significant as knowledge gained about mechanisms of bacterial RNA-protein interactions will
increase the potential of RNA chaperones to serve as therapeutic targets for bacterial infections."

Nucleosomes cover most of the eukaryotic genome and present a barrier for the competent binding of many
regulatory proteins that control gene expression. A special set of transcription factors called pioneer factors can
bind their target sites on nucleosomal DNA, loosen chromatin, and promote the activity of other chromatin factors
and enzymes, leading to nucleosome repositioning and gene activation. Sox2 and Oct4 are pioneer factors that
orchestrate changes in cell fate during embryogenesis and adult neurogenesis and are major players in the
reprogramming of somatic cells into a pluripotent state. Mutation and deficiency in these proteins are linked to
neurological disorders, while their enrichment is tied to cancer. Despite ample studies, little is known about how
to Sox2, Oct4 and other pioneer factors exert their pioneering activity at the molecular level. Our goal is to
address key unresolved questions about how Sox2 and Oct4 engage with nucleosomes in distinct binding modes
and alter the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes, and how these changes affect the downstream action of
chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes. Towards this goal, we propose to integrate chemical probing
assays with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to obtain site-specific structural
and dynamic information about pioneer factor interaction with nucleosomes and the perturbations they elicit in
DNA and histones to potentially regulate other factors. In Aim 1, we will utilize in vitro binding assays to
characterize distinct binding modes of Sox2 and Oct4 to artificial and natural nucleosomes and their dependence
on DNA sequence, co-factor cooperativity, and histone composition. We will also adapt methyl TROSY NMR,
suitable for studies of super-large biomolecules, to interrogate the site-specific binding conformation and
dynamics of these proteins to select nucleosomes with atomic detail. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of Sox2
and Oct4 binding in various nucleosome positions on the conformation and accessibility of nucleosomal DNA
and the disordered histone tails by using NMR, chemical and enzymatic probing methods sensitive to structural
and dynamic perturbations. We will further assess whether Sox2 and Oct4, through direct contact and
nucleosome perturbations, stimulate the activity of histone methyltransferase enzymes that are found to
collaborate in vivo with these pioneer factors. Finally, in Aim 3, we will adapt our approach to characterize how
a methyl-DNA binding protein and proposed pioneer factor Kaiso binds to and alters nucleosomes, providing
insight into the recognition and function of epigenetic DNA marks in chromatin regulation. The proposed work
will lay the basis for future investigations of other pioneer factors and the role of DNA context, synergistic action,
histone variants and epigenetic modifications into pioneer factor-mediated chromatin opening. This will improve
our ability to modify pioneer factor function and lead to novel approaches for therapeutic targeting."

In the US and other high-income countries, immunotherapy is transforming the management of some cancers,
including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, immunotherapy is not widely available to patients in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) who might benefit the most. Our collaborations in sub-Saharan Africa over the
past 10 years have highlighted disparities for Nigerian patients diagnosed with CRC – 53% of Nigerian CRC
patients will die within a year of diagnosis, compared to 17% in the US – and incidence in Nigeria is rising.
Interestingly, in work to understand the biological underpinnings of these disparities, we found a 3-fold higher
rate of the immunogenic MSI-H (high microsatellite instability) phenotype in Nigerian compared to US CRC,
suggesting a unique opportunity to address CRC disparities in Nigeria with immunotherapy. Based on these
findings, we are separately initiating the first prospective trial of immunotherapy for MSI-H CRC in sub-Saharan
Africa. While promising, our work in this area has illuminated the severe lack of immuno-oncology data from
Nigerian patients (and other LMIC populations) at all scientific levels. Bringing the promise of immunotherapy to
these populations requires a contextual understanding of CRC immunobiology, biomarkers to efficiently and
cost-effectively select patients most likely to benefit from treatment, and regional immuno-oncology experts with
knowledge of immunotherapy and immune-related side effects. To address these needs, we will establish the
Nigerian Immuno-Oncology Research (NOLA) program, with a goal to synergize our existing strengths in global
cancer disparities research and immuno-oncology that have, until now, lacked an integrated focus and
coordination. Specifically, in this P20 project, we will unite a multi-disciplinary group to 1. develop pilot data to
guide future studies investigating the tumor microenvironment of Nigerian CRC; 2. integrate a multi-disciplinary
team and research projects focused on immuno-oncology in Nigerian and US cancer patients; and 3. develop
biobanks and databases of Nigerian CRC to support future immuno-oncology research. By the end of the project
period, we will have generated the preliminary data, resources, infrastructure, and program plan to support a
robust multi-disciplinary, collaborative immuno-oncology research to address health disparities between Nigerian
and US patients with CRC beyond the P20."

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2del) is the most com~mon human microdeletion syndrome known,
affecting some 1/4000 individuals. Most patients have a 3 Mb deletion on one copy of chromosome
22q11.2, resulting in a haploinsufficiency of over 107 genes, 46 protein coding and the remainder
noncoding RNAs and pseudogenes. Children born with this deletion can have a range of congenital
anomalies that often include three that are developmentally linked; hypoplasia of the thymus,
congenital heart defects (CHD), and hypoparathyroidism. Approximately 60-70% of the patients have
an immunodeficiency due to reduced T cell output from a hypoplastic thymus and are often clinically
referred to as having DiGeorge syndrome. The underlying mechanisms causing the defective
formation/patterning of the thymic tissue remains poorly understood. Our results, obtained during the
previous cycle of this grant, suggest a defect among the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells,
which form the thymic capsule and vasculature and regulate the expansion of the thymus. In our first
aim, the developmental abnormalities of the pharyngeal apparatus leading to the formation of a
hypoplastic thymus will be determined. Specifically, the role of the neural crest-derived mesenchymal
cells in regulating the development and expansion of the thymus will be studied. Embryonic thymii
from mouse models of 22q11.2del will be used in reaggregate fetal thymic organ cultures to define the
role of mesenchymal cells in the process of thymus expansion. RNA sequencing approaches,
including single cell RNA sequencing will be used to determine what mesenchymal transcripts are
involved in this process. These experiments will be complemented with a characterization of human
thymii from 22q11.2del patients and normal controls. In humans with 22q11.2del along with the
mouse models, there is a post-natal miRNA dysregulation noted. In aim 2, we will explore the
consequence of these miRNA changes using a combination of longitudinal studies in humans and
diverse mouse models. This will reveal whether the dysregulation of miRNAs impacts immune
functions pertaining to the thymus. Results from the two aims will enable us to develop better
strategies for restoring thymus functions in various clinical settings resulting in the hypoplasia of this
tissue."
10883732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mechanical stimuli promote bone growth and are critical for skeletal homeostasis during adulthood. Loss of
mechanical signals decreases bone mass and increases fracture risk. Osteocytes, which are cells buried in the
bone matrix and derived from osteoblasts, are able to sense changes in mechanical load and orchestrate bone
remodeling. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium channels are involved in the sensing of mechanical
load by osteocytes. For example, calcium influx is one of the earliest responses of osteocytes to mechanical
stimuli in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with a functional role for calcium signaling in the response to mechanical
forces, the response of osteocytes to mechanical stimuli can be inhibited by blocking calcium channels using
chemical blockers. Moreover, load-induced bone formation in the rat ulna is significantly blunted by calcium
channel inhibitors. However, the identity of the calcium channels activated by mechanical forces and their
functional role as mechanosensors in bone remain unclear. We have found that Piezo1 calcium channel is
highly expressed in osteocytes, and that its expression and activity are increased by mechanical stimulation in
osteocytes. In addition, deletion of Piezo1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes decreases both bone mass and bone
strength in mice, consistent with loss of skeletal responsiveness to mechanical stimulation. Moreover, the
skeletal response to anabolic loading is blunted in mice lacking Piezo1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Wnt1, a
ligand for Wnt signaling that is known to be upregulated by mechanical signals and stimulate bone formation, is
downregulated in Piezo1 conditional knockout mice. Importantly, activation of Piezo1 by its chemical agonist,
Yoda1, mimics the effects of fluid flow on osteocytes and increases bone mass in mice. Based on this
evidence, we hypothesize that osteocytes sense changes in mechanical signals through Piezo1 and thereby
promote bone formation in part by activating signaling pathways that increase the expression of Wnt1. To test
this hypothesis, we will determine whether Piezo1 expression by osteocytes is required for mechanical sensing
in the murine skeleton. We will generate mice in which Piezo1 is deleted from osteocytes, but not osteoblasts,
and compare their skeletal phenotype to that observed in mice lacking Piezo1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes.
We also will delete Piezo1 postnatally in adult mice and investigate their response to mechanical loads by tibia
compression (Aim 1). In addition, to understand how Piezo1 promotes bone formation, we will determine the
role of Wnt1 in Piezo1-mediated bone formation in vivo using a mouse genetic approach (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we
will determine whether Piezo1 is responsible for the skeletal response to unloading using a tail-suspension
model. Lastly, we will determine whether pharmacological activation of Piezo1 prevents bone loss associated
with unloading or increases bone mass in old mice. Successful completion of this work should establish a new
model for understanding the skeletal response to anabolic mechanical loading and may suggest new strategies
to develop anabolic therapies for bone loss related to disuse or aging."

pathogens that cause devastating infections that are difficult to treat, with limited drug treatment options, and
requiring surgical debridement in some patients. Over the past decade, we and others have advanced genomics,
genetics, and animal models for this understudied group of microbial pathogens. We discovered the protein
phosphatase calcineurin controls the dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphae required for Mucor pathogenesis,
and through studies of FK506-resistant isolates discovered a novel mechanism of antimicrobial drug resistance.
 In previously published and preliminary studies, significant advances were achieved through our discovery
of a novel mechanism of antifungal drug resistance called epimutation, whereby the RNAi pathway is activated
and silences drug target genes. This pathway confers transient, unstable drug resistance, and resistant isolates
rapidly revert to drug sensitivity in the absence of drug. Through genetic and molecular studies, we defined
RNAi components required for epimutation, those that are dispensable for epimutation, and a novel category
that inhibits formation of epimutations. The discovery of antimicrobial drug resistance mediated via epimutations
has been generalized: 1) showing epimutation occurs in two different pathogenic Mucor species, 2) defining an
alternative RNAi pathway controlling epimutation frequency and stability, 3) identifying epimutations in additional
genes causing resistance to antifungal agents, and 4) documenting that epimutations persist during animal
infection or arise after animal passage. These insights set the stage for studies proposed here to further define
mechanisms of epimutation, and elucidate the impact of epimutations on microbial pathogen interactions with
the host. In the current proposal, we hypothesize epimutation is a general process that operates across many
eukaryotic microbial pathogens, and acts as a major force in antimicrobial drug resistance that controls target
genes involved in drug action, genome stability, and pathogenesis of eukaryotic microbial pathogens.
 Our studies will reveal unique facets of RNAi that lead to epimutations, which mediate antimicrobial drug
resistance in ubiquitous fungal pathogens of humans. Aim 1 will 1) elucidate molecular mechanisms of
epimutation and targets, including genes involved in drug resistance (including clinically used antifungal drugs)
and transposable elements, and their impact on genome stability, 2) define conditions, including stress, sexual
reproduction, and infection, that may drive the emergence of epimutations, and 3) establish the generalizability
of these findings to other pathogenic fungal species. Aim 2 will define the impact of epimutation on antimicrobial
drug resistance and pathogenicity in microbe interactions with immune cells, the blood-brain barrier, organoids,
and whole-animal models. These studies will advance our understanding of how antimicrobial drug resistance
can evolve via a novel RNAi-based pathway with direct implications for infectious disease evolution, treatment,
and prevention, and provide insights into other eukaryotic pathogens with active RNAi pathways."

Cryptococcus neoformans and its sibling species C. gattii cause Cryptococcosis, a deadly fungal disease that
accounts for over 15% of HIV/AIDS related deaths. Treatment options for cryptococcosis remain limited to two
drug classes that are either highly toxic (polyenes) or exert a fungistatic effect (triazoles) that necessitate long
treatment regimens and can induce drug resistance. The third antifungal drug class, echinocandins, shows low
toxicity and is fungicidal against some prevalent fungal pathogens. However, Cryptococcus species are resistant
to echinocandins through an unknown resistance mechanism. We found that loss of Cdc50, the regulatory
subunit of lipid flippase, an enzyme that maintains asymmetry of the membrane lipid bilayers and regulates
intracellular vesicle trafficking, sensitizes C. neoformans to the echinocandin drug caspofungin and several
triazoles. We further showed that the cdc50∆ mutant abolishes lipid flippase activity. We also found that this
Cdc50-mediated echinocandin resistance requires a mechanosensitive calcium channel protein, Crm1, which
modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. Strikingly, we discovered that lipid flippase function is essential for
virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis, suggesting that lipid flippase may be a novel antifungal drug
target. In this project, our goals are to determine how lipid flippase mediates cryptococcal echinocandin
resistance, and to conduct proof-of-principle studies of antibody-based inhibitors targeting flippase function as
novel therapeutics for Cryptococcus infections. We hypothesize that C. neoformans has a unique plasma
membrane structure and that loss of lipid flippase alters that structure to promote the interaction of caspofungin
with its target and compromises fungal drug resistance mechanisms. We propose three Aims to test our
hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how loss of Cdc50 changes membrane structure to promote the
interaction of caspofungin with its membrane target β-1,3-D-glucan synthase (Fks1). Aim 2 will identify the
downstream drug resistance pathways that are compromised by the absence of Cdc50, which disrupts
intracellular calcium homeostasis and promotes cell death. In Aim 3, we will develop an antibody Fab fragment
and a stable peptide against the exoplasmic loop of Cdc50, which is essential for flippase function. We will
validate how inhibitors sensitize C. neoformans to antifungal drugs and macrophage killing in vitro and in vivo in
animal models. The region of Cdc50 targeted by this antibody-based approach has low sequence homology to
its human counterpart, and our preliminary studies showed that an antibody raised against this region is fungal-
specific, reducing the chance of off-target effects. The impact of this study to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying lipid flippase mediated drug resistance in C. neoformans will be developing strategies for exploiting
echinocandin drugs to effectively treat Cryptococci and other resistant fungal pathogens. Our successful
development of antibody-based inhibitors will establish a new avenue of research and drug development against
other membrane proteins in fungi and bacteria."

Defects in protein translation are central to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (e.g., frontotemporal lobar dementia). An unconventional form of translation has been
shown to play a role in several neurodegenerative diseases associated with nucleotide repeat diseases. In
these diseases, expanded nucleotide repeats get translated in an AUG-independent manner to produce
aberrant peptides that may contribute to neurodegeneration. The mechanism of this unusual form of
translation, called RAN translation, has remained poorly understood. The Gitler and Puglisi laboratories have
joined forces to combine biophysics and genetics approaches to elucidate the mechanism of RAN translation.
We developed new single-molecule methodologies to study translation dynamics in humans and combined
these with biochemical and in vivo approaches to reveal a global mechanism for RAN translation and identified
potent modifiers of RAN translation, at least one of which could mitigate degeneration in several frontotemporal
dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease models. We propose new studies to gain even
deeper understanding of RAN translation. We will also expand and extend our efforts to investigate a new facet
of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) pathology that we recently discovered – altered processing of the 3’ end of
certain mRNAs, which are targets of the FTD and ALS disease protein TDP-43. These altered 3’ ends of the
mRNAs has profound effects on the translation of the mRNAs and we have evidence that at least one of them
is directly linked to FTD. Our results will build on the foundation of the prior funding period and establish a
coherent dynamic mechanism of RAN translation and its regulation from initiation through protein production.
We will also illuminate a new facet of TDP-43 pathology in FTD and ALS and how this impacts protein
translation. More broadly, our results will provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding the interplay of
translation dynamics and fidelity and protein quality control in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including
dementia."

In this R01 Renewal project, we will examine contribution of the EphB2 receptor-NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
interaction to excitatory synaptic neurotransmission in dorsal horn (DH) pain circuitry and neuropathic pain (NP)
after spinal cord injury (SCI). NP is a highly debilitating and often chronic outcome that occurs in a major portion
of SCI cases. Importantly, this NP is particularly refractory to treatment, urgently calling for identification of targets
that both robustly regulate pathological pain and avoid the devastating effects of opioid-based interventions.
 NMDAR-mediated hyperexcitability of DH circuitry is a major substrate for pathological pain. NP has been
linked to EphB receptor tyrosine kinases via potentiation of NMDAR function, as EphB signaling regulates
multiple facets of NMDAR biology, including NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx and synaptic plasticity. We
discovered that EphB2 modulation of NMDARs is mediated by a direct, extracellular interaction between EphB2
and the NMDAR. Importantly, we elucidated the mechanism regulating this interaction: phosphorylation of a
single extracellular amino acid of EphB2 (Y504) interacts with a positive surface charge on the N-terminal domain
of the NMDAR GluN1 subunit. We find in vitro that Y504 phosphorylation is required in spinal cord neurons for
EphB2-NMDAR interaction, NMDAR synaptic localization, and excitatory synapse function. In our cervical
contusion SCI model that results in forepaw hyperalgesia and allodynia, and ongoing pain, this NP phenotype is
accompanied by long-lasting increases in EphB2 expression and signaling, Y504 phosphorylation, and EphB2-
NMDAR co-localization at excitatory synapses in cervical DH, in particular in the highly-important population of
DH pain projection neurons. Excitingly, inducible DH neuron-specific EphB2 knockout or inducible chemogenetic
inhibition of EphB tyrosine kinase signaling robustly reverses already-established NP-related behavior after SCI.
 We therefore hypothesize that modulating EphB2-NMDAR interaction in DH pain projection neurons after
cervical contusion SCI will impact: (1) NMDAR synaptic localization, (2) excitatory synaptic transmission in DH
pain circuitry, and (3) NP. In Aim 1, we will determine whether inducible EphB2 knockout selectively in DH
projection neurons reduces NMDAR synaptic localization and NP-related behaviors using a novel floxed-EphB2
mouse. In Aim 2, we will determine if preventing EphB2-NMDAR interaction selectively in DH projection neurons
impacts NMDAR synaptic localization, excitatory synaptic transmission and NP behaviors using our innovative
knockin mouse that allows for inducible expression of EphB2-Y504F (EphB2 with single amino acid switch that
blocks interaction with the NMDAR). In Aim 3, we will determine the role of EphB2 intracellular tyrosine kinase
activity in NP using a chemogenetic mouse that allows for specific, inducible and reversible inhibition of EphB2
kinase function; these studies will explore the NP therapeutic implications of targeting EphB2 kinase signaling.
 This highly innovative project will elucidate how an unexplored form of excitatory synaptic regulation –
EphB2-NMDAR interaction mediated by extracellular EphB2 phosphorylation – contributes to NP following SCI."
10882576,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In 2018, heart allocation moved from using three statuses to six statuses, but the priority groups remain
undifferentiated and large, only coarsely reflecting each candidate’s risk of death on the waiting list. The new
system aimed to reduce exception requests and more accurately rank candidates; instead, exceptions, which
might be subjectively or inappropriately assigned, have risen to comprise 30% of heart transplants. The system
also incentivized dramatic changes in clinical practice: because intraortic balloon pumps yield higher priority for
transplant, balloon pump usage increased three-fold even though balloon pumps are associated with increased
risk of neurologic complications. Other disparities persist: sensitized candidates wait four times as long for
transplants but get no increased priority for hearts, in contrast to increased kidney priority for sensitized
candidates. Our study will first describe the landscape of disparities in heart transplant, diagnosing whether
transplants are equally available to candidates who are sensitized, of smaller or larger size, and of different
races and ethnicities. We will also determine whether exception statuses are justified by candidates’ individual
risks of waitlist death, and whether exceptions are being requested and granted in an equitable fashion. We
will use machine learning to build a MESH (Model for End State Heart disease) score that predicts death on
the waitlist for heart transplant candidates from national data. An individualized MESH score based on
hemodynamic criteria in the context of cardiac pathology, end organ function, cause of heart failure, and
eligibility for mechanical circulatory support therapies would better prioritize heart transplant candidates to
reduce waitlist deaths without distorting clinical practice. Implementing an analogous lung allocation score in
2005 reduced waitlist deaths from 500 to 300 per year, so this change is overdue in heart allocation. Finally,
we will design a composite allocation score for hearts. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
has resolved to replace the 250 and 500 mile circles in current policy with continuous distribution by
implementing a composite allocation score. A composite allocation score is a weighted combination of medical
urgency (MESH), with distance between donor and candidate, and other priority considerations like blood type,
candidate and donor size, sensitization, and priority for prior living donors. However, eliminating geographic
boundaries in this way creates an enormous combinatorial design space with complex tradeoffs. We will use
simulation optimization to explore many possible choices for the numerical weights using clinically detailed
simulations, guided by a differential evolution algorithm. Our team is exceptionally well-suited to the task, with
dedicated quantitative scientists who have years of collaborative experience advancing transplantation
partnering with clinicians of a superior heart transplant program. The proposed research would correct an
arbitrary and coarse prioritization scheme, by establishing a validated heart allocation scoring system that
reduces waitlist deaths and increases equity in heart allocation."

We here focus on determining the algorithms that enable highly similar visual information to be transformed into
diverse, behaviorally relevant outputs. We also seek to determine the mechanisms that generate these
algorithms. Understanding how visual information is transformed into representations relevant for behavior is
key for restoring sensorimotor transformations in those who are blind or visually impaired, or suffer from sensory
processing disorders. For our visual inputs, we use looming stimuli, the 2-D projections of an object approaching
on a direct collision course. Looming stimuli elicit a conserved diversity in behavioral responses across species
that are necessary for survival. This diversity is thought to emerge through parallel sensorimotor processing
pathways that differentially transform visual features of a looming stimulus into motor outputs. Limited access
to both visual feature encoding and visual feature integrating circuit components has however limited the
development and biological validation of the algorithms utilized across pathways. We circumvent these
limitations by using Drosophila melanogaster that provides the necessary electrophysiological and genetic
access to the cell types that participate in these sensorimotor transformations. Our preliminary data suggest
looming information is transformed within eight descending sensorimotor pathways (DN) that receive features of
looming stimuli from up to six optic lobe columnar projection neuron (OLCPN) cell types. In this interdisciplinary
grant, we capitalize on the complementary expertise of Dr. von Reyn (PI), who has pioneered
electrophysiological, behavioral, and genetic methods for investigating feature integration within OLCPN and
DN, and Dr. Ausborn (co-PI), who has broad expertise in the development of mechanistic biophysical circuit
models for the analysis of neural computations within mammalian and invertebrate systems. Here we
characterize the extent to which different DN intrinsic properties and circuit mechanisms account for the observed
output diversity. In Aim 1 we combine electrophysiology, RNAi silencing, and computational modeling to
establish, at a molecular level, intrinsic integration mechanisms for each DN. In Aim 2, we combine
electrophysiology, optogenetics, and computational modeling to determine OLCPN synaptic inputs to DN. In Aim
3, through concurrent model and experimental probing, we evaluate the dominant mechanisms that determine
looming feature integration algorithms utilized across the DN population. This project will provide a thorough
understanding of general principles for transforming sensory information into higher order, behaviorally relevant

The initial adaptive immune response to tumors and many viruses relies on the priming of CD8 T cells to gen-
erate cytolytic effector T cells that can specifically target tumors or virally infected cells. The priming of CD8 T
cells to these agents is carried out in vivo by a particular type of antigen presenting cell that is a component of
the myeloid system and a member of the family of dendritic cells. Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) comprise
several closely related lineages that are clearly distinct from other myeloid cells such as macrophages, mono-
cytes or granulocytes. Primarily, cDCs serve to activate T cells against infections in the central lymphoid tis-
sues, rather than carrying out direct effector functions at sites of infections as the other myeloid lineages do.
The cDCs are themselves comprised of at least two major branches, now called cDC1 and cDC2. The cDC1
is a lineage that specializes in the uptake and processing of cell-associated antigens, such as from tumors of
virally infected cells and the expression of peptide epitopes on its cell surface in conjunction with MHC-I mole-
cules. This form of antigen:MHC-I complex is able to activate CD8 T cells, and not CD4 T cells. This process is
called cross-presentation. The cDC2 is not capable of carrying out cross-presentation to viruses or tumors in
vivo. The cDC1 has many genetic and molecular differences from cDC2; cDC1 require a distinct set of tran-
scription factors for their development that are not required for cDC2. This includes dependence on the tran-
scription factors Nfil3, Id2, Irf8 and Batf3. Our recent work showed that the genetic hierarchy among these fac-
tors has Nfil3 as the first and initiating factor, acting to indirectly induce Id2 and Batf3 via the suppression of the
repressor Zeb2. However, it is still unknown how Nfil3 is induced to initiate this process, and how Nfil3 works to
suppress Zeb2 expression. It has recently become important to understand these details because of the clini-
cal interest to apply Flt3L administration as a therapeutic in expanding the in vivo population of cDC1. It has
been known for some time that Fl3L can expand dendritic cells in general and expand cDC1 in particular. But
we have uncovered a surprising and worrisome fact; Flt3L administration will expand cDC1-like cells even in
Nfil3-deficient mice, which completely lack cDC1 beforehand. The expansion of cDC1 in Nfil3-deficent mice
produced by Flt3L is of the same magnitude as the expansion in WT mice. Thus, Flt3L is inducing cDC1 by a
different genetic route than normal cDC1 development. There has been no test of whether such cDC1 cells
function normally and will boost an immune response. This application will systematically address this issue by
Aim 1) defining the normal process by which Nfil3 is induced, Aim 2) define the mechanism by which NFIL3
drives cDC1 development, and Aim 3) determine whether Flt3-induced cDC1 function normally and determine
the mechanism by which Flt3L bypasses the normal requirement for Nfil3 in cDC1 development."

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and the primary cellular
targets of diabetes in the retina have not been fully elucidated. This represents a significant barrier to the
development of effective therapies to prevent or slow down the initiation of the disease. When challenged by
diabetes, retinal neurons, glia, and the vasculature all display abnormalities. Even though it is currently not
clear which cell types are the primary targets of diabetes, Müller glial cells (MG), as one of the first responders
of diabetes in the retina, are essential for the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, the molecular
mechanisms controlling the diabetes-induced Müller glial responses remain understudied.
 We applied single cell transcriptomic analysis (single cell RNA-seq) to systematically profile diabetes-
induced multicellular responses in the retina of diabetic rat models (preliminary studies). Among the 53 types of
retinal cell detected by single cell RNA-seq, MG were one of the first responders to diabetes at the
transcriptional level. Notably, MG initially upregulated genes that play protective roles in other systems,
including anti-apoptosis, anti-proliferation, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation genes, but failed to maintain
expression levels of these protective genes as the disease progressed. This failure could contribute to the
development of DR. We hypothesize that MG exert protective roles by upregulating protective genes in the
early stage of DR, and that enhancing this intrinsic protective mechanism will protect the retina from diabetes-
induced damage.
 The proposed studies will test this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, we will focus on studying one of the
candidate protective genes, Zinc finger protein 36 homolog (Zfp36), which was initially upregulated by diabetes
in MG and then downregulated as DR progressed, using diabetic rat models. In Aim 2, we will determine
whether multiplexing activation of protective pathways in MG with a novel CRISPR-based technique can
further protect the retina from diabetes-induced damage.
 In summary, the proposed study aims to uncover the roles of MG in initiating DR, focusing on dissecting
their protective effects. This work will lead to better understanding of DR and new therapeutic candidates."
10873957,"Structural variants (SV) are a major driver of the genetic diversity and disease in the human genome and their
discovery is imperative to advances in precision medicine and our understanding of human genetics. Due to
revolutionary breakthroughs in whole-genome sequencing technologies, we now have access to genomic data at an
unprecedented scale and resolution. However, despite tremendous effort and progress in SV calling methodology,
general SV discovery still remains unsolved. Existing techniques use hand-engineered features and heuristics to
model SV classes, relying heavily on developer expertise, which cannot scale to the vast diversity of SV types and
sequencing platforms nor fully harness all the information available in raw sequencing data. As a result, these
methods are usually tightly coupled to the properties of a particular sequencing technology and operate optimally
only on certain SV types and sizes, rendering us blind to many other classes of SVs and their role in disease. Deep
neural networks have the ability to learn complex abstractions automatically from the data and hence offer a
promising avenue for general SV discovery. Deep learning has recently transformed the field of machine learning
and led to remarkable advances in science and medicine. In this proposal we aim to leverage the potential of deep
learning for the problem of SV detection. We lay out how to efficiently formulate SV detection as a deep learning
task, and propose the development of a comprehensive framework to call and genotype SVs of different size and
type, including complex and subclonal SVs, given data from a range of sequencing platforms. In particular, we
demonstrate that state-of-the-art results can be obtained using our approach for short, linked, and long read

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous species-specific betaherpesvirus that results in life-long persistent
asymptomatic infection in an immunocompetent host. Human CMV (HCMV) is the most common infectious
cause of congenital infection, complicating 40,000 births in the U.S. annually. In utero CMV transmission occurs
in 33-50% of pregnant CMV-seronegative women with primary infection; it also occurs after non-primary
infection in pregnant CMV-seropositive women so that regions of high CMV seroprevalence account for a major
part of the global burden of congenital CMV. Studies in mice and humans have shown that CMV has profound
effects on both the innate and adaptive immune system. However, there is a gap in knowledge of when CMV
imprints the immune system and whether maternal CMV infection during pregnancy can affect fetal
development and immunity even in the absence of CMV transmission. In this grant, our aim is to study the effect
of maternal exposure to CMV infection on fetal immunity using a biologically relevant rhesus macaque
nonhuman primate (NHP) animal model of HCMV. We hypothesize that maternal exposure to CMV infection
during pregnancy induces perturbation of cellular metabolism that adversely affect immune cell populations
utilizing common metabolic pathways, leading to (i) hitherto unrecognized impact of CMV-mediated metabolic
dysregulation on innate and adaptive immunity at the maternal-fetal interface, and (ii) epigenetic modifications
and functional effects on fetal T and B lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. We will utilize a combined
approach of cellular immunology assays, transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate the effect of CMV
infection on placental immunometabolism and fetal immunity in the NHP model. Our specific aims are: #1. To
investigate the effect of chronic maternal CMV infection on placental immunometabolism and fetal immunity;
and #2. To determine the effect of experimental primary CMV infection during pregnancy on placental
immunometabolism and fetal immunity."

ensure compliance of all clinical trials with all regulatory agencies. The BID core will then support investigators
identified via this national competition to implement identified innovative clinical trials which align with the
themes of the Northwell Roybal Center in Years 3 through 5 of the proposed project. The BID Core will also
support the conduct of two Stage II fully-powered clinical trials in Years 1 and 2 which aim to foster habitual
physical among caregivers for persons with AD/ADRD. Trial #1 will work to develop habitual daily walking
among caregivers while Trial #2 will work to develop habitual hourly walking as a means of reducing the
amount of time caregivers spend sedentary. Both trials will measure the key mechanism of behavior (MoBC) of
cognitive automaticity.
The overall mission of the Northwell Roybal Center for Personalized Trials is to establish an infrastructure
organized per the NIH Stage Model with scientiﬁc expertise and resources to conduct Stages 0-V trials of the

Young adulthood (ages 18-25) is a critical developmental period during which individuals often escalate or
mature out of substance use. Indeed, young adults (YA) use cannabis at the highest rate of any age group, with
35% reporting past year use, thus it is critical to identify factors associated with hazardous cannabis use given
the potential impact on this vulnerable developmental group. Heavy cannabis use among YA is related to poorer
health later in life, deleterious long-term effects on cognition, engagement in hazardous behaviors while under
the influence (e.g., driving), and myriad other cannabis-related problems. As such, it is imperative to understand
factors that influence the time course of cannabis use patterns and mechanisms underlying transition from casual
to heavy or hazardous use levels. Notably, young adulthood is characterized by frequent, smaller-scale
transitions (i.e., micro-transitions) and critical life events that can lead to an escalation or reduction in cannabis
use, likely depending on their subjective evaluation (i.e., valence). Certain transitions may increase cannabis
use frequency (e.g., college entrance), while others may be protective (e.g., marriage). A behavioral economic
(BE) framework can help explain how micro-transitions during young adulthood influence prospective changes
in cannabis use. BE domains are influenced by internal (e.g., craving) and external (e.g., new employment)
influences and include (1) access to and preference for alternative reinforcers (i.e., lack of alternative activities
that compete with cannabis), (2) discounting of delayed rewards (i.e., inordinate preference for smaller
immediate rewards, such as positive cannabis effects), and (3) relative cannabis value (i.e., demand; willingness
to pay prohibitively high prices for cannabis despite limited resources or income). Further, motives for cannabis
use (e.g., coping, enhancement) are key variables that likely account for the relation between micro-transitions
and changes in cannabis use among YA as well. Investigating factors that relate to escalation or reduction in
cannabis use are of clear"

During brain development, the assembly of functional neural circuits necessitates sophisticated regulation of
neural arborization patterns. This mechanism is achieved by a process known as neural self-avoidance, which
allows projections from the same neuron to recognize and avoid self. In mammals, the regulation of neural self-
avoidance relies on the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein
isoforms in individual neurons. Neural-type-specific Pcdh expression is provided by a remarkable and complex
mechanism of promoter selection, wherein individual neurons can choose which and how many of the 120 Pcdh
isoforms (60 on each of the two parental chromosomes) to express and thereby acquire specific instructions for
their connectivity patterns. For instance, convergence of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) projections requires
random expression of distinct Pcdh isoforms in individual cells, while tiling of neural arbors of serotonergic
neurons (5-HTs) requires expression of the same isoform. Despite the fundamental role that Pcdh genes play in
sculpting neural circuits and their implication in several devastating neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders,
the molecular strategy by which individual neurons express unique combinations of Pcdh genes remains a
mystery. Here we propose to investigate the mechanism of Pcdh gene choice in vivo using mouse olfactory
sensory neurons and their progenitor cells by the cohesin protein complex and its regulator WAPL. The proposed
studies rest on published and unpublished preliminary data that implicate cohesin in shaping the three-

mechanisms of circuit assembly for olfactory sensory neurons, but they will also provide an unprecedented view
of neural patterning across scales, linking cell-type-specific regulation of cohesin to neural wiring during brain

architecture governs gene expression more broadly."
10881362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Congenital disorders of glycosylation are multi-system inherited diseases, which affect the amount of
glycosylation added to proteins. For patients with mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) deficiency, decreased
mannose production leads to globally decreased levels of N-linked glycans resulting in several issues with
congenital diarrhea and protein losing enteropathy being the most significant symptoms. Our long-term
objective is to determine how defective glycosylation manifests as disease. We aim to achieve this objective
using a novel mouse strain named benadryl, which has an Mpi mutation and models most of the features of
human disease. We found conditional knockout of Mpi in the intestines re-created cardinal features of the
benadryl strain with severe defects in the mucus producing goblet cells, and features of inflammatory bowel
disease. The goal of this project is to determine how Mpi protects the intestines and how to improve therapeutic
interventions for patients deficient in Mpi. The central hypothesis is that Mpi is a rate limiting step for N-
glycosylation of mucins like Muc2, which are essential for proper mucin maturation and barrier function. In this
proposal we will investigate (Aim 1) how N-glycosylation of Muc2 is required for goblet cell survival, intestinal
mucus production, and protection from bacteria; (Aim 2) how N-glycosylation sites are essential for proper Muc2
folding and dimerization; and (Aim 3) the mechanism for how mannose therapy protects gastrointestinal barriers.
Upon finishing these studies, we will have defined the role of N-glycosylation post-translation modification of
Muc2 in maintaining a proper intestinal mucus barrier to prevent bacterial invasion and inflammation. Further,
we will leverage N-glycosylation insights to test feasibility and mechanism of mannose as a therapy in pre-clinical
models of gastrointestinal disease."
10886161,"SUMMARY: Treatment patterns for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at the US
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have changed substantially in the past few years. VHA patients with
mCRPC are still treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonists initially. Nevertheless, a recent publication demonstrated that currently, 77% VHA mCRPC
patients who progress on ADT are being further treated with 2nd generation anti-androgens: the CYP17A1
inhibitor abiraterone (ABI) with prednisone or the androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor enzalutamide (ENZA), while
23% are treated with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel. A post hoc analysis reported that docetaxel was the
most common and effective first subsequent therapy (FST) among patients who progressed following protocol-
specified treatment with ABI. However, the median docetaxel treatment duration among these patients was 4.2
months; hence, our goal is to find ways to prolong the efficacy of docetaxel in post-ABI VHA mCRPC patients.
Multiple studies have pointed to a role for Galectin-1 (Gal-1) in tumor formation and aggressiveness in
docetaxel resistant CRPC. We demonstrate that Gal-1 was elevated in CRPC, while inhibition of Gal-1
inhibited cell growth, invasion and migration. Based on these observations, we have now developed a novel
Gal-1 inhibitor, LLS30, which is benzimidazole-based, and is therefore less toxic and of superior efficacy
compared to conventional and existing Gal-1 inhibitors. LLS30 demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects in
Gal-1 expressing, but not Gal-1 low, CRPC cell lines, and disrupted cell adhesion in high Gal1 cells. LLS30
also sensitized ABI-resistant cell lines to docetaxel in models of mCRPC that expressed high Gal-1.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that ABI/ENZA treatment promotes Gal-1 expression, and Gal-1
nuclear translocation, where it induces the formation of AR splice variants that induce resistance to ABI/ENZA.
We propose that Gal-1 targeting to the nuclear envelope is mediated by microtubule dynamics, which is
prevented by subsequent treatment with docetaxel; and by nuclear pore entry, which may be prevented by
LLS30. Docetaxel resistance is often traced to the expression and activation of p-glycoprotein (p-gp), which
promotes multi-drug resistance. Studies have shown that Gal-1 induces p-gp expression; hence LLS30 will
prevent docetaxel resistance by suppressing p-gp expression and also inhibit Gal-1 nuclear localization.
Aim 1: To determine the mechanism of Gal-1 involvement in docetaxel resistance and a potential role
for LLS30 in overcoming that resistance will test the hypothesis that AR activity suppresses Gal-1 expression
and/or subcellular localization, and whether nuclear Gal-1 induces resistance to ABI/ENZA by promoting
expression of AR splice variants that lack the AR-LBD. Further, we will determine whether LLS30 prevents Gal-
1 nuclear localization by inhibiting its binding to the nuclear pore complex. Cooperation between docetaxel and
LLS30 to impede progression in ABI/ENZA-resistant CRPC models by inhibiting Gal-1 nuclear translocation will
also be investigated, especially in view of a role of p-gp. Aim 2: Test the role of Gal-1 in mediating the
effects of the novel inhibitor LLS30 on the response of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of ABI-
resistant CRPC to docetaxel. PDX tumors derived from biopsy material of patients with post-ABI CRPC to
docetaxel will be used to evaluate the effects of LLS30 on the response of CRPC to docetaxel. We will examine
whether castration, LLS30 and/or docetaxel affect Gal-1 localization in the tumor, and whether translocation of
Gal-1 by LLS30 or docetaxel correlate with the expression of AR and its splice variants. Aim 3. To investigate
the relationship between serum Gal-1 levels and docetaxel treatment in patients who progress on
ABI/ENZA treatment for mCRPC at the VANCHCS. Here we will test the hypothesis that serum levels of Gal-
1 in patients with post-ABI/ENZA CRPC correlate with their subsequent response to docetaxel. Patient Criteria
and Plan. Also, we will determine whether docetaxel or treatments with ABI or ENZA affects serum gal-1 levels."
10885946,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among western women. Although adjuvant and
molecularly targeted therapies significantly improve patient survival in some molecular subtypes
of breast cancer, the prognosis of triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer (TNBC) remains grim,
due to lack of identification of oncogenic drivers. In searching of cancer vulnerability, it was
discovered that TNBC is especially dependent on glutamine metabolism, likely due to up-
regulation of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2/SLC1A5, and glutaminase, GLS, representing
the rate-limiting steps in glutamine consumption. Despite the interest in targeting glutaminolysis
in TNBC, it is unclear how global inhibition of glutamine metabolism will affect immune cells in
the tumor microenvironment, particularly given that rapidly proliferating tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) require glutaminolysis to supply macromolecules for cell growth.
Specifically, the competition between tumor cells and TILs for glutamine has not been
investigated thus far, but is likely to be important for anti-tumor immunity.
We have generated preliminary data providing evidence that knockout of GLS specifically in
tumor cells increases glutamine concentration in the tumor interstitial fluid and enhances
cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocyte activities. The above effects are abrogated in immune-deficient
mice, suggesting that adaptive immunity plays a critical role. In addition, pharmacologic
inhibition of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2, selectively targeting tumor cells while enhancing
TIL function. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that (1) tumor cells outcompete TILs for
glutamine to sustain their proliferative programs while simultaneously suppressing antitumor
immune response, and (2) selectively targeting glutamine metabolism in tumor cells enhances
antitumor immunity. To test these hypotheses, we will first test glutamine competition between
tumor cells and TILs and how this competition affects tumor growth, metastasis, and anti-tumor
immune responses (Aim 1). We will also define how metabolic changes in GLS loss specifically
in tumor cells impact T cell recruitment and activation in situ by MALDI-imaging mass
spectrometry (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate in vivo pharmacological targeting of glutamine
transporter and glutaminase for treating TNBC (Aim 3). The success of the project will elucidate
a long-standing issue whether there is a metabolic competition for glutamine between tumor
cells and infiltrating lymphocytes, and leverage the knowledge for developing new therapeutic
strategies for treatment of glutamine-addicted cancer."

About 1 in 8 women in the U.S. will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. Human
Epidermal growth factor Receptor-2 (HER2) is a clinically validated target that is upregulated in 25% of
these cancers and is associated with poor disease prognosis. Current medications targeting HERs have
several limitations because of their inadequate effectiveness and sensitivity to resistance by cancer cell
mutations, causing treatment failure. HER receptor family requires an important dimerization step for
activation that is essential for cancer cells to maintain growth and division. Inhibition of dimerization is
currently clinically achieved with antibodies that cannot target mutated truncated receptor forms and
cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, turning the brain into a sanctuary for cancer cells and leading to
metastasis and relapse.
 Our lab discovered a small molecule through virtual screening; molecular modeling algorithms
predict it will bind to the HER2 dimer interface surface, which would allosterically inhibit the receptor
activation by preventing dimerization. This molecule was shown in cellular assays to inhibit SKBr3 cancer
cell lines overexpressing HER2 in a selective and non-toxic manner. This is the first-in-class molecule to
target a member of this receptor family using an allosteric inhibition mechanism. If advanced for clinical
testing, it can work as a stand-alone therapy for patient populations that resist current medications or in
combination therapies to decrease resistance, metastasis, and relapse. The overall objective of this
proposal is to characterize and validate analogs of this inhibitor predicted by modeling to share a similar
binding pose and the same or higher affinity to the HER2 dimer interface. We will validate their
interaction with HER2 using cellular, biophysical, and biochemical assays. We will also study their effect
on cancer cells' downstream targets expression and phosphorylation levels and test the top-performing
lead compound plasma distribution properties and efficacy in HER2+ breast cancer in vivo models.
 The proposed study is innovative due to the new mechanism of inhibition proposed by modeling
and indicated by the selective toxicity shown in cellular studies. Our long-term goal is to extend this
research to related receptors in the same family (EGFR, HER3, and HER4) that are implicated in many
solid tumors, some of which lack targeted therapies. The outcomes of this study will offer proof of
concept to usher in a new class of anticancer agents targeting HER2 receptors. The project will support
research experiences in cancer drug discovery and therapeutics to six PharmD, one graduate, and six
undergraduate students in two REAP-eligible institutions."

We propose a project to reduce morbidity as related to health disparities in prostate cancer survivors by
identifying disparities in symptom burden and their contributors among African American prostate cancer
survivors. The limited research reported that patient-reported quality of life outcomes are worse in African
American compared to White prostate cancer survivors. Most importantly, other critically important symptom
burden outcomes are largely understudied and overlooked in minorities. Previous research suggests African
American prostate cancer survivors likely experience signiﬁcant symptom burden for outcomes that are
avoidable or treatable. The proposed project will address these critical public health concerns in the growing
population of African American prostate cancer survivors.!
This project aims to 1) Compare symptom burden between African American and White prostate cancer
survivors, 2) Identify multilevel modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden among both African
American and White prostate cancer survivors, such as cultural, health behavior-related, psychosocial, and
racial discrimination factors, and 3) Identify multilevel non-modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden,
such as genetic, clinical, treatment-related, and demographic factors. The risk factors we will study are
informed by an adapted multilevel contextual model examining the levels of the person, social environment,
and healthcare system.!
This will be among the ﬁrst and most comprehensive studies we are aware of to compare symptom burden
between African American and White prostate cancer survivors. It will be the ﬁrst we are aware of to identify
modiﬁable and non-modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden. These risk factor data will allow us to
develop targeted interventions and identify high-risk individuals for monitoring and early intervention. In
summary, this project's focus on identifying disparities and their risk factors supports the Healthy People 2020
goals of eliminating health disparities and improving quality of life in cancer survivors."

This K23 proposal seeks to further the career of Dr. Stefanie Russman Block through a mentored research
project and training plan that focuses on innovative neuroimaging methods and a theoretical framework of
emotion dysregulation applied to anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health
condition worldwide and disproportionately affect young adults (age 18-24). Despite the existence of
evidenced-based treatments, remission rates are low. Cognitive reappraisal (CR), a core therapeutic skill that
involves changing the meaning of a situation (e.g., threatening) to alter its emotional content (i.e., lower
anxiety), relies on the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), which continues to mature until age 25, and is
underrecruited in anxiety patients compared to healthy participants. Real-time functional magnetic
resonance imaging neurofeedback (NF), which teaches volitional control over targeted brain activity, may
offer a novel approach to engage the vlPFC during CR, thereby improving the effectiveness of emotion
regulation and reducing anxiety. In the proposed K23, young adults with elevated anxiety (N = 88) will be
randomized to NF targeted at the vlPFC or sham NF while performing the Emotion Regulation Task.
Participants will be instructed to reappraise the meaning of negative images to reduce their emotional impact
or to look at them passively. After each trial, participants are presented with a thermometer displaying neural
activity from the reappraise > look contrast. The sham group views pseudo-random feedback, generated to
match the spectral characteristics and average success rate of veritable feedback. After each run, participants
rate their negative affect on a visual analog scale. The specific research aims are to: 1) Evaluate the ability of
young adults with anxiety to increase vlPFC activity during CR based on NF by comparing the increase in
neural activity pre to post training; 2) Determine the relationship between vlPFC recruitment and CR
success using the reduction in negative affective ratings compared to passive viewing pre to post training; and
3) Assess the impact of NF on anxiety symptoms over time (exploratory). This K23 project will help define
a treatment target and provide pilot data for a future R-level grant. The following training objectives will ensure
that Dr. Russman Block successfully achieves these aims and is equipped to become an independent
researcher: 1) acquire skills in the design, implementation, and analysis of NF research; 2) gain
expertise in the affective neuroscience of emotion regulation; and 3) obtain training in experimental
therapeutics, including the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials. These training
objectives will provide the necessary foundation for her long-term career goals of becoming an independent,
extramurally-funded, clinical-translational researcher, whose research will seek to understand neural
processes involved in psychotherapeutic interventions and to develop novel neuroscience-based treatments
for anxiety-related conditions. The proposed K23 is an essential first step in fulfilling these career goals."

a well-equipped and diverse workforce that meets future challenges in cancer research. Programs span career
stages from high school students to junior faculty. Training is cross-disciplinary and includes dedicated
programs for oncology nursing, pharmacy, genetic counselors, as well as science educators in the catchment
area. CRTEC's portfolio includes seven NCI-funded T32 training grants; six additional T32 training grants are
led by SKCCC members and have a significant cancer focus. These programs support pre- and post-graduate
trainees in cancer epidemiology, nanotechnology, molecular medicine, and immunology among others. Several
are dedicated to training physician-scientists including medical, pediatric, and surgical oncologists. Cancer
relevant peer reviewed funding is $10.1M with $5.1M from the NCI. CRTEC benefits from strong institutional
support with a $2.8M annual budget that supplements training grants, facilitates CME activities, and supports
new training programs. Since Dr. Mary Armanios was recruited as Associate Director for CRTEC in 2019, she
founded and leads the Office of CRTEC. Dr. Armanios has refined governance to include new working
committees with oversight from a Steering Committee. An Internal Advisory Board provides bi-directional

nationally. Workshops addressing anti-racism and cutting-edge technologies have been introduced and
CRTEC serves as a single point of contact for making these opportunities available to JHU faculty, staff and
trainees. CRTEC has leveraged existing JHU programs to create new oncology threads for undergraduate and
post-baccalaureate students; these have 40-70% matriculation rates into graduate and medical school. A
research program for medical students from underprivileged universities has 37% minority representation and
27% of students have entered oncology careers. A new grant writing curriculum supports trainees and junior
faculty through workshops, internal review, and a Grant Club; these efforts have led to 50%-80% funding rates
in the first two years. CRTEC implements programs to support women and minorities including recently to
mitigate the pandemic's effects on workforce diversity. During the next period, CRTEC will use existing

reagents including high quality antibodies and expression constructs. This has been particularly challenging for
PKD because polycystins in particular are multi-domain membrane proteins that are difficult to work with. Many
of the available antibodies lack sufficient affinity and specificity and large cDNA constructs are difficult to
manipulate in cloning applications. The overarching goal of the Antibody and Vector Core is not only to supply
investigators with our existing reagents, but to apply recent advances in biotechnology to develop the most
innovative tools that will advance the next generation of discoveries in PKD research. This application builds on
the Principal Investigator’s decades long experience in the study of polycystin biochemistry that will allow him to
provide technical expertise so that investigators can fully leverage these novel reagents. In order to accomplish
this goal we propose the following specific aims: 1) Maintain and provide validated PKD antibody kits that detect
full length endogenous proteins 2) Use a novel strategy of whole cell immunization with cell surface PC1/PC2 to
develop mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the polycystin complex in its native configuration 3)
Develop the first PC1 and PC2 Camelid VHH nanobodies using purified and stabilized PC1/PC2 complex antigen
4) Develop the first PC2 VHH nanobodies using purified and functional PC2-tetramer embedded in lipid
nanodiscs and 5) Provide and develop easy-to-use vectors for PKD gene expression, inactivation and
manipulation. In summary the Antibody and Vector Core will provide the research community with a
comprehensive array of validated reagents and unique expertise that will facilitate discoveries in the PKD field."

 The goal of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center Hematologic Malignancies and Bone
Marrow Transplantation Program is to improve the understanding and treatment of hematologic malignancies
and related disorders. The Program is focused on three scientific aims that cross disease boundaries and
bridge laboratory and clinical efforts: (1) targeting genetic and epigenetic alterations in hematologic
malignancies, (2) studying normal and neoplastic lymphohematopoiesis, and (3) improving bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) outcomes. These thematic investigations extend from basic observations in the
laboratory to clinical trials and from clinical observations back to laboratory investigation. Led by Richard F.
Ambinder, M.D., Ph.D., and Richard J. Jones, M.D., the Program consists of 29 Program full Members, 15 of
whom have peer-reviewed funding, and an additional eleven Associate Members, including six with active K
awards during this last funding period. The Program has members with appointments in five departments
across two schools at Johns Hopkins. The total direct cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding is $4.4 million,
with $1.7 million from the National Cancer Institute, with two new investigators having received their first R01s
in the last year. The total number of publications by Program members since last review is 508, of which 148
(29.1%) are Intra-Programmatic, 91 (17.9%) are Inter-Programmatic and 325 (64.0%) have external
collaborations. Of these publications, 25% are in journals with impact factors >10 and 5.3% in journals with
impact factors >25. Since the last review, the Program has continued to be an international leader in the
development of novel new treatments for hematologic malignancies and related disorders. In additional to
overseeing the interdisciplinary/thematic focus of the faculty members in the Program, Program leadership is
also responsible for prioritizing resources and ensuring that interactions are synergistic. Success in these
endeavors has been recognized by funding of several multicomponent grants: continued funding for a Program
Project Grant in BMT, the BMT Clinical Trials Network (CTN) Core Center Grant and the AIDs Malignancy
Consortium, as well as new funding of a myeloma Stand Up to Cancer grant, a Moonshot grant to study BMT
in brain cancers, and a multi-institutional grant to study CHIP and myelodysplastic syndromes in sickle cell
disease. In addition, the Program has played a vigorous role in the development and execution of relevant
clinical trials, including national cooperative group endeavors of ECOG-ACRIN, COG, NCTN, ETCTN, the BMT
CTN and the AIDS Malignancy Consortium, with many examples of therapeutic strategies taken from the
laboratory, through early clinical testing and into national multi-institutional trials."

 The Cancer Immunology (CI) Program of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC)
became a formal CCSG Program in 1998 and has steadily grown over the past two decades. Led by Julie
Brahmer, M.D., Drew Pardoll, M.D., Ph.D., and Erika Pearce, Ph.D., the Program consists of 32 Full Program
Members, 18 of whom have peer-reviewed funding, and an additional four Associate Members, including two
with active K awards during this last funding period. The total direct cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding is
$8.8 million with $3.5 million from the National Cancer Institute. The total number of publications by Program
Members since last renewal is 593, of which 26% are Intra-Programmatic, 47.2% are Inter-Programmatic and
63.7% have external collaborations. Of these publications, 26.8% are in journals with impact factors >10 and
13.2% in journals with impact factors >25. CI has been dedicated to the basic study of immune regulation and
the translation of these findings to the development of novel cancer therapies. Noted accomplishments include
the demonstration that a combination of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylases inhibitors can inhibit
myeloid-derived suppressor cells from establishing metastatic niches, and discovery of a macrophage
molecule, HIDE1, that mediates macrophage inhibition of T cell antitumor immunity. Seminal studies that
glutamine metabolic inhibition decreases tumor cell fitness while converting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
from a memory to an effector state led to the in-house development of a prodrug glutamine inhibitor now in
clinical testing. Early translational work led to trials with immune-targeted metabolic drugs, the first triple
checkpoint inhibitor trial (anti-PD-1/anti-TIGIT/anti-PVRIG), and precision vaccination with mutant Ras peptide
vaccines in pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Leadership of late-stage trials led to a positive anti-PD-1 +
LAG3 Phase III approval trial in melanoma (based upon the original SKCCC discovery of LAG3 as a T cell
checkpoint in the mid-2000s), a positive Phase III approval trial of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 + chemotherapy in
lung cancer, the definitive establishment of PD-L1 expression as a companion diagnostic for first-line lung
cancer treatment with anti-PD-1 and the first FDA approval for a cancer type-agnostic genetic biomarker—
microsatellite instability (MSI) mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd)—for treatment with an anti-PD-1 cancer
drug. These accomplishments fall under the three fundamental Aims of the CI Program mission: Aim 1) to
define molecules and pathways that regulate immune responses relevant to cancer; Aim 2) to integrate animal
models and cutting-edge analysis of clinical material in bidirectional forward and reverse translation to define
mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance, and novel targets and combination strategies to overcome
resistance; Aim 3) to leverage insights from Aims 1 and 2 to develop and clinically validate novel
immunotherapies, define predictive biomarkers to guide precision immunotherapy, and lead national approval
trials that translate CI discoveries into standard-of-care cancer immunotherapy."

Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Individuals with TBM show a marked
deficiency in the levels of glutathione (GSH), the principal non-protein thiol responsible for cellular
homeostasis and maintaining the intracellular redox balance. Since the current anti-TB regimen is
formulated for pulmonary TB, they are not optimal for treating TBM. Thus, adjunctive immunotherapy is a
promising approach to improving the clinical outcome of refractory mycobacterial infections in these cases.
 We have reported that GSH has direct antimycobacterial activity in vitro and at physiological
concentrations. In combination with cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-12, GSH enhances the functional activity
of natural killer (NK) cells to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inside human monocytes.
Similarly, GSH activates the functions of T lymphocytes to control Mtb infection inside human monocytes. In
our previous R15 award, we demonstrated that GSH deficiency in the lungs resulted in increased Mtb burden
in the lungs and spleen. Furthermore, GSH restoration resulted in favorable immune responses in the lungs
leading to improved control of Mtb infection. Importantly, we reported that GSH has additive effects in
improving the ability of rifampicin (RIF) to control Mtb infection. Put together, our findings 1) unfold a novel
and potentially important innate defense mechanism adopted by human macrophages to control Mtb
infection and 2) indicate that GSH controls Mtb infection by functioning as an antimycobacterial agent as well
as by enhancing the effector functions of immune cells. However, the underlying mechanisms by which
GSH deficiency alters the immune responses leading to increased susceptibility to TBM remains
unknown, and the potential use of GSH as a possible therapeutic agent for TBM remains untapped.
The translational aspect of the studies proposed in this grant application may lay the foundation for the
development of adjunctive pharmacotherapy to improve TBM treatment. Our long-term goals are to acquire a
detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of TBM in various settings such as in pediatric subjects and in
those with HIV infection and develop novel therapies to combat TBM."

Neurologic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (neuro-PASC) is a pressing public health issue and
little is known about the cause, duration, and potential treatments. It is defined as a new health problem occurring
three months after initial COVID infection and lasting for at least two months. Common symptoms of neuro-
PASC include headache, inattention, cognitive impairment, dizziness, insomnia, and mood changes. Emerging
evidence suggests that persistent microvascular inflammation and dysfunction play critical roles in the PASC of
the lungs and heart. Numerous post-mortem studies have demonstrated significant microvascular damage and
dysfunction in the brains of individuals who have died of acute COVID-19. In the brains of individuals living with
neuro-PASC, case-control studies have found microvascular dysfunction, cerebral hypoperfusion, and new small
vessel disease. The long-term neurologic effects of microvascular dysfunction and subsequent risk of vascular
dementia is unknown. I hypothesize that cerebral microvascular dysfunction plays a critical role in neuro-
PASC cognitive impairment and puts individuals at risk for progression of small vessel disease.
Here, I propose utilizing advanced vascular MRI techniques to investigate for biomarkers of microvascular
dysfunction in the brain to better understand the pathophysiology of neuro-PASC and risk for progression of
small vessel disease. Understanding the underlying disease process will bring us closer to identifying biomarkers
and treatment targets. In order to enrich the probability of finding MRI alterations, I will recruit participants with
cognitive impairment, which is the most common and well-documented neuro-PASC symptom. I will conduct a
longitudinal study and perform two sets of MRIs, blood tests, and neuropsychological tests on each participant.
I will recruit at least 50 adults with a documented COVID-19 infection and cognitive symptoms and compare
them to 50 adults with a documented COVID-19 infection and no residual symptoms (controls). My detailed MRI
protocol will evaluate the vessel wall, arterial, and venous vasculature and explore techniques to map the
lymphatic vasculature. In the blood, I will test markers of coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and neurodegeneration.
I am a neurologist and physician-scientist who has developed clinical and scientific expertise in neuro-PASC
through caring for patients in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale, and I am working in the neuro-infectious disease
laboratory of my primary mentor. I recently graduated from fellowship, and I am now an Instructor in the
Department of Neurology. My long-term goal is to become an independent clinician-scientist with a focus on
utilizing neuroimaging techniques to understand the pathophysiology of neuro-PASC and generate biomarkers
of disease and treatment targets. To accomplish this goal, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with
experts in neuroradiology, neuropsychology, and neuro-ID. I will take advanced coursework in neuroimaging,
statistics, and vascular biology. The completion of this mentored award will prepare me to become an
independent physician-scientist and allow me to make meaningful contributions to the field and to patient care."
10884153,"We propose a set of studies focused on the association of suicide with neuroinflammation and
compromise of the blood-brain barrier, with the goal of identifying a pattern of quantifiable abnormalities that
could serve as a biomarker for imminent suicidal risk in our Veterans. Autopsy studies are uniquely suited to do
this, because they capture the state of the brain at the time of the suicidal act.
 Findings from our laboratories and others indicate that susceptibility to suicide includes inflammatory
activation in the brain and systemically, accompanied by compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier: (1)
Most directly, we reported increased densities of microglia or other phagocytic cells associated with blood
vessels in dorsal prefrontal white matter of people who died by suicide, Similar results are reported in cingulate
white matter. (2) Studies of brains from individuals who died by suicide and studies of blood and CSF from live
individuals who had previously attempted suicide found elevations of inflammatory cytokines. (3) Various
infectious diseases are associated with increased risk of suicide, as is a history of hospitalization for any
infection. (4) Laboratory animals exposed to stress show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased
permeability of the blood-brain barrier, behavioral abnormalities, and activation of microglia. (5) We have
reported an association of suicide with a polymorphism and decreased frontal and cingulate transcripts for
CD44, which is involved in the normal function of the BBB. (6) Biochemical measures suggesting BBB
impairment are reportedly associated with attempted suicide and with suicidal ideation. (7) In MDD subjects
who died by suicide, compared with nonpsychiatric non-suicide cases, we found differential methylation of
genes associated with cell death, both in whole cortical homogenates and in purified neuronal fractions. We
also found significantly lower methylation in the promoter of the gene for CCL3, a powerful inflammatory
cytokine synthesized by microglia and astrocytes and an attractant for microglia and white blood cells, but this
difference was not present in the purified neuronal fraction.
 Taken together, these findings lead us to hypothesize a suicidal state characterized by impaired BBB
function, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and abnormalities in DNA methylation of genes stimulating
inflammation, all of which can be assessed in live individuals. To confirm this phenotype, we propose three
specific aims, each employing the same set of 90 autopsy brains, already collected. In order to distinguish
features of suicide from those of psychiatric illness, we employ a 3-group design with 30 cases of psychiatric
disease and suicide, 30 cases of psychiatric disease without suicide, and 30 cases with neither psychiatric
disease nor suicide, all from a well-characterized collection with a single collection protocol at a single autopsy
service. To optimize our ability to distinguish features of suicide from those of psychiatric disease, in addition to
finding the best matches between groups by age and sex, we sought to limit all of the psychiatric cases to a
single clinical group, which was best achieved with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Our specific aims, for
each of which we will assay cerebral cortex and white matter from dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions, are:
(1) To evaluate functional BBB impairment by stereological assessment of perivascular deposits of fibronectin.
(2) To quantify a panel of cytokines, and to look for structural evidence of BBB impairment by assaying isolated
microvessel fractions for vascular tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases.(3) To identify
transcriptional correlates of BBB alterations with a genome-wide methylation survey on microvessel fractions of
cortex and white matter from each region, using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray .These data
will allow us to establish the underlying abnormalities for development of a suicidal profile to better, identify and
treat veterans at risk of suicide. Knowledge and application of this profile will save Veterans’ lives by identifying
potential targets for novel clinical interventions."

The overall goal of this research is to better understand the analgesic properties of central noradrenergic
systems. Emotional regulation in the face of physical injury and psychological trauma is critical to long-term
survival and quality of life. Uncontrollable anxiety, anhedonia, and depression often result following periods of
prolonged stress or chronic pain. Both chronic pain and stress lead to overlapping physiological adaptations
such that the same tricyclic and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) developed and used to
treat depression are also effective in treating chronic pain. Therefore, norepinephrine (NE) is likely one of the
key neurotransmitters regulating pain processing during stress. In this proposal we seek to define the role of
NE in stress-induced modification of pain. The locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NE) system is one particular
central nervous system target that holds promise for interventions in both chronic pain and stress-induced
psychiatric disorders. This research focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which the LC-NE system
modulates endogenous analgesia and how chronic stress affects this system. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that LC-NE neuronal activity is critical for stress-induced modulation of nociception. The first aim of
this proposal will assess the role of LC-NE neurons in acute stress-induced antinociception using in vivo
optogenetics and chemogenetics. The second aim seeks to understand the mechanism for the transition from
acute stress-induced antinociception to chronic stress-induced pronociception. In particular, this aim seeks to
determine whether repeated LC-NE stimulation from repeated stress exposure drives stress-induced
pronociception. To do so we will use, using in vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, and intersectional genetic
models to remove LC-NE function during repeated restraint stress. The final aim seeks to clarify how two
different models for studying chronic stress reveal opposing pain-related phenotypes. Here, we will use brain
slice electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry to monitor LC-NE activity following these stress paradigms
and in response to noxious stimuli. Together these experiments will generate previously unattainable
information about LC-NE neurons and associated efferent circuitry that regulate the pain-related behaviors in
response to stressors. These studies will define the role of the LC-NE system; 1) in acute stress-induced
analgesia, 2) the transition to chronic stress-induced hyperalgesia, and 3) identify mechanisms by which
different forms of stress alter LC-NE function and nociception. This information will be critical for translational
research targeting the noradrenergic system in the treatment of pain and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10884234,"Project Summary
Arthropod-borne flaviviruses and respiratory-transmitted coronaviruses have the potential to cause severe
epidemics and pandemics. One strategy to prepare for and respond to viral outbreaks is to develop drugs that
target host factors viruses require to complete their lifecycles. Through a series of CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption
screens, we identified transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) and the closely related vacuole membrane
protein 1 (VMP1) as critical pan-flavivirus and pan-coronavirus host factors. Both proteins are highly conserved
lipid scramblases with roles in autophagy. Our current model is that viruses from both the Flavivirdae and
Coronaviridae families hijack TMEM41B and VMP1 for their ability to remodel ER membranes and induce
membrane curvature to establish membrane-protected viral RNA replication organelles.
 Our overall goal for this proposal is to understand how, on a mechanistic level, both proteins support
flavivirus and coronavirus infection. Our previous work indicates that TMEM41B is required at a post-entry step
at or prior to viral RNA replication. In Aim 1, we will interrogate early events of the virus lifecycle including primary
translation, polyprotein processing, and replication organelle formation in WT, TMEM41B and VMP1 knockout
(KO) cells to determine how far the flavivirus and coronavirus lifecycles progress in the absence of either protein.
 We previously showed that lack of TMEM41B and VMP1, induces a heightened innate immune response
upon flavivirus infection. We hypothesize that both proteins are recruited to sites of viral RNA replication, and
that in their absence, RNA replication initiates and viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced. However,
without a proper replication organelle dsRNA is exposed and triggers an innate immune response. Alternatively,
given TMEM41B’s and VMP1’s lipid scramblase activity and function in lipid homeostasis, their absence may
induce ER stress, which triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) that in synergy with dsRNA may cause a
heightened innate immune response. In Aim 2, we will test virus infection in double KO cells that lack either
protein in addition to genes that are essential for pathogen sensing, IFN signaling, and UPR activation. We will
further conduct RNAseq experiments to investigate lack of TMEM41B in stem cells and stem cell-derived
primary-like cells representing different tissue lineages in the absence and presence of viral replication.
 Lastly, in Aim 3, will use a panel of phenotypic and mechanistic assays to characterize naturally occurring
SNPs in TMEM41B that we previously found to impact flavivirus replication, and several reported VMP1 loss-of-
function mutants. We will further take a deep mutational scanning approach to comprehensively characterize
TMEM41B and VMP1 and determine if any domains or amino acids are differentially required for their cellular
and proviral functions. This functional characterization will identify mutants that can be studied in detail in
mechanistic assays and may identify amino acids or interfaces in both proteins that can be targeted to prevent
virus infection with minimal disruption to cellular biology."

 Metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release widely throughout
the CNS and is required for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and amygdala,
suggesting a central role in synaptic plasticity. Recently, primary mutations in the GRM7 gene have been linked
to intellectual disability, stereotypies, and seizures, symptoms common in neurodevelopmental disorders.
Additionally, we have found that mGlu7 protein levels are significantly reduced in the brains of patients clinically
diagnosed with the neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT). Loss-of-function mutations in Methyl
CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulation of transcription, are the major cause of RTT, which is a
disease resulting in the development of stereotyped behaviors, motor delays, anxiety, cognitive deficits, autistic
features, seizures, and apneas. Consistent with reductions in mGlu7 in RTT patients and model mice, potentiating
mGlu7 activity with small molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) corrects multiple synaptic plasticity,
cognitive, social, and respiratory phenotypes in mice with an Mecp2 knockout (KO) allele. These early studies
employed a compound that was not selective for mGlu7 versus several other metabotropic glutamate receptors.
We have recently optimized VU6027459, a highly selectivity mGlu7 tool that exhibits suitable pharmacokinetic
parameters for in vivo rodent use. Using VU6027459, we have further validated a role for mGlu7 potentiation in
reversing abnormal RTT phenotypes. We propose to use the monogenetic disorder of RTT, in tandem with a
drug development campaign, as a clinical entry path for the development of mGlu7 PAMs; it is anticipated that
future studies could then expand into alternate indications, such as primary epilepsies or schizophrenia.
 Our previous RTT studies have focused on patients and mice with an MECP2/Mecp2 allele that is a functional
null. A large proportion of RTT patients, however, have single point mutations in the MECP2 gene, and our
preliminary data suggest that there are differences in mGlu7 expression levels in human RTT tissue that correlate
with specific mutations. This indicates that therapeutics for efficacy testing in this disease require preclinical
validation in various mouse models that reflect this clinical heterogeneity. Using an expanded clinical sample set
and mice modeling different mutations, we will test the hypothesis that mGlu7 levels may be differentially
impacted in the context of distinct MECP2 mutations and determine if specific mutations underlie disease states
most likely to exhibit efficacious and safe responses to mGlu7 PAMs or if mGlu7 PAMs will have utility across the
entire mutation spectrum. Finally, we will perform biomarker studies that build upon our findings that Mecp2-
deficient mice exhibit EEG spectral changes and reductions in REM sleep across the disease course. These
findings mirror sleep abnormalities seen in RTT patients, suggesting that EEG represents a clinically translatable
and noninvasive biomarker for the program."
10884337,"Abstract
Rickettsiae are a group of arthropod-associated, obligately intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that are closely
related but potentially cause life-threatening infection in humans. Tick-borne rickettsioses (TBRs) are
increasingly posing serious threat to the public health in the US due to increased incidence and lack of
commercially available vaccine for prevention. Therefore, a safe and effective vaccine against TBRs will be
an important resource that will ensure the Nation’s capability to prevent this group of diseases. Our long-
term goal is to develop novel approaches for safe and effective immunoprophylaxis of TBRs. Our recently
published and pilot studies demonstrated that live-attenuated R. parkeri mutant 3A2 conferred full protection
against lethal challenge of two highly virulent rickettsiae in mouse models, accompanied by generating high titers
of IgG antibodies reactive against several pathogenic rickettsial species and significantly elevated type 1 T cell
memory immunity. These findings support the proof-of-concept that live-attenuated vaccine candidate serves a
feasible and effective approach to prevent TBRs and study vaccine-induced memory immunity against TBRs.
Thus, the objectives of this R01 application are to generate a safe and efficacious live-attenuated vaccine
(LAV) against TBRs, define the protective efficacy of LAV against homologous and heterologous rickettsial
strains, and mechanistically determine the immune correlates of vaccine-elicited protection against tick
transmission of TBRs. To achieve these objectives, we propose three specific aims to test the central
hypothesis that the LAV will elicit high quality CD8+ T memory cells and rickettsiae-specific neutralizing
antibodies to confer complete protection against natural acquisition of TBRs as a safe and efficacious polyvalent
vaccine candidate. Aim 1 will optimize R. parkeri mutants genetically to reduce virulence, enhance safety while
maintaining immunogenicity. Aim 2 will define the efficacy of genetically optimized R. parkeri mutants in
protecting against TBRs in both needle-challenge and tick transmission animal models. Aim 3 will identify the
immunological correlates of vaccine-induced protection against TBRs. Upon the completion of the proposed
research, we expect to define the first multivalent vaccine candidate for TBR and reveal the novel elements of
host immunity responsible for prevention from natural transmission of TBRs. This will have significant positive
effects on human health because it will provide the basic information required to ultimately develop a safe,
effective, and tractable vaccine against TBRs."

Women in South Asia often return to their natal homes in different communities during pregnancy, for childbirth,
and postpartum. Our team conducted the first robust measurement of this phenomenon in two states of India
(coining the term “temporary childbirth migration (TCM)”) and found that about one-third of women returned to
the natal home point during the perinatal period. Given India’s reliance on community-based maternal and child
health care delivery, TCM may disrupt care continuity, negatively impacting health care access and health
outcomes. Conversely, given the lower status of women in their marital homes, TCM could potentially improve
health outcomes for migrants, leaving those “left behind” at higher health risk. A greater understanding of TCM,
its impact, and associated mechanisms are critical inputs to inform policy and practice to improve maternal and
neonatal health in India. However, despite anecdotal evidence of TCM’s widespread prevalence across diverse
Indian contexts and its potential impact on health, it is not well defined or quantified in the literature. The objective
of this study is to characterize TCM in India, describe its impact on perinatal outcomes, and explore the health
care continuity and social support as potential mediators of these relationships. First, we will collect cross-
sectional data from roughly 6000 women at eight Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites throughout India
to define and characterize temporary childbirth migration, including magnitude, timing, drivers, and
sociodemographic and geographic heterogeneity. Triadic qualitative interviews with household members in 2
sites will shed additional light on selection and drivers of TCM. Then, we will select three sites based on
geographical distribution and differing levels of TCM for a longitudinal study. We will recruit 1000 women in each
site (3000 total) who are early in pregnancy and follow them until one year postpartum, some of whom will
migrate and some not. We will collect monthly telephone surveys and five longer in-depth surveys from women
about migration patterns, health care use, maternal and child health outcomes, social support, and socio-
demographics. We will ask women to take photographs on their mobile phones (provided to those without
phones) of health record data to have higher quality maternal and infant outcome data. We will estimate the
impact of TCM on preterm birth and identify women most at risk. We will then examine disruptions in the
continuum of perinatal care and social support as potential mediators between temporary childbirth migration
and health. These findings will help us understand factors that may be contributing to poor maternal and child
health outcomes in India, and potentially other parts of South Asia and other regions. A better understanding of
the impact of TCM can help programs and policies better support women to obtain the care and support they
need in pregnancy and postpartum."

 HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are
especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission
in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend
frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due
to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and
discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV
prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While
surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past-
year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self-
reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve
viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.
 Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore
urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to
overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV
epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided
behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in
recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are
many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in
person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly
stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa,
and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing
while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM,
including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces
and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of
automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial
intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to
mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase).
Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate
the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual."

 While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold enormous promise for treating many challenging
diseases, a major barrier toward clinically meaningful MSC therapies is the inability to produce potent MSCs
consistently. Specifically, in vitro cultured MSCs often rapidly enter senescence in which they lose their potency.
In contrast to natural in vivo senescence, such in vitro aging has been shown to be largely driven by misregulated
metabolic signaling in culture. To address this grand challenge, many signaling pathways (e.g., FGF, ATM, SRT,
mTOR, EGF, DDR2) have been identified for regulating senescence-related processes. Building upon these
discoveries, this R35 MIRA proposal aims to develop an innovative engineering approach to delaying the MSC
senescence process by collectively adjusting these signaling pathways. Specifically, we hypothesize that a
sufficiently trained AI model can predict the signaling factor combination that effectively slows down or even
reverts the senescence-related transcriptional drift. To achieve such a goal, my research aims to address three
knowledge/technology gaps in MSC engineering (Fig. 1B): 1) how to accurately phenotype live MSCs (e.g.,
characteristics, proliferation, and potency); 2) how to predict signaling factors that dictate the desired
transcriptional response; and 3) how to ensure the robustness of such predictions.
 In challenge 1, this proposal will expand our previously developed AI platform by developing approaches
to acquiring large-scale AI training data that cover a wide range of MSC phenotypes and interpreting black-box
deep learning models. The goal is to decipher the morphology-gene expression relationship in MSCs. In
challenge 2, we will utilize deep learning to identify the signaling factor combination and predictively adjust gene
expression in MSCs. In the third challenge, we will develop algorithms that improve the robustness of AI models
and turn our proof-of-concept AI platforms into reliable tools for practical clinical utilizations. The immediate
outcome of our proposed research will lead to a high-throughput phenotyping and engineering platform of MSCs.
The proposed experimental platform will also enable us to establish better understandings in MSC
mechanobiology and senescence signaling interactions."

The Endocrine Training Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, directed by Dr. Barbara Kahn,
trains MD, MD/PhD and PhD postdoctoral candidates in the research areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and
metabolism. The goal of the program is to foster the development of the next generation of trainees into
independent investigators in endocrinology and metabolism, who will excel in scientific investigation and
succeed in obtaining faculty positions in at major universities and medical schools. A secondary goal is to
provide a rigorous scientific foundation for fellows who will go on to careers as clinician-educators. The
research faculty for the endocrine program is an experienced group of investigators, all of whom are Harvard
Medical School faculty members involved in the comprehensive study of obesity, diabetes, ""the metabolic
syndrome"", nuclear receptor action, neuroendocrinology and signal transduction. The faculty is comprised of
basic scientists and clinical scientists who work together to train fellows to investigate research questions at
the molecular and physiological levels. The collaborative nature of the faculty is evidenced by multiple joint
publications and shared research core facilities as part of the Boston area NIH-funded Nutrition-Obesity
Research Centers and Diabetes Endocrinology Research Centers. Trainees are provided an opportunity to
learn from the collective expertise of the faculty in the areas of hormone action, regulation of gene expression,
adipocyte biology, animal physiology, gene targeting approaches to endocrine and metabolic disorders,
neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, research in human subjects, and strategies for novel treatment
modalities. Our trainees have an outstanding record of obtaining independent funding and promotion to faculty
positions. These funded investigators now participate in the training of fellows in this and other Programs in
Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism around the country. Since the last competitive renewal of this grant,
the Division has added new, talented faculty and has expanded its research space and core facilities. In
particular, the program is strongly supported by core facilities at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and
transgenic mouse generation. The program has further formalized its curriculum in the Responsible Conduct of
Research. The success of the trainees reflects the outstanding quality of this Endocrine Training Program."
10884793,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will suffer from a fragility fracture in their
remaining lifetime. Fragility hip fracture is one of the most serious and debilitating outcomes of osteoporosis with
a 20–40% mortality rate during the first year after the fracture. Hip fracture incidence rates are known to increase
exponentially with age in both women and men; and with the rising life expectancy throughout the globe, the
number of men and women who will be above the threshold of fragility fracture is expected to almost double,
with a prediction of 319 million cases by 2040. Thus, the number of fractures is predicted to double as well.
 In this Direct Phase II SBIR, BioSensics, in collaboration with orthopaedic, radiology, endocrinology and
biomechanics experts at Harvard Medical School, proposes to develop a cloud-based software solution for
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images, called XFx. X-ray studies are
ubiquitous in all corners of the world, are inexpensive and provide high resolution studies that offer insight into
bone geometry, microstructure and density, at a low ionizing radiation dose. The proposed software solution will
include 1) a desktop application for uploading X-ray images and displaying and visualizing XFx results, and 2) a
secure cloud-based backend for receiving the uploaded X-ray images and performing the analysis. The software
architecture will support on-premise integration with a hospital cloud services (e.g., PACS systems) to enable
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images. The solution will stand by in the
central imaging data server of hospitals or clinics, investigate each non-investigated X-ray image, and if
recognized to include a proximal femur, automatically execute the AI/ML-based classification scheme to identify
patients with osteoporosis or at high risk of hip fracture. If a patient is identified to have osteoporosis or a high
risk of fracture, the software will flag the patient. The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted
to consider ordering an evaluation of fragility fracture risk and receive a full report.
 This process is reimbursable under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 76499 “Unlisted
Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.” This code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. The
existence of this CPT will support the initial marketing of the proposed solution. In Phase III, we will prepare an
application for a new Category III CPT code and submit if for consideration by the American Medical Association
(AMA) CPT Editorial Panel. Given the clinical need of the proposed solution, and recent approval of a CPT code
for radiology artificial intelligence (code 0691T) for automated analysis of existing imaging studies for vertebral
fracture and bone density assessment, our application for a new CPT code should not face any difficulties. In
the longer term, the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of
medical images that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and
conditions at early stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and
better care for those individuals at risk."

 This proposal seeks to better understand the contribution of cortical inhibitory interneuron subtypes to network
dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) utilizing a well controlled and characterized mouse model,
the central fluid percussion injury. Our group has identified significant and differential dysfunction in neocortical
interneuron subtypes after mTBI in this model. Parvalbumin interneurons (PV) modulate gamma oscillations
recorded from EEG that is critical for sensory perception. The PV are particularly vulnerable after injury, with
10% being axotomized and the output from PV to local pyramidal neurons being significantly reduced. In contrast
somatostatin-containing interneurons (SOM) show little axotomy and have an increased output onto local
pyramidal neurons. In other disease models the link between the ratio of PV:SOM and altered gamma levels has
been well established. We hypothesize that injury also alters this ratio and that alteration underlies the increase
in resting gamma and the decrease in evoked gamma that we and others have observed. We will test that here
using chemogenetics and mutant mice with altered PV:SOM ratios. In addition we will test the link of that altered
gamma to an increased sensitivity to touch and lowered pain threshold. We further hypothesize that the reason
PV are vulnerable is due to the activation of microglia which subsequently degrade the perineuronal nets (PNN)
that normally surround the PV. Once the PNN are removed PV function is likely reduced due to reactive oxygen
species. Each aspect of these hypotheses will be tested by depleting microglia and by treating the oxidative
stress with N-Acetylcysteine. Outcome measures will include the power of the gamma recorded from EEG, pain
threshold via von Frey filaments, whisker nuisance test score, the percent of axotomized PV and SOM
interneurons, the intracellularly recorded function of the PV and SOM and the level of output from PV and SOM.
These studies will determine if this cellular dysfunction underlies the abnormal network function and altered
cognition after mTBI."
10880963,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. While most prostate
cancers are hormone sensitive and respond well to hormone therapy, a subset of patients will relapse with
lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is still unclear why some prostate tumors remain indolent yet
others rapidly progress and relapse on therapy. As such there is an urgent need for new biomarkers of disease
progression and novel therapeutic targets and strategies for treatment-refractory prostate cancer. We and
others have identified markers of cellular senescence, a stress-induced program driven by oncogenic insult, in
prostate cancers from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and human patients. As senescence
leads to durable cell cycle arrest and induction of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that
can activate immune clearance of senescent cells, it has historically been thought that senescence may act as
a natural barrier to tumorigenesis. However, more recent evidence has demonstrated that chronic senescence
and SASP production can alternatively lead to systemic inflammation that sets the stage of tumor development
and subsequent progression and metastasis. Whether senescence or specific senescent cell types functionally
contribute to prostate cancer onset, progression, and immune suppression remains unknown.
To address this question, we have crossed GEMMs we have developed that recapitulate the early and late
stages of prostate tumorigenesis with p16-3MR mice that allow tracking and depletion of p16+ senescent cells.
Using these models and prostate cancer patient samples we observed that markers of cellular senescence
remain elevated during disease progression and can be found in multiple heterogenous cell types, and that
depletion of senescent cells can block tumor formation and reverse immune suppression. As such we
hypothesize that senescent cells promote prostate immune suppression and tumorigenesis and their targeting
can reactivate immune-mediated tumor control. In Aim 1, we will use multiplexed staining, single cell spatial
transcriptomics, and ex vivo functional analyzes to identify and phenotypically characterize distinct populations
of senescent cells during disease progression in prostate cancer GEMMs and patient samples. In Aim 2,
genetic and pharmacological tools will be used to assess the impact of senescent cell depletion (i.e. senolysis)
and SASP suppression on tumor progression. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether senolytic therapy can reverse
prostate immune suppression and potentiate currently ineffective anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
therapy to drive immune-mediated prostate cancer control in the preclinical setting. Collectively, these
approaches have the potential to not only advance our basic mechanistic understanding of how senescence-
mediated inflammation can foster tumorigenesis, but also guide the translational development of (a) prognostic
biomarkers of aggressive disease and (b) new therapeutic targets and strategies for treating prostate cancer."
10870692,"Project Summary
Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency associated with high risk of neurologic decline and
readmission. Mortality, length of stay, and cost all increase when patients in SE progress to refractory status
epilepticus (RSE). SE is clinically heterogenous and broadly defined, which is a barrier to conducting
randomized trials and contributes to pervasive diagnostic delays and treatment variability. Further, rare
subtypes of SE, such as New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) remain poorly understood. Case
definitions that are extractible from the electronic health record (EHR) are necessary for a population-level
approach to surveillance of SE, including NORSE, aimed at identifying high risk groups and associated
conditions and exposures, supporting early diagnosis, determining incidence, establishing natural history and
targeting of therapies. EHR and administrative case definitions for SE do not exist, and current methods of
identifying patients with SE using only structured EHR data are prone to bias. In general, prediction models
using only structured data often have limited utility.
To our knowledge, our proposed project is the first attempt at large-scale multidimensional phenotyping for SE
using unstructured data. We hypothesize that generating consensus around the spectrum of clinical
phenotypes of SE and using Natural Language Processing (NLP), to identify and classify SE is an essential
first step for the creation of SE registries and comparative effectiveness and pragmatic trials of RSE
prevention. In Aim 1, we will apply an innovative sequential mixed methods approach, using (a) a modified
Delphi method to establish consensus around labels to identify relevant information elements (“ground truth”)
and (b) a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to rank identify time-evolving attributes of SE. This will allow us to
study whether attributes are weighted differently during a SE admission, and whether risk trajectories toward
developing RSE are identifiable. In Aim 2, we will leverage unstructured EHR data from two large academic
centers and apply NLP to develop a standardized data extraction model of symptom dimensions, clinical
features, and complex concepts of SE from EHRs. Such a model could then categorize SE by clinical
outcomes, specifically RSE. Such a tool lays an essential foundation for future comparative effectiveness and
pragmatic trials of potentially modifiable preventive factors of RSE, leading to the development of clinical
decision support tools, quality metrics, and performance measures for SE and RSE management."

Beryllium (Be) is used in several industries and the US is the largest exporter of Be in the world. Despite
mitigation strategies, Be exposure at the workplace results in Be sensitization (BeS) and Chronic Beryllium
Disease (CBD). CBD is an important but understudied organ-specific immune-mediated disease characterized
by granulomatous lung inflammation, fibrosis, and death. Hence, CBD is a public health concern resulting in
the promulgation of new exposure standards recently. BeS develops in up to 20% of Be-exposed individuals
and progresses to CBD in 50-100% of these at-risk individuals. The goal of this study is to determine if
complement activation in nasal and bronchial epithelial cells perpetuates the immune response contributing to
the exposure-mediated immune disease, CBD. This project hypothesizes that nasal and bronchial epithelial
cells share common CBD-related and complement-related gene expression and activation, leading to
enhanced immune responses to Be-exposure in BeS and CBD. In Aim 1, the study will determine gene
expression profiling from paired nasal and bronchial brushings cells in CBD and BeS as compared to healthy
controls, primarily focused on complement genes and pathways. We will determine Be-related airway epithelial
cells transcription of paired nasal and bronchial brushings cells in BeS (n=16), CBD (n=16), and controls
(n=10). We aim to 1) investigate if gene expression profiling of nasal brushings is similar to that of bronchial
brushings, and to determine whether nasal brushing can be used as a non-invasive biomarker of the lower
airways in the study of CBD. 2) analyze gene expression levels of complement pathway gene expression. In
Aim 2, the study will validate the complement genes identified as key drivers of immune response to Be in
epithelial cells. We will use patient-autologous CD4+ T cells and bronchial epithelial cells grown at air-liquid
interface (ALI) co-culture models. Specifically, we will use the CRISPR-dCas9 system to target the expression
of candidate complement genes (knockdown and overexpression) in airway epithelial cells and determine the
impact of complement activation on CD4+ T cell Th1 responses to Be. At the completion of this project, the
proposal will enhance our understanding of the identificationcation of novel genes and regulatory pathways
associated with Be lung disease, launching an investigation of novel pathogenic mechanisms and setting the
stage to determining more rapid and non-invasive detection of CBD and BeS in future studies. Finally, this
study will provide a framework to investigate other granulomatous or exposure-related lung diseases, such as
hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis."
10871295,"ABSTRACT
The role of germline genetic variation and viral infection in development and progression has been studied
extensively in adult tumors and autoimmune disease. Less attention has been paid to the interaction of these
factors with birth defects and pediatric malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which in the
youngest patients is driven almost exclusively by structural variants (SVs) with poorly understood etiology. The
prevalence of gene fusion transcripts associated with leukemia at live birth is 10x to 100x greater than the
incidence of childhood leukemia, which suggests other risk factors must interact with SVs. One possible
candidate for interaction is the timing of viral infection, either in parents or children. Clinical trials of gene
therapy with viral vectors failed in part due to viral integrations activating oncogenes such as MECOM. Recent
work has shown a direct mechanism for derivative chromosome formation at the most common breakpoints in
leukemia, and human herpesviruses, including CMV, are one of the single greatest risk factors for
chromosomal birth defects. Elsewhere, we and others have documented germline and somatic copy number
and short sequence variants affecting e26 transformation specific (ETS) factors, which participate in high-risk
gene fusions seen in both solid and liquid tumors. These factors and their binding sites determine
developmental fates across tissues, yet their motifs are short tandem repeats -- the single most variable class
of features in the human genome. Small changes in dosage, as created by haploinsufficiency or variation in
ramp sequences, may be sufficient to predispose individuals to disease. The primary obstacle to studying
either of these mechanisms has long been the small sample sizes and biased coverage of cohorts assembled
for rare and childhood diseases. The vast quantity of whole-genome, whole-transcriptome, and long-read
sequencing data provided by the Gabriella Miller Kids First! (GMKF) Consortium and the INCLUDE cohorts
negate this obstacle. When combined with the thousands of pediatric clinical trial participants in Project: Every
Child, and the forthcoming X01 Long Read Pilot Project for omics-cold pediatric leukemia patients, we posit
that both the computational infrastructure and the sample sizes required for progress are now in place. We
propose to characterize germline regulatory, splicing, and structural variants as catalysts of risk for
leukemia and related preleukemic conditions, noting that triplication of the ETS factor ERG is an inherent
feature of Down syndrome-driven disease (a 500x multiplier for risk over the general population). With
colleagues, we have identified non-coding variants with strong effects in Down syndrome. This suggests that
the combination of sample size, cohort diversity, and representation of the most common structural variants in
human disease within the GMKF! Consortium presents an ideal opportunity to address this urgent need and
determine if predisposition risk can be mitigated by screening or prophylaxis."

critical role in advancing new breakthroughs to improve health outcomes and transform health
care (AAMC, 2023). A growing number of biomedical research training programs, housed in
research institutes, universities, and teaching hospitals, have been established with the goal of
equipping aspiring researchers with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to
contribute to the continuous progress of biomedical research and its potential to positively
impact society. A barrier to the sustained success of such training programs is that they lack the
knowledge, skills, and resources to effectively assess and evaluate the training programs. This
creates a major loophole in the training cycle that fails to inform stakeholders about how well
these training programs position their trainees in integrating interdisciplinary approaches to
answer key biomedical research questions. This project addresses NIGMS’ Enhancing Program
Evaluation Capacity at institutions with biomedical research training programs by developing
online modules to inform program directors and administrators about effective and practical
approaches to evaluate biomedical research training programs. Through this project, we aim to
increase awareness of the importance of evidence-based decision making and enable
biomedical science administrators and other stakeholders with the tools and skill sets to make
program evaluation an on-going, integral component of research training programs from the
beginning rather than a one-time event. Our proposed solution highlights the strength of
decision-making based on systematically collected evidence that improves the quality of
biomedical research training programs and therefore contributes to the development of
biomedical research and global health. The overall goal in this proposal is to equip participants
with the competencies (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) necessary to conduct high-quality
evaluations and make evidence-based decisions to improve program effectiveness and learning
outcomes in biomedical research training programs. To achieve this, we will pursue three
specific training goals: 1) design and develop a comprehensive online training program; 2) pilot
test and refine the educational modules; and 3) disseminate knowledge and strategies on
evaluation through a website, content management system, publications, and presentations.
The training will include seven modules covering main components of program evaluation, from
foundational practices to quantitative and qualitative methods, and to communication of
evaluation results."

external innovative research networks. Three networks continue activities initiated in the last grant cycle related
to aging in Latin America, aging in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the interrelations between migration, health
and aging. Two networks are newly proposed for the next cycle: first, a Global Family Change (GFC) network
that provides overarching global research on family change and aging, thereby providing fundamental compar-
ative research informing multiple PARC themes about the implications of ongoing transformations of society’s
most fundamental building block – the family – for health, well-being and social support of older persons; second,
a network, PICANTES, that is related to two newly-proposed PARC signature themes on Cognition and Alz-
heimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and Health Care and Long-Term Care at Older Ages. All five
networks will enhance interdisciplinary and innovative aging research, not only at PARC but nationally and inter-
nationally, with important outreach activities that will encourage and nurture development of younger research-
ers, including from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Each network includes workshops, collaboration
(also pilot projects), harmonization of large-scale data collection efforts, and the development of common re-
sources. There is deliberate overlap among the five networks in terms of PARC investigators, substance, and
geographic areas of interest, leading to complementarities and synergies among PARC Networks and/or PARC

The primary objective of the Rochester Partnership to Advance Research and Academic Careers of Deaf
(RPP-DEAF) Scholars is to rigorously train and support the career advancement of deaf and hard of hearing
(D/HH) post-doctoral Scholars for independent academic careers that support the biomedical research
enterprise. This is an important unmet national need, because the D/HH community is greatly
underrepresented in the biomedical sciences academic workforce. In order to address this disparity, we have
partnered the faculty and programs of the University of Rochester (UR) with those of the Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT) and its National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). To achieve our program goals, we
will pursue four Specific Aims; 1) To provide outstanding program leadership that “mentors the mentors”, builds
community for D/HH Scholars, and successfully coordinates program recruitment. This goal will be achieved
through (A) special training specific to this IRACDA program (including training in Deaf-aware mentoring
practices and Deaf culture), (B) training in mentoring diverse learners and (C) advanced mentoring training (for
research mentors) or leadership mentoring training (for program leaders).; 2) To provide individualized,
mentored teaching experiences and career development activities for all Scholars. Teaching experiences will
be provided principally at RIT/NTID, the teaching-intensive partner institution.; 3) To provide individualized,
mentored research experiences for all Scholars. Research experiences will be provided principally at UR, the
research-intensive partner institution.; and 4) To rigorously, comprehensively and continuously evaluate the
RPP-DEAF program. We will ensure that RPP-DEAF meets its goals by conducting comprehensive and
ongoing program evaluation of: Scholar Achievement, Faculty Mentorship & Program Leadership; and
Institutional Impact. We will recruit three new D/HH scholars per year, with a maximum of a three-year
appointment, in order to maintain a steady state cohort of 9 D/HH Scholars. Overall, this unique IRACDA
program will equip our Scholars with the comprehensive set of knowledge and skills in research, teaching and
professionalism necessary for successful academic careers - with the goal that all of our Scholars will acheive
full-time academic appointments in higher education and/or research institutions. This innovative inter-
institutional partnership is the first of its kind in the world and will begin to address the dearth of D/HH faculty at
academic institutions serving the nation's biomedical research needs. A long-term outcome will be the
attraction of more D/HH Scholars into careers in the biomedical sciences, a field in which D/HH persons are
greatly underrepresented."
10875477,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
A key role of the TME in cancer progression, treatment resistance, and as a target for therapeutic intervention is increasingly appreciated. Noninvasive in vivo EPR-based spectroscopy and imaging of tissue oxygenation (pO{2}), extracellular pH (pH{e}), redox, glutathione (GSH) and interstitial inorganic phosphate (Pi) provide unique insights into biological processes in the TME, and may serve as a tool for preclinical screening of anticancer drugs and optimizing TME-targeted therapeutic strategies. In this competitive renewal application, our new directions are built on knowledge and discoveries made during the previous funding period. There are two goals of our R01 renewal proposal. First is to further advance paramagnetic probes and magnetic resonance technology with a focus on improving probes biocompatibility, functionality, and developing multifunctional imaging modalities. Second is to utilize these advances and knowledge accumulated using spectroscopic modalities in the initial R01 project period to obtain further insights into the role of TME in cancer progression, and to test our hypothesis on the roles of interstitial inorganic phosphate in tumorigenesis. The specific aims are: (SA1) To advance molecular multifunctional EPR-based imaging technology and paramagnetic probes. The biocompatible derivatives of multifunctional trityl HOPE probe sensitive to acidity (pH{e}), oxygen (pO{2}) and phosphate (Pi) in Extracellular tissue microenvironment, and dual function nitroxide pH & redox probes will be optimized for concurrent multifunctional imaging using cutting edge imaging modalities, rapid scan EPR imaging and Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. (SA2) To perform molecular imaging of chemical TME as the mammary tumors progress to malignancy. Multifunctional spatially-resolved TME profiling will validate morphological and gene expression-based staging in a mouse model of breast cancer and will map tumor regions with different phenotypes. Tissue samples from the areas with the chemical TME characteristics of a malignant phenotype will be isolated and the TME study will be complemented with immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic tissue analysis, and with measurements of total phosphorus and phosphate (Pi) contents in blood. In summary, the developed multifunctional imaging techniques and probes will broaden the scope of preclinical EPR allowing for mapping of physiologically relevant tissue parameters in various disease models in cancers and beyond. New knowledge on stage-specific TME evolution during tumor progression is required to optimize TME-targeted anticancer therapies. It will also provide a scientific basis to evoke public awareness of high content of the phosphate-based modifiers in the processed food and the potential health risk."

Vesicular- or vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases (V-ATPases) are multi-component, ATP-driven proton
pumps consisting of a V1 complex that possesses ATPase activity and a Vo complex for proton transfer across
the membrane. V-ATPases play important roles in the acidification of intracellular vesicles, organelles, and the
extracellular milieu, and are essential for maintaining the pH homeostasis of endosomes, lysosomes, and the
Golgi apparatus in all eukaryotic cells. V-ATPase deficiency in mammals is embryonic lethal, and malfunction of
V-ATPases is associated with numerous diseases, including microbial infection, renal tubular acidosis,
osteoporosis, sensorineural deafness, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Despite the critical functions of
V-ATPases, we have limited understanding on the biogenesis, assembly, regulation, and signaling of mammalian
V-ATPases. A major challenge in studying mammalian V-ATPases is that the pure complexes are difficult to
obtain for biochemical and biophysical experiments. We developed an innovative method to purify large amounts
of human V-ATPase to homogeneity directly from cells. Our preliminary cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
structures of human V-ATPases show three functional states at up to 3.1 Å resolution and with all known subunits,
which together represent the most complete mechanistic model of V-ATPase to date. Our study revealed that
mammalian V-ATPases are composed of proteins, glycans, glycolipids, and lipids. Therefore, we defined the V-
ATPase as a glycoproteolipid complex. Our study opened up the field for comprehensively understanding the
biogenesis, assembly, regulation, and signaling of V-ATPases. Based on our prior work, we will complement
cryo-EM structure determination with biochemical and functional assays, yeast genetics, and mass spectrometry
analysis to address fundamental questions in the field, including the roles of glycolipids in the V-ATPase
assembly and function, the regulation of V-ATPases by reversible assembly, the detailed mechanism of proton
transfer, and the mechanisms of V-ATPase mediated cell signaling. The completion of this project will not only
provide conceptual innovations regarding the V-ATPases assembly, regulation, and signaling, but also inspire
new therapeutic strategies for treating V-ATPase-related diseases."

BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) is completing a comprehensive cell census of the adult mouse
brain, and BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) will extend this work with emphasis on human and non-
human primates. Effectively organizing, summarizing, accessing, and refining these atlases is critical to
maximizing their impact on science. This proposal is to develop an extensible Brain Cell Knowledge Base
(BCKB) to ingest and standardize comprehensive cell type information from BICAN’s development of a
multimodal, multi-species brain cell atlas and disseminate that atlas as an open and interactive community
resource for advancing knowledge of the brain. The BCKB will be initialized during this project with multi-
dimensional brain cell type classifications from BICCN and will expand as data and knowledge are produced by
BICAN researchers.
Under Aim 1, we will create an adaptive knowledge graph for linking brain cell information. Spatial aggregation
will be done using common coordinate frameworks. A flexible graph-based data model will capture discrete and
continuous cell type relationships. The work will start with cross-species MOp data and comprehensive whole-
brain mouse datasets from BICCN and later extend into BICAN’s whole-brain molecular and spatial
transcriptomics data in human and non-human primates as such data becomes available. Anchoring of
taxonomies in single cell molecular and spatial transcriptomics provides a robust framework for integrating
multimodal data that is spatially mapped and/or cell types mapped. An ecosystem of tools for curating,
annotating, mapping, and visualization of cell type data will be created in Aim 2. We will build and extend tools,
such as the initial Cell Types Cards showcasing BICCN’s MOp results, so BICAN teams and public labs can
share and refine brain cell type taxonomies and anatomical integration. The tools framework developed for this
aim will provide a central hub, akin to an “app store,” to access our tools and others from the community to
interact with cell type data. This connected tools framework will streamline scientific workflows and encourage
FAIR practices. As part of Aim 3, we will develop an infrastructure to link brain cell data and knowledge. This
infrastructure will enable ingesting, storing, searching, and curating neuroscientific information from multiple
sources into a linked information platform. This knowledge infrastructure will help connect disparate pieces of
cell type information using expert annotations, machine-learning inferences, and derivations using provenance
mechanisms. We will use Allen Institute’s Brain Knowledge Platform for initial implementation. Finally, in Aim 4
we will gather, curate, and integrate information and knowledge from BICAN teams by conducting annual hands-

10875581,"Traditional file-based neuroimaging data management and integration strategies have shown
increasing limitations in accommodating the meteoric growth in both the scale and complexity of today’s
neuroimaging data. The sophisticated software and hardware pipelines required in many of today’s
neuroimaging studies have produced numerous platform-specific data files that are increasingly difficult
to parse, exchange, and understand by the broader research community. Modern neuroimaging studies are
hampered by not only the challenge of parsing and managing rigid and diverse file types, but also the lack of a
unified interface for systematic data validation, query, manipulation and integration, thereby limiting its
ability to handle large datasets. Creating a future-proof, highly scalable, and low-maintenance data storage
and dissemination platform is highly desirable for the broad and rapidly growing neuroimaging community. The
future of neuroimaging data management must be scalable, searchable, verifiable, and capable of
accommodating highly complex hierarchical data generated from complex paradigms involving multi-modal
inputs. Inspired by the great success of NoSQL database platforms, we envision that a unified database
interface for managing complex neuroimaging data and exchanging human-readable hierarchical data records
will be highly suitable to address the urgent needs of next-generation neuroimaging data management. In this
project, we aim to solidify a series of easy-to-adopt, easy-to-extend, human-readable JSON (http://json.org)
based data file specifications to systematically assist the storage, exchange and integration of existing and
emerging neuroimaging datasets. These JSON-encoded universal data files readily enable users to utilize
highly scalable and high-performance NoSQL databases, such as CouchDB and MongoDB, to rapidly
disseminate large, NIH-funded neuroimaging public datasets, and enable validation and automation. Our group
has been a major contributor to JSON-based scientific data storage since 2011. We have published open-
source specifications (http://openjdata.org) to standardize the exchange of neuroimaging data for common
formats such as NIfTI/GIfTI/SNIRF, building a solid foundation for application-specific adoptions. In this project,
we seek to further develop, solidify, and disseminate JSON-based data exchange specifications and
NoSQL databases. We have built collaborations to major neuroimaging data analysis stakeholders, such as
FreeSurfer, SPM, FieldTrip, HOMER, BrainStorm. At the end of this project, we will be able to 1) develop a set
of stable universal file formats that greatly modernize data sharing in neuroimaging applications, easing future
maintenance and extension, and 2) provide open-source tools for users to build NoSQL database backends to
facilitate integration and automation of public/private databases, enabling query, validation, and scale-up.
Success in this project will result in a robust data exchange platform to facilitate convenient data sharing,
promote reproducible research, and forge efficient collaborations among a broad neuroimaging community."

Recent evolutions in the field of hemostatic materials have focused on developing products with high hemostatic
efficiency. An ideal hemostatic material should quickly control hemorrhaging, exhibit biocompatibility and
degradability, promote wound healing and be lightweight and inexpensive. Electrospinning degradable
macromolecules like collagen, chitosan, polycaprolactone yields nanofiber which have shown promise in wound
healing and bleeding cessation applications. Modern bleeding cessation treatments should have degradable and
regenerative capabilities but little research has been published on the utilization of synthetic analogs to costly
biomolecules. The long-term goal of this project is to generate a better understanding of polymer-based
hemostatic wound healing materials and cellular responses towards these materials for implementation in
regenerative treatments.
 As a step towards this goal, a degradable collagen strand analog must be synthesized, electrospun, and
compared to other scaffolds for in vitro and in vivo evaluation. It is hypothesized that a biomimetic synthetic
polymer can be electrospun into an affordable, biocompatible, degradable, hemostatic wound dressing material
that will not only catalyze coagulation but also will not require surgical removal.
 This proposal is significant because it represents the first attempt to incorporate a polyester-based
collagen mimic into electrospun scaffolds with the ability to control scaffold composition to combine desired
properties and functionalities in an ideal material for wound healing and hemostatic applications. This approach
is innovative because it will determine the feasibility of utilizing a synthetic collagen mimic in applications such
as electrospun wound healing and bleeding cessation materials. It is anticipated that the collagen-like
functional groups on the novel polyester coupled with the presence of chitosan in the fibers will lead to
bleeding cessation in wound models with suitable degradation rates. Furthermore, undergraduate students will
conduct the majority of the research in this proposal. This will be a significant research experience for these
students and will provide them with valuable laboratory and research skills that will be essential in their
careers."

Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encode complex regulatory instructions in their 3' untranslated
regions (3'UTRs) that prescribe context-dependent control of translation and decay. Disruption
of mRNA post-transcriptional regulation by mutational lesions or shortening of 3'UTRs has been
linked to diverse human diseases. RNA molecules fold back on themselves into base-paired
secondary structures and occasionally higher-order tertiary structures, and sequence-encoded
structures are hypothesized to play key roles in directing 3'UTR regulation. For example, RNA
structures can provide specific binding sites for RNA binding proteins and may tune the
accessibility of microRNA target sites. RNA structures may also function as molecular switches,
with protein or microRNA binding triggering specific 3'UTR structural changes that alter the
activity of distal regulatory sites. However, little remains known about 3'UTR structures and their
role in post-transcriptional regulation. Existing data indicate that 3'UTRs have heterogenous and
dynamic structures, which makes them challenging to study by traditional chemical probing or
biophysical methods. My research group has recently developed a new single-molecule
chemical probing technology (DANCE-MaP) that makes it possible to accurately define RNA
structural ensembles consisting of 2-3 coexisting states in living cells. We will pursue two areas
of research that exploit and build on the DANCE-MaP technology: (1) We will apply DANCE-
MaP to define 3'UTR folding landscapes and mechanisms of combinatorial regulation by RNA
binding proteins and microRNAs. (2) We will develop next-generation technologies that can
resolve structurally heterogenous RNAs with greater resolution and provide model-free, physical
interpretation of chemical probing data. This work will provide an improved understanding of
mRNA regulatory mechanisms, helping advance efforts to therapeutically target 3'UTRs to
modulate gene expression, and contribute new structure determination technologies that will be
of broad utility to the RNA biology field."
10875603,"Ribosome RNA (rRNA) modifying enzymes are important factors in the assembly and function of
ribosomes, dysregulation of which is frequently seen in human hematopoietic disorders. We only have limited
knowledge of the catalytic role of rRNA modifying enzymes in the physiological and pathological processes of
human hematopoiesis, although a few studies characterized the importance of rRNA modifications in these
processes. Preliminary data (CRISPR screening) from my laboratory shows that the ablation of DIMT1 (an 18S
rRNA N26,6A-dimethylation (N26,6A) methyltransferase) significantly impairs cell viability of hematopoietic stem
progenitor cells (HSPCs). DIMT1 is highly expressed in HSPC, and its expression decreases in the differentiated
lineages. However, the molecular function and detailed mechanism of DIMT1 in human hematopoiesis remain
elusive. Even though DIMT1-mediated rRNA modifications are highly conserved, the catalytic activity of
DIMT1 is dispensable for proper ribosome biogenesis. However, our recent results suggest that the catalytic
activity of DIMT1 is required for the viability of HSPCs, while the catalytic-independent role of DIMT1 is important
for 18S rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. This implies that DIMT1 may have a necessary role as a
scaffold in ribosome biogenesis separate from its catalytic activity. Furthermore, we show that the catalytic role
of DIMT1 is indispensable for the expression of genes involved in the Fanconi anemia and other DNA repair
pathways. However, whether and how DIMT1-mediated N26,6A installation in 18S rRNA influences cell viability
and DNA repair pathways in HSPCs are not known. Here, our goal is to understand the molecular function and
the mechanistic details of the catalytic role of DIMT1 in the regulation of cell viability and gene expression in
HSPCs. Specifically, Aim 1 will investigate the catalytic role of DIMT1 as an 18S rRNA methyltransferase in
HSPC cell viability and protein synthesis. Aim 2 will investigate the molecular mechanism by which DIMT1-
mediated N26,6A in 18S rRNA controls translation elongation using an in vitro eukaryotic translation system. Aim
3 will investigate the structure-function relationships and catalytic mechanism of DIMT1. Results from these
studies will provide novel insights into how the catalytic role of DIMT1 impacts HSPC cell viability and the
expression of genes Fanconi anemia and other DNA repair pathways. The understanding we will gain can be
broadly applicable to hematopoietic studies and many other biological disciplines."

Contemporary basic research uses data-intensive approaches to address fundamental questions about
biological phenomena that emerge at the systems level. This application will establish the Systems &
Biomolecular Data Science (SBDS) training program as a hub for cultivating quantitative, computational, and
analytic predoctoral students at the University of Virginia (UVA). The SBDS training program brings together
12 degree-granting programs and 34 faculty mentors across the UVA Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Data
Science, and Arts & Sciences. UVA has a rich history in SBDS, which spans decades of systems physiology
in different cell types and organs, thus ensuring a competitive pool of predoctoral applicants each year. The
co-PIs have complementary expertise in the SBDS field and track records in mentorship and education, career
development of predoctoral students, scientific rigor and transparency, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
The overarching goal of the SBDS training program is to prepare the next generation of transdisciplinary
biomedical scientists at the interface of quantitative biology, systems biology, machine learning, and
informatics. The one-year SBDS curriculum will guide 10 second-year Ph.D. students plus one cost-shared
student through coursework, a discussion series on collaborative foundations, a journal club, a hackathon, and
an 80-hour research immersion in the laboratory of an approved co-mentor who is complementary to the
primary mentor. SBDS alumni remain connected to the training program through a sustained relationship with
their co-mentor and journal-club flexibility for discussions of research in progress and follow-on fellowship
applications. The training program builds upon the strengths of a one-time Big Data to Knowledge training
grant at UVA, which was sponsored by the Office of the Director and coordinated by the National Library of
Medicine. SBDS has robust plans for assessment and dissemination to ensure that the program emulates the
agility and versatility that will characterize its trainees."
10875374,"The purpose of the proposed project is to compare the efficacy of two fully developed physical therapy
interventions in 8-24 months olds with or at high risk of having Cerebral Palsy (CP). Sitting Together And
Reaching To Play (START-Play) targets sitting, reaching and motor-based problem solving in infancy to
improve global development. Usual Care Physical Therapy (UCPT) focuses on advancing motor skills and
preventing impairments. The project builds on a nearly complete clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the
START-Play intervention compared to a non-dose matched comparison group. The proposed study directly
addressed the need for a dose-matched clinical trial to consider the impact of dose of intervention on efficacy.
A direct comparison of START-Play with the dose matched (24 visits in 3 months) UCPT provided in the same
environment (homes) and provided by licensed physical therapists will allow for a direct comparison of the
efficacy of interventions based on two different set of key principles. START-Play is based on developmental
and basic science, motor learning, and neuroplasticity, in addition to our extensive preliminary efficacy data.
START-Play has been fully described with a protocol manual, training documents, and fidelity measures. The
UCPT intervention is based on videotaped session of the comparison group community based intervention
sessions and parent report for the ongoing clinical trial. A fidelity measure used the previous research
quantifies differences in the focus of these interventions and will be used to maintain adherence to both
intervention groups.
 Three sites in different regions of the United States will recruit from local intervention and medical
centers for a total of 150 infants with or at high risk of having cerebral palsy between ages 4-24 months of age,
when they show readiness skills for early sitting and reaching. Risk for CP will be based on the early detection
guidelines and all outcome measures are included in the NIH supported Common Data Elements for Cerebral
Palsy. Each infant will be randomized into a group and will receive the START-Play or the UCPT intervention
for 3 months, with follow up extending for 12 months from baseline.
 The primary objectives examine change over time in sitting gross motor and cognitive development.
Differences in outcomes between the two intervention groups will be examined. In addition, we will begin to
identify predictors of response to developmental motor interventions by evaluating the relationship between
intervention outcomes and 1) infant and family characteristics, 2) presence of white matter, cerebellar, basal
ganglion, or gray matter injury."

 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare fatal cystic lung disease due to bi-allelic inactivating mutations in
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) genes coding for suppressors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1). The origin of LAM cells is still unknown. We profiled a LAM lung compared to an age-
and sex-matched healthy control lung as a hypothesis-generating approach to identify cell subtypes that are
specific to LAM. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals novel mesenchymal and transitional alveolar
epithelial states unique to LAM lung. This analysis identifies a mesenchymal cell hub coordinating the LAM
disease phenotype. Mesenchymal-restricted deletion of Tsc2 in the mouse lung produces a mTORC1-driven
pulmonary phenotype, with a progressive disruption of alveolar structure, a decline in pulmonary function,
increase of WNT ligands, and profound female-specific changes in mesenchymal and epithelial lung cell gene
expression. Genetic inactivation of WNT signaling reverses age-dependent changes of mTORC1-driven lung
phenotype, but WNT activation alone in lung mesenchyme is not sufficient for the development of mouse LAM-
like phenotype. Our study identifies sex- and age-specific gene changes in the mTORC1-activated lung
mesenchyme and establishes the importance of the WNT signaling pathway in the mTORC1-driven lung
phenotype.
 Based on these data, we propose to test our hypothesis that mTORC1 hyperactivation in LAM cells
dysregulates mTORC1-WNT signaling crosstalk which drives cystic airspace enlargement due to chronic
activation of resident mesenchymal and alveolar epithelial cells. Our translational hypothesis states that
dampening hyperactive mTORC1 and WNT signaling to basal physiological levels represents a potential
opportunity to enhance the efficacy of rapalogs and potentially provide novel therapy for LAM patients.
 To test our hypothesis, we will specifically ask in: Aim 1: How does the small subset of LAM cells induce global
pathological changes in the lung centered around lung mesenchymal cell hub? Aim 2: Does activation of
mTORC1-WNT/?-catenin pathways in LAM lung mesenchyme dysregulate alveolar epithelial cell fitness? Aim
3: Will combined therapeutic targeting of the mTORC1-WNT/?-catenin pathways provide new treatment
opportunities for LAM?
 The proposed studies will yield not only essential new insights into the role of TSC2-dependent mTORC1
activation and WNT signaling in LAM but also advance our understanding of how LAM lung mesenchymal cells
orchestrate cystic lung damage. Our translational studies may also provide novel strategies for therapeutic
intervention targeting hyperactive mTORC1 and WNT signaling pathways, which have not been tested for
treatment of LAM."

Background: Voluntary assisted contact tracing (ACT) is an evidence-based approach that efficiently identifies
persons in need of HIV treatment and prevention. Malawi, like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has
adopted ACT policies to support its “95-95-95” targets for HIV testing, treatment, and viral suppression. However,
Malawi’s ACT implementation has been poor due to deficits in health worker capacity and clinical coordination.
Through preliminary work, our team has 1) developed a set of implementation strategies (theory-based health
worker training and continuous quality improvement processes) that address these barriers; 2) packaged these
strategies into a blended learning platform that combines digital and face-to-face modalities; and 3) field-tested
the package in Malawi with promising preliminary results. In this proposal, the package will be rigorously
evaluated in Malawi for implementation, service uptake, and cost-effectiveness outcomes. The overarching
hypothesis is that the blended learning ACT package will be feasible and acceptable to implement, build health
worker and facility ACT capacity, lead to more contacts tested for HIV, and be cost-effective in the Malawian
context. Aims and Methods: Through a two-arm pragmatic cluster randomized implementation trial, the
proposed research will address these gaps through three specific aims. Twenty Malawian facilities in two districts
will be randomized 1:1 to receive the blended learning implementation package (enhanced) versus standard
implementation package (standard) and followed for two years. In the first aim, ACT implementation outcomes
will be compared between the enhanced and standard arms. Health worker fidelity to ACT procedures (primary
outcome) will be assessed through audio-recorded ACT encounters. Secondary outcomes include facility
adoption of the enhanced implementation strategy, as well as health worker feasibility and acceptability. In the
second aim, HIV service uptake outcomes will be compared between the enhanced and standard arms. The
number of indexes offered ACT, number of contacts elicited, number of contacts tested for HIV (primary
outcome), and number of contacts diagnosed as HIV-positive will be compared between the two arms. In the
third aim, cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes will be examined. The primary outcome is the incremental cost
per disability adjusted life year saved. This will be estimated in the trial population and projected nationally.
Team: The team is led by a new and early stage Principal Investigator with ACT expertise. The work is a
collaborative endeavor between academic institutions and a large Malawi-based PEPFAR implementing partner
with guidance from the Malawi Ministry of Health. The team has expertise in HIV implementation, implementation
science, technology-based interventions, qualitative and quantitative research methods, and cost-effectiveness
analysis. Impact: This proposal addresses a significant knowledge gap via an innovative research question
using a well-designed research plan. The findings will offer important insights and innovations into how to bridge

Children with oral clefts are at increased risk for deficits in language and literacy compared to their peers.
However, to date no attention has been given to interventions that might offset these risks. This study will be
the first to develop and test a shared reading intervention to promote language and emergent literacy for young
children with oral clefts. We will tailor the intervention to the needs of this population, ensuring that the program
can be delivered in coordination with regular craniofacial appointments and using innovative remote coaching
strategies to facilitate engagement among families who have traditionally been under-represented in research
(e.g., families living in rural areas). Specifically, in-person sessions will be coordinated with children’s regular
craniofacial care. Between visits, caregivers will use their smartphones to send video recordings of shared
reading interactions for interventionists to review and provide encouragement and coaching. The study will be
conducted in craniofacial clinics at 3 major centers, which serve diverse and complementary patient
populations: Seattle Children’s Hospital, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and Children’s Hospital of Los
Angeles. We will translate and review all materials for cultural and linguistic appropriateness for English and
Spanish-speaking families. In the planning phase (UG3) of the study, we will finalize our treatment and
research protocols (Aim 1). We will recruit a sample of 30 children with oral clefts ages 16 to 20-months old
and their caregivers for an abbreviated pilot test of the intervention. This will allow us to establish intervention
feasibility/acceptability in our target population, and to establish treatment fidelity across centers (Aim 2). This
pilot will also demonstrate whether the intervention engages proposed behavioral targets (i.e., parents’ reading
behaviors) (Aim 3). In the implementation phase (UH3), we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the
intervention with 320 children with oral clefts and their parents. We will enroll participants after palate repair
(ages 16-20 months) and randomize half to receive the intervention and the other half to an information -only
control group. The intervention will consist of 3 in person sessions and 12 remote sessions delivered from
baseline through age 36-months. Aims for the RCT include (1) Test the hypothesis that intervention improves
children’s language and literacy outcomes at age 36 months; (2a) Test the hypothesis that intervention
improves caregivers’ shared reading behaviors and (2b) that improvements in child outcomes are mediated by
changes in caregivers’ shared reading behaviors; and (3) Examine heterogeneity in outcomes based on
demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics. This will be the first study to examine an intervention to
address language and literacy deficits observed in children with oral clefts. In addition to improving care for
children with oral clefts, the strategies used to extend the reach of intervention to rural and geographically
diverse families will have implications for intervention delivery in many other child populations."

Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children. Recent studies have identified
new subtypes of brain tumors, including high-grade glioma with G34R/V mutations in the histone variant
H3.3 (HGG-G34). This subtype primarily affects the cerebral hemispheres of adolescents and young adults.
In addition to the histone mutation, HGG-G34 often exhibits mutations in both ATRX and TP53. However,
the precise pathogenic mechanism of HGG-G34 remains poorly understood. Currently, there are no
established therapeutic approaches tailored to this subtype, and patients continue to face a dismal prognosis.
Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
the development of HGG-G34 and to identify new therapeutic targets. To address these knowledge gaps,
we have developed a new human embryonic stem cell-based model that allows us to introduce various
combinations of mutations into a defined cell population. Using this mode, we have demonstrated that the
three core mutations (H3.3G34R, ATRX, and TP53) specifically transform interneuronal progenitors of the
ventral forebrain, shedding light on the cellular origin of HGG-G34. We also discovered that H3.3G34R and
ATRX mutations cooperatively enhance the expression of DMRTA2, a forebrain-specific transcription factor,
which is crucial for the high proliferation of HGG-G34 cells. Additionally, our data indicate that the majority
of HGG-G34 cells exhibits characteristics of radial glial (RG) cell, a type of neural/glial progenitor cell that
only exists in the developing brain. These findings collectively indicate a dysregulation in developmental
programs in HGG-G34. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis, including
the transcriptional targets of DMRTA2, the exact role of ATRX mutation, and the maintenance of RG-like
state, are still unclear. Additionally, the clinical relevance of RG-like cells in malignant brain tumors has not
been fully studied. In this proposal, we aim to unravel the transcriptional targets of DMRTA2 by employing
ChIP-seq and assess their involvement in tumorigenesis by loss-of-function experiments (Aim 1).
Additionally, we will investigate the interplay between H3.3G34R and ATRX mutations by examining the
impact of ATRX mutation on the expression, function, and distribution of DMRTA2 (Aim 2). Furthermore, we
will examine the maintenance mechanisms and clinical relevance of RG-like cells through mouse xenograft
models and analysis of clinical samples obtained from human patients (Aim 3). Our innovative HGG-G34
model, scientific expertise, and strong local collaborations uniquely position us to achieve these aims. The
outcomes of this project are expected to provide novel insights into the tumor biology of HGG-G34 and serve
as a foundation for our long-term goal of developing personalized treatment and diagnostic approaches for
patients suffering from this devastating disease."
10883154,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In chronic infection and cancer, CD8 T cells differentiate into an epigenetically distinct, dysfunctional lineage
referred to as exhausted T cells. Through use of in vivo genetic screens and genetic mouse models, we have
generated preliminary evidence that epigenetic regulators of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET)
family orchestrate CD8 T cell differentiation and exhaustion during infection. The BET family is composed of
highly druggable chromatin readers BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and germ cell-restricted BRDT. First-generation pan-
BET inhibitors (BETi) have been evaluated clinically for cancers and inflammatory diseases, and have garnered
considerable interest for the treatment of infections. However, BETi clinical trials have, so far, yielded mixed
results. A critical roadblock to improving BETi therapy is the lack of a detailed molecular understanding of the
function of each individual BET protein in the immune system. This proposal seeks to define how BET proteins
intrinsically regulate T cell exhaustion, which is crucial for advancing our fundamental understanding of
epigenetic regulation of T cell differentiation and for optimizing BETi strategies to reprogram exhaustion.
Accordingly, our preliminary data indicate that BET proteins have discrete, non-redundant roles in regulating
CD8 T cell differentiation and stemness in vivo. We have also found that a tailored, finite BETi treatment strategy
may allow for efficient exhaustion reprogramming and optimal T cell function. Here, we will use inducible genetic
depletion strategies to pinpoint the intrinsic role of each BET protein in controlling T cell fate during chronic
infection, and we will investigate whether precisely timed treatment with second-generation BETi targeting
individual BET proteins effectively modulates exhaustion. Last, despite widespread therapeutic interest in
epigenetically reprogramming exhausted cells, epigenetic mechanisms governing T cell exhaustion remain to
be fully elucidated. Based on preliminary findings, we will investigate whether BRD4 promotes exhaustion
through remobilizing to exhaustion-specifying enhancer regions. We hypothesize that BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4
coordinate CD8 T cell differentiation into an exhausted state, and BETi treatment can be optimized to restore
function to exhausted cells during chronic infection. We propose to: Aim 1, determine the role of BRD4 in
controlling the differentiation and stability of exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic infection. Aim 2, define the
role of BRD4 in regulating the function of exhaustion-specific enhancer elements in CD8 T cells. Aim 3, assess
BRD2 and BRD3 as novel regulators of T cell exhaustion and investigate the impact of BET inhibition on CD8 T
cell differentiation during chronic infection. Resolving the roles of BET proteins in exhaustion has broad
implications for understanding fundamental epigenetic control of T cell differentiation, the immunological
consequences of BETi, and may reveal strategies for genetic or pharmacological reprogramming of exhaustion."

 The initiating genetic alterations leading to blood malignancy occur as early as during fetal development.
This is also true in children with Down syndrome (trisomy 21, T21), who have a significantly increased risk of
developing preleukemia and leukemia during early childhood. The vision of our project is to identify and
characterize fundamental mechanisms that contribute towards the initiation of preleukemia in Down syndrome
children and to establish early therapeutic interventions.
 Children with Down syndrome have a 150-fold increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia during
childhood compared to children without Down syndrome. In 30% of newborns with Down syndrome, a transient
abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) occurs, which is characterized by a clonal proliferation of immature
megakaryoblasts that carry somatic mutations in the transcription factor GATA1. The preleukemic state resolves
spontaneously in most newborns but can lead to liver fibrosis and in some cases liver failure. Recently, we
utilized CRISPR/Cas9 editing in human primary fetal liver derived T21 and disomic hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) to generate an in vivo model of Down syndrome preleukemia and identified the cellular origin of TAM.
However, it remains unclear how an extra copy of chromosome 21 predisposes HSCs to blood malignancy, why
somatic mutations are acquired with high frequency and what factors cooperate with GATA1 to initiate TAM.
Because the liver is the primary site of hematopoiesis during fetal development, we hypothesize that a
combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to T21 and the fetal liver microenvironment contributes to
the higher susceptibility towards preleukemia development.
 The overall objective of our project is to define specific mechanisms that explain the underlying
predisposition of T21 fetal liver HSCs towards initiating preleukemia. In Aim 1, we are proposing to characterize
intrinsic factors in T21 HSCs from fetal liver through mapping the gene expression and mutational burden at
single cell resolution. We will assess transcriptional differences in the development and lineages of T21 HSCs
compared to disomic fetal liver. In addition, we will quantify the rate of somatic mutations in each subpopulation.
In Aim 2, we plan to characterize extrinsic factors in the T21 fetal liver microenvironment through transcriptional
and spatial profiling of the fetal liver. We will carry out functional studies to assess the interaction of stromal
components with T21 HSCs. Finally, in Aim 3, we are proposing to functionally evaluate the roles of candidate
pathways in preleukemia initiation using our previously established model and primary TAM patient samples.
Our goal is to identify and characterize therapeutic targets for preleukemia and associated liver fibrosis.
 The proposed research has the potential to change our basic understanding of why Down syndrome
children are susceptible to preleukemia and our results could provide a strong rational for subsequent translation
into the clinic."

Longitudinal studies have shown that individuals at high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes (T1D) progress through
several distinct stages prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Although the factors causally involved in the rate
of progression are poorly understood, the presence of islet autoantibodies (AAb) is currently the best biomarker
for the future onset of hyperglycemia in T1D. In particular, the single AAb+ stage (generally against glutamic
acid decarboxylase (GADA+)) represents a key window for intervention to delay or prevent progression to T1D.
Our recent study on pancreatic islets isolated from GADA+ donors revealed early α-cell dysfunction while β-cell
mass and function are still normal. Specifically, GADA+ donor islets with normal glucose stimulated insulin
secretion have already demonstrable defects in glucose suppression of glucagon secretion (GSGS). This defect
of GADA+ donors is even more severe in T1D donor islets indicating progressive loss of GSGS. Our previous
study showed that this α-cell dysfunction could be related to elevated cAMP signaling and/or decreased glucose
metabolism. Specifically, transcriptomic analysis identified key genes as downregulated in GADA+ donors:
Protein Kinase Inhibitor Beta (PKIB, a potent PKA inhibitor), glucokinase (GCK), and genes encoding subunits
of mitochondrial complex I. Based on these data, we propose here to test the hypothesis that decreased GSGS
during the progression of T1D is causally related to altered cAMP signaling and/or dysregulated bioenergetics
in α-cells. We have devised two Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will position the cAMP signaling defect
by direct measurements of cAMP in human islets; modification of intracellular cAMP levels using general and
PKA- and EPAC-specific analogues; selective reduction of PKIB expression in α-cells; and assessment of
electrophysiological changes due to cAMP modulation. In Aim 2 we will explore the role of bioenergetics by
evaluation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in intact donor islets and assessment of changes in GSGS
due to drug-induced modulation of GCK and complex I activity. The proposed experiments will elucidate
mechanisms underlying the specific defects in α-cell function during the progression of T1D."

Pyelonephritis continues to result in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care expense. To develop new
treatment strategies, a more thorough understanding of the kidney’s innate defense is needed.
Our research has identified a murine intercalated cell deficiency model that is susceptible to pyelonephritis. We
have also demonstrated that human and murine intercalated cells produce and secrete antimicrobial peptides.
Others have demonstrated that intercalated cells act as the first site in the kidney that responds to Gram-negative
organisms via pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways. Thus, surmounting evidence suggests that
intercalated cells perform a critical role in the innate defense of the kidney.
In this proposal, our research team builds on our findings from our recent Nature Communications manuscript
and a prior R01 intercalated cell (IC)-focused grant. We have previously demonstrated that innate immune gene
expression is enriched in intercalated cells and alterations of intercalated cells lead to increased urinary tract
infection (UTI) susceptibility. Next, we performed single cell mRNA sequencing and biological pathway analysis
on human kidneys following stimulation with uropathogenic E. coli. “Phagosome maturation” was a key
intercalated cell pathway, particularly after exposure to bacteria that cause UTIs. More recently, we have
developed preliminary data that demonstrates that IC phagocytosis is dependent on Signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling.
We hypothesize that intercalated cells Stat3 related phagocytic functions are activated via Toll like receptor 4
(Tlr4) and Janus kinase (Jak1) signal transducers and subsequently control acid secretion into the cellular
compartments that contain internalize bacteria (phagosomes). To build on our previous studies, we have devised
three specific aims that will thematically examine the role of intercalated cells in innate defense of the kidney.
We know that intercalated cells can phagocytose bacteria. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the extent that
the Stat3 IC signaling pathway is dependent on upstream Tlr4 and or Jak1. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine
the extent that Stat3 regulates kidney control of phagosome pH. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will look at the
functional consequences of increasing Stat3 activation on the IC phagocytosis and the kidney burden during
experimental pyelonephritis.
Our long-term research goal is to develop new pyelonephritis treatment strategies that reduce antibiotic exposure
and preserve kidney function in populations at risk. This research will provide the foundation to include
modulation of intercalated cells in pyelonephritis management, thereby expanding treatment scope beyond
antibiotics."

Measurement-based care (MBC) is considered an evidence-based practice. However, low MBC fidelity (the
extent to which MBC practices are delivered) in community mental health centers (CMHCs) undermines
effectiveness. To optimize MBC effectiveness, theory-informed fidelity research is needed to identify influential
MBC practice(s) that engage target mechanisms and predict youth clinical outcomes. The proposed project will
achieve this goal via three primary aims: (1) Define and evaluate the entire continuum of MBC fidelity domains;
(2) Assess the impact of MBC fidelity on target mechanisms and youth clinical outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the
utility of pragmatic MBC fidelity indicators (i.e., self-report and digital usage data). This project will utilize
existing data from the Community Study of Outcome Monitoring for Emotional Disorders in Teens (COMET), a
randomized effectiveness trial comparing two MBC conditions [MBC+TAU (treatment as usual) and MBC+EBT
(Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents, UP-A)] to TAU.
COMET allows rigorous assessment of the entire continuum of MBC practice domains, client-level
mechanisms of MBC, and youth clinical outcomes. The COMET sample includes 82 clinicians and 177 youth
treated in CMHCs in Florida and Connecticut. To achieve study aims, a multi-method (digital MBC system
usage data, self-report, observer-report) and multi-informant (clinician, observer) measurement approach will
be used to rigorously assemble and evaluate the entire continuum of MBC fidelity practice domains. Item
Response Theory (IRT) measurement models will evaluate dimensionality, reliability, validity, and item fit for all
MBC fidelity indicators. Additional models will target MBC-specific data features (for individual fidelity indicators
and overall fidelity scores), including variability and reliability across sessions, youth, clinicians, clinics, and
data sources. We will then evaluate the impact of MBC fidelity (scores and indicators) on target mechanisms
(youth/caregiver alliance, youth/caregiver engagement, and UP-A mechanisms) and youth clinical outcomes
(youth, caregiver, independent-evaluator ratings of symptoms, improvement, and global functioning). Finally, a
subset of pragmatic fidelity indicators (i.e., digital usage data, self-report) will be evaluated as proxy measures
of MBC fidelity. Our long-term goal, consistent with NIMH Strategic Goal 4, is to optimize MBC effectiveness
and thus improve youth clinical outcomes. Next, we will create implementation strategies to improve MBC
fidelity and test them through a Type 1 Effectiveness Implementation Hybrid funded by an NIMH R34. This R01
is a critical building block in our effort to realize the promise and optimize the effectiveness of MBC."

 Cystic Fibrosis (CF) has been a pediatric disease, but with improved treatment and care it has
become a chronic disease extending the life expectancy of patients. The characteristic chronic
pro-inflammatory process in CF accelerates cellular senescence and further complicates this
disease. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to combat cellular senescence in the
CF lung. Cellular senescence is a key process underlying aging, which leads to an accumulation
of epigenetic noise. Such noise distorts the epigenetic landscape and dysregulates gene
expression, resulting in declined tissue function and age-related diseases. We and others have
established that epigenetics are involved in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. We have
shown that anti-aging methods improve mucociliary clearance in the CF bronchial epithelium.
Cellular senescence is regulated via gene transcription through the interplay between promoters,
enhancers, and cis-acting regulatory elements bound by transcription factors. Bromodomain-
containing protein 4 (Brd4) is an epigenetic reader protein. It binds to acetylated histone and
recruits transcriptional factors for actively transcribed genes. Transcription factor AP-1 was
recently reported to mark the senescence enhancer landscape and drive the transcriptional
program in senescent cells. Brd4 is critical for many senescence-associated secretory phenotype
related inflammatory gene expression profiles. However, the role of Brd4 and its interactions with
AP-1 to control the senescent related gene expression in the CF bronchial epithelium has not
been explored. Our preliminary data showed that blocking Brd4 down-regulated multiple
senescent genes, and reduced the recruitment of AP-1 to those genes. We hypothesize that
blocking Brd4 in the CF bronchial epithelium will epigenetically reduce cellular senescence in the
CF lung ultimately preserving lung function. To test our hypothesis, we will first determine if Brd4
regulates the chromatin accessibility and is required for senescent-related gene expression in the
CF bronchial epithelium; we will also explore the underlying mechanisms and the interactions of
Brd4 and AP-1 in regulating senescent related gene expression; lastly, we will determine the
efficacy of Brd4 inhibition in CFTR responsive and unresponsive CF rat models. Results from this
study will offer new insights of epigenetic regulation in the CF bronchial epithelium and provide
support for targeting senescent airway cells in CF lung disease as a novel therapeutic strategy."

Maintaining genome integrity is paramount for all cells, yet the essential cellular process of gene transcription
introduces myriad opportunities for cells to incur damage to their genome. For example, transcription can lead
to the formation of R-loops, three-stranded structures that contain an RNA-DNA hybrid and a region of single-
stranded DNA. R-loops occur throughout the genome of mammalian cells and regulate various aspects of
gene expression. They are typically dynamic, but some sequences and cellular perturbations can lead to stable
R-loops that can stall transcription, block DNA replication, or cause DNA breaks via incompletely understood
mechanisms. Moreover, some of these R-loops can be excised from the genome and accumulate in the cyto-
plasm, where they can trigger innate immune responses and even cell death. Thus, cells carefully regulate R-
loop formation and turnover.
 The long-term goal of this research program is to understand how cells identify deleterious R-loops (as dis-
tinct from regulatory ones), how problematic R-loops are removed from the genome, and how these functions
are disrupted in human diseases. Data suggest that stabilized R-loops become susceptible to processing (i.e.,
excision from the genome, followed by gap repair) when less mutagenic pathways such as unwinding of the
RNA-DNA hybrid or degradation of the RNA component on the chromosome are unavailable or too slow. The
objective of this application is to identify the pathway(s) that excises problematic R-loops from the genome and
to define the sites and sequence characteristics of problematic R-loops.
 Aim 1 will investigate which DNA repair factors are involved in R-loop processing and determine how the
nucleases that process these structures are recruited to the sites where R-loops are excised. Studies are also
proposed to determine whether R-loop excision leaves a single-stranded gap in the DNA, to define the sites of
nuclease processing and gap formation, and to identify the polymerases responsible for repairing these gaps.
Aim 2 will characterize the genomic and sequence features of problematic R-loops and develop a novel, modu-
lar experimental system to directly test hypotheses about the determinants of R-loop processing. These stud-
ies will take advantage of new cell biological methods that have been developed to study R-loop processing
and cutting-edge genomic approaches developed to map the spatial distribution of R-loops and R-loop pro-
cessing products throughout the genome.
 Elucidating the features of problematic R-loops and how the cell copes with them has the potential to illumi-
nate our understanding of how cells maintain genome stability and how this may go awry in cancer and other
diseases states. This will lay a strong foundation for strategies to manipulate R-loop processing for therapeutic
ends."

For a quarter of a century, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has continued to
assemble a cohort of over 11,000 persons with stroke in a biethnic Texas community to study health equity and
the social determinants of stroke and stroke outcomes. This population-based project focuses on Mexican
American persons, the largest sub-group of Latinx, the United States’ largest minority population. In the newest
cycle, BASIC will continue to monitor trends and ethnic disparities in stroke incidence, recurrence, 90-day
outcomes (neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life) and all-cause mortality. Because of previous
work suggesting a rising incidence in those 45-59 years of age, for the first time, BASIC will expand stroke
surveillance and outcome assessments to include those 35-44 years of age, where preliminary data suggests
that there is considerable stroke burden. Novel and innovative for this cycle of BASIC is a new mixed methods
focus on risk and resilience mechanisms among Mexican American stroke survivors to determine factors that
lead to better stroke outcome. Utilizing a modified Reserve Capacity Model, we will investigate barriers and
facilitators to favorable stroke outcomes and utilization of post-stroke healthcare among Mexican American
stroke survivors. The Reserve Capacity Model is a framework to examine the role of psychosocial factors in
health and health disparities including sociocultural and other resilience factors (e.g., reserve capacity
resources) that may be associated with better health outcomes. We will adapt this model to the stroke context
and to the unique cultural features of the Mexican American study community. This will be paired with a
rigorous qualitative investigation of available resources and unmet needs for favorable stroke outcomes among
Mexican American stroke survivors, including those 35-44 years of age. The previous cycle of BASIC saw the
beginning of an exciting linkage of our population-based study with administrative data creating a unique “big
data” resource. We now propose an innovative expansion of this effort and for the first time in addition to
Medicare data, we will link BASIC data to Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid data. These
data linkages will be used to identify barriers and facilitators to post-stroke healthcare utilization, including
emergency department visits, readmissions, use of long-term care, primary care visits, mental health visits and
use of inpatient rehabilitation. Together, this next BASIC cycle will continue to monitor emerging stroke trends
and ethnic disparities while exploring several new avenues directed at uncovering specific targets to improve
Mexican American stroke health equity."

10884889,"Summary/Abstract
Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms poses a grave threat to human health and
has enormous economic consequences worldwide. Fungal pathogens present a particular challenge because
they are eukaryotes and share many of the same biological processes as the human hosts they infect. Among
the most problematic fungal pathogens are species of Cryptococcus, which cause over 180,000 deaths per year
across the globe. Cryptococcal meningitis, the major clinical manifestation of the disease, has a 100% mortality
rate if left untreated. Even with best available therapies, mortality rates remain high because the number of drug
classes that have distinct targets in fungi is very limited and the usefulness of current antifungal drugs is
compromised by either dose-limiting host toxicity or the frequent emergence of high-grade resistance. New, non-
cross-reactive targets for therapeutic intervention are urgently needed.
In work performed with prior support from NIAID, we have shown that targeting the molecular chaperone Hsp90
in Cryptococcus and other fungi provides a powerful strategy to enhance the efficacy of antifungal drugs and
abrogate drug resistance. The “druggability” of Hsp90 has been well established by many small molecules
targeting this protein for the treatment of human cancers. The poor antifungal activity and toxicity of currently
available drugs, however, demand development of fungal-selective inhibitors as proposed in this revised
resubmission.
To pursue the goal of fungal selectivity, our interdisciplinary team has now solved the structure of the drug-
binding domain of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans Hsp90, both in unbound and inhibitor-bound
states. These chemo-structural studies identified fungal-specific differences in conformational flexibility that
allowed us to design, synthesize and characterize fungal-selective inhibitors of a new chemical class. Now,
leveraging the new chemistry and structure-based design approaches we developed with previous funding, we
will use our complementary expertise in fungal chemical and molecular biology (Cowen) and medicinal chemistry
(Brown) to continue pursuing structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, but now augmented by newly
developed computational algorithms to generate inhibitors with broad-spectrum antifungal activity. The efficacy
of compounds alone and in combination with a standard antifungal will be tested in culture and in mice against
drug-resistant C. albicans and C. neoformans. In addition to generating important basic insights, our results are
likely to impact the treatment of invasive fungal infections in the near future by providing promising leads for
development of actual antifungal drug candidates that operate in a new way."
10881292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 40% of ARDS patients lose their battle with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Many
of these patients succumb because ongoing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) overwhelms the innate
capacity of the lung to repair itself. On the other hand, many ARDS patients go on to recover, which
means that their reparative capacities eventually prevail. Since there are currently no medical therapies
for ARDS, minimizing its mortality amounts to achieving an optimal balance between spontaneous
tissue repair versus the generation of VILI. However, one-size-fits-all strategies for managing ARDS
have had limited success in reducing mortality, and the heterogeneity of ARDS is such that empirical
searches are very unlikely to lead to optimal ventilation strategies. Progress must thus be based on a
fundamental understanding of VILI mechanisms, so understanding the balance between injury and
repair in VILI remains a pressing unmet medical need. We have shown in vivo that the timing of the
ventilatory cycle is critically important to the prevention of cyclic airway recruitment and derecruitment
(RD) that leads to VILI. Furthermore, we have shown in vitro that, following onset of RD, the physical
integrity of an epithelial monolayer remains normal for a period of time before decreasing quasi-
exponentially, which is reminiscent of cancer survival curves governed by multi-hit mechanisms.
Accordingly, our overarching hypothesis is that the progression of VILI involves a multi-hit
mechanism leading to dysfunction of the blood-gas barrier, and that eventual recovery from
VILI is determined by whether the mechanical ventilation regimen being applied allows barrier
dysfunction to be counteracted by barrier healing. The overall goal of our research is to determine
in detail how both the progression and resolution of VILI are influenced by the current status of lung
injury and by the relative contributions of RD versus tissue over-distension and identify modes of
ventilation that can adapt successfully to a patient's own pathophysiology. Analysis of experimental
findings will be incorporated into a computational model to develop biopredictors that can forecast
whether injury or recovery will prevail in a given situation based on physiologic measurements at the
bedside. We will achieve this goal by measuring how barrier function in epithelial cell monolayers either
degrades or improves following application of controlled levels of atelectrauma, and by determining
how lung injury in pig models of ARDS either further develops or resolves with different mechanical
ventilation strategies that vary in their degrees of injuriousness. Computational modeling informed by
the experiment results will be used to explore energy dissipation within the respiratory cycle as a
biopredictor of patient outcome. By taking this approach, we expect to advance the design of optimal
ventilation strategies for ARDS that are adaptive and personalized to a given patient."
10884401,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), retention of HIV-infection people in antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an increasing
challenge. With only 67% retained on ART in SSA, over 7.5 million people are out of care, threatening both
individual health and HIV epidemic control. With significant healthcare system constraints and formidable
healthcare worker (HCW) shortages, ART services in SSA struggle to meet ambitious global targets of 90%
retained in care. In research settings, text-based mHealth innovations show promise to increase ART retention
and, therefore, reduce viral load (VL). However, few mHealth innovations have been tested or proven effective
in real-world settings with severe human and financial resource constraints. mHealth innovations that
successfully retain more patients on ART, at lower cost, within large-volume public ART clinics in SSA are
urgently needed. Lighthouse Trust (LT), the largest public provider of ART in Malawi, operates two large clinics
in Lilongwe with the Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH), Lighthouse Clinic (LH) and Martin Preuss Center (MPC),
with a combined 35,000 ART patients. 12-month retention at Lighthouse is 67%, below the 90% global target for
epidemic control. Both clinics employ a real-time electronic medical records system (EMRS) and implement a
resource-intensive patient retention program, Back to Care (B2C). B2C aims to trace patients who miss ART
visits by >14 days. MPC has over 7800 monthly ART visits, and more than 10% of clients are B2C-eligible. B2C
demand, coupled with HCW constraints, results in tracing of only 33% of target clients. Lack of, or delayed,
tracing reduces ART retention. Moreover, over 50% of traced B2C clients are found on ART, 60% of whom had
transferred, demonstrating significant unnecessary tracing. Poor data quality reduces B2C effectiveness.
Therefore, the University of Washington’s International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) and
LT, with support from MoH and Medic Mobile, seek to implement an innovative, proactive, patient retention
system using two-way texting (2wT) between new ART patients and staff. 2wT will resolve potential retention
issues before they occur and improve data quality (e.g. identifying transfers), reducing B2C workload. Using a
quasi-experimental, pre-post design, this R21 (Aim 1) will test a hybrid 2wT intervention to provide adherence
support for, and visit-focused communication with, new ART initiates at MPC clinic, comparing retention (ART
outcomes, visit adherence, VL) and B2C referrals among two groups of new MPC ART clients: 2wT-supported
(prospective intervention) and matched pre-2wT (retrospective comparison). After demonstrating improved
retention at lower cost (Aim 2) using research teams (R21: years 1-2), 2wT integration into the EMRS (R33:
years 3-5) will automate enrollment and management of 2WT for new clients in both LH and MPC using routine
HCWs (Aim 3), assessing the transition of research to practice. The proposed mHealth study will significantly
increase ART retention in public ART clinics using routine HCWs, reducing workload and costs. This innovative
approach in high-volume, public settings in Malawi sets the stage for national or regional scale-up."

 More than 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, an HPV-associated malignancy, annually in
the U.S. There are two major histologic forms of cervix cancer: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
adenocarcinoma (ADENO). Importantly, SCC can be prevented through cervical cytology screening
programs, whereas ADENO cannot. While there is a prophylactic vaccine against HPV, uptake of HPV
vaccination in the U.S. has been poor and there are several generations of women who are already exposed
to HPV infection and will not be helped by HPV vaccination. Therefore, cervical screening at a cost of over $6
billion per year will be needed for several decades at least. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of
ADENO has important public health value in order to facilitate the prevention of ADENO, for which current
screening strategies are inadequate. In the US and Europe, HPV16, 18, and 45 infections account for >95%
of AIS/ADENO. We examined viral methylation of HPV16/18/45 AIS (n=27) and cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) (n=63) cases compared to 90 HPV16/18/45 control infections with <CIN2, and found
AUC's of 0.99 and 0.82 for HPV16, respectively. In addition, we have preliminary data showing that
methylation levels of a host gene panel is significantly higher in AIS lesions (p<0.001) compared to controls
(<CIN2). Furthermore, we have employed an HPV-DNA capture NGS assay to prospectively evaluate viral
integration and found a specific HPV18 viral integration that is maintained for the entirety of the screening. We
further found that this integration site has a progressive increase in HPV-integration reads leading up to, and
with a dramatic spike in coverage directly preceding, the histological identification of an incident CIN3 lesion.
The NGS detected integration likely represents an expanding malignant cell clone and shows strong potential
for clinical application.
 We propose to investigate the natural history of HPV and ADENO precursors (i.e., samples prior to the
diagnosis of ADENO and from AIS) with the goal of defining molecular precursors of ADENO, which could be
amenable to immediate treatment and thus prevent ADENO. We will leverage cohorts with large numbers of
HPV16, 18, and 45-positive women (n > 20,000) in whom the vast majority of ADENO occur, to measure host
and HPV viral methylation changes and HPV viral integration to molecularly define the natural history of
ADENO. We will compare and contrast these findings with the better known natural history of SCC. Ultimately,
we will develop a risk-prediction model for AIS/ADENO precursors using HPV genotypes, HPV viral and host
gene epigenetics, and HPV viral integration."

The NBER Training Program in Aging and Health Economics, established in 1989 as part of NBER's Aging
Program, has trained and supported more than 150 early-career investigators as pre- and post-doctoral
fellows. Many former trainees are now leading scholars in health economics, most continue to focus their
research agenda on aging and health issues, and a sizable number are key investigators on actively funded
NIA grants. This application proposes a five-year continuation of the T32 program, with funds requested for
eight pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral fellows per year.
The training program is administered as part of a larger programmatic umbrella that encompasses thirty NIA-
funded research projects on aging and health issues, at least a dozen NIA-funded pilot projects, and a
coordinating infrastructure of administrative, data management, networking and dissemination support. The ten
program fellows who participate each year will conduct their training on-site at the NBER offices in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where they interact regularly with each other and with the many senior faculty affiliates
present. Topics for trainee research often align with the major themes of NBER's programs on aging and
health care, including: health trends and inequalities; the dynamics of the health care ecosystem; medical
innovation and the value of health care; data analytics, information technology and health care decision-
making; the economics of dementia and caregiving; and behavioral interventions to improve health.
Independent research in aging and health is the core activity of NBER's training, in an environment where
there is extensive interaction with senior scholars, structured through the formal mentoring of faculty advisors.
Seminars and workshops are integral to the experience. Notably, all fellows participate in the NBER Trainee
Seminar in Aging and Health, which offers a consistent structure and shared focus for the group as a whole.
The continuation of the NBER Training Program in Aging and Health Economics will provide a strong research
background to a new generation of emerging scholars in economics, most of whom will use their fellowship
research as the foundation of a long-term research agenda on issues in aging and health."
10884511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Enteric neurons (ENs) are required to control gastrointestinal (GI) motility by regulating neurotransmission. Loss
of ENs has been demonstrated in digestive diseases in adults and during aging. In the muscularis propria of the
GI tract, diverse populations of macrophages, called muscularis macrophages (MMs), are linked to the normal
development and maintenance of ENs. While we have shown that MMs closely interact with ENs, the molecules
that may regulate MMs-ENs functional interactions are unknown. Thus, to use MMs as a target for regulating
ENs in digestive diseases, we first need to characterize MMs’ phenotype in humans and identify the mechanisms
regulating MMs-ENs interaction. Our long-term goal is to determine the signaling pathways regulating MMs-ENs
functional interaction and use this knowledge to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat digestive diseases.
In preliminary data generated for this application, we discovered (1) a new population of human MMs closely
associated with nerve fibers. (2) Depletion of this newly discovered MMs population from human organotypic
cultures of small intestine muscularis propria reduces nerve fibers. (3) RNAs from tissues of patients with slow
transit constipation (STC) have reduced expression of Complement 1qa (C1qa), one of the genes enriched in
the newly discovered population of MMs. (4) C1qa, one of the genes enriched in the newly discovered human
MMs population, is exclusively expressed by MMs in mice. (5) Depleting C1qa from MMs reduces synaptic
marker expression, alters GI contractility, and reduces whole gut transit time. (6) Conditional depletion of CSF1
from ENs in a transgenic mouse model induces loss of the newly discovered population of MMs, ENs and
reduces whole gut transit time. Thus, the central hypothesis of this application is that C1qa expressing MMs
regulate GI neurotransmission, and their phenotype depends on CSF1 released from closely associated
ENs. In SA1, we plan to characterize this newly discovered MMs population in STC patients and assess its
contribution to GI contractility using human organotypic cultures. In SA2, we plan to study the contribution of this
novel population of MMs to neurotransmission. In SA3, we propose to study the role of EN-released CSF1 on
circulating monocytes’ recruitment and differentiation into the novel population of MMs. In the long term, we
expect these studies will contribute substantially to creating the basis for targeting MMs as a novel therapeutic
approach to regulate ENs in digestive diseases, such as STC, characterized by loss of ENs."

The adult human brain is comprised of numerous cell types exhibiting specific transcriptomic and epigenomic
signatures associated with their spatial location, connectivity, and function. Although systematic efforts are
underway to characterize cell types in the adult human brain, the transitional cell types and cell states in
developing human brains are not fully defined. Our project will use epigenomic and three-dimensional (3D)
chromosomal architectural information to classify developmental cell types and identify key regulatory dynamics
that may underlie cellular lineage commitment and maturation. Single-cell DNA methylation and chromatin
accessibility profiles have been successfully used to de novo identify distinct cell types in developing and adult
brains. The single-nucleus joint profiling of DNA methylation and chromatin conformation by sn-m3C-seq
provides unique information to identify enhancer-gene looping and provides a resource to link genetic variants
associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to genes. Cell types identified with epigenomic information will be
integrated with spatial transcriptomic signatures using our innovative single-cell joint profiling method of
transcriptome and DNA methylation snmCT-seq. We will determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of
developing brain cell types using multiplexed RNA in situ and Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) assays. We will
apply state-of-the-art approaches to integrate multiple data modalities to identify progenitor and transitional cell
types, lineage-specific regulatory elements, and enhancer-gene 3D interactions. We will construct cell-type-
specific predictive models of cellular trajectory and gene regulation during brain development by integrating
transcription factor-gene interaction information with time- and pseudotime-series genomics data. The cell type
and regulatory elements catalog of human brain development generated by our project will aid the identification
of developing brain cell types involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and regulatory regions susceptible to
perturbation by disease-associated variants."
10880924,"This proposal seeks acquisition of shared-use multi-functional, high-frequency specimen grinder, Planetary Ball
Mill model PM200 with cell disruptor capability, for research in biomedical field. Biomedical research often needs
utilization of mechanical forces to promote reactions, process plant materials, or disrupt cells. Many methods of
processing raw plant materials and cell disruption are time consuming and use chemical compounds which
contaminate specimens. In contrast, the proposed instrument offers very efficient, time-effective, chemicals-free
specimen grinding and cell lysis. The proposed instrument and its accessories feature the most advanced, state-
of-the-art technology of size reduction, sample disruption and mixing by utilizing the Coriolis forces, the complex
interactions between frictional and impact forces. As a result, an extremely high degree of specimen size
reduction is achieved in a very short time, with final crystal sizes below one micrometer.
 The broad, long-term objectives of the research with the proposed instrument cover the current and future
biomedical research needs of the Department of Chemistry and Department of Biology at Morgan State
University (MSU). The three main research avenues where this instrumentation will be very useful are: a)
mechano-chemical synthesis of formulations for delayed release of synthetic antimetabolite drugs; b) extraction
of phytochemicals with anti-cancer properties from plant material; c) disruption of cells for biochemistry and cell
biology research. This instrumentation proposal will outfit Morgan State University with a state-of-the-art, multi-
functional, universal shared-use scientific equipment, which will be highly beneficial to faculty and students
pursuing biomedical research in areas of interest to NIH.
 One of the most important aspects of MSU, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), is the training
of students in advanced areas of biomedical research. This instrument will support the operation of current and
future major university- and school-wide programs in biomedical research and will contribute to building the
research capacity of this institution. This instrumentation will significantly help in current efforts to achieve the
major goal of MSU of obtaining a Carnegie R1 “very high research” classification in the next 10 years. Acquisition
of this instrument will significantly benefit research by many faculty groups in STEM departments, enhance the
capacity of MSU as an HBCU to participate in NIH funded research, and allow new collaborations.
 In summary, this shared-use multi-functional, high-frequency universal mechanical specimen grinder with
cell disruptor capability will significantly help STEM departments of MSU conduct biomedical research and
publish papers, initiate and conduct collaborations with on- and off-campus users, educate students through
biomedical research, and seek NIH funding."
10881349,"With the climate change-related emergence of new pathogens and the reemergence of old, once-controlled
pathogens, as well as in light of rapidly developing antibiotic resistance, society is in urgent need of a more
thorough understanding of the bacterial pathogenicity and its major mediators – toxins and toxic effector proteins
(effectors). The actin cytoskeleton is a common target for numerous bacterial effectors. However, the
mechanisms by which many actin-targeting bacterial toxins exhibit their pathogenicity remain poorly understood.
The long-term goal of the proposal is to decipher the in-depth molecular and cellular mechanisms of bacterial
effectors targeting the actin cytoskeleton to i) enable alternative ways of targeting pathogens and ii) get a deeper
understanding of the actin cytoskeleton per se. The current proposal is directly relevant to the NIH mission as it
focuses on three families of bacterial effectors, all produced by human pathogens. Furthermore, the proposal is
of interest for a general understanding of human physiology as each of the above toxins reveals novel properties
of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, Aim 1 focuses on deciphering the novel hitherto unprecedented ability of VopF
and VopL effectors produced by Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus to potentiate actin processive
polymerization at the pointed ends. Aim 2 addresses the properties of SipA, an effector from Salmonella enterica
that exerts a novel mode of binding to actin, bestowing the pathogen an ability to adhere to and invade the
polarized host cell. In Aim 3, the proposal will decipher the mechanisms of actin-dependent membrane
remodeling by Legionella pneumophila effectors. Understanding these and related processes is particularly
important given that all intracellular pathogens depend heavily on hijacking host membrane organization to
survive and thrive inside the affected cell. The research strategy for the toxin characterization will be based on
using several highly complementary experimental approaches. The effects of the toxins on actin dynamics in
bulk and at the single-filament level will be combined with cell biology and structural biology approaches.
Specifically, bulk actin dynamics will be monitored via modifications of the pyrene-actin polymerization approach.
The effects of the toxins on the actin dynamics at the single-filament level will be characterized by total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy, which will be enforced by microfluidics (in collaboration with Dr. Shekhar) for
deciphering the mechanisms employed by VopF/VopL toxins (Aim 1). A modification of this technique will be
used to decipher the mechanisms of a membrane-reorganizing protein MavH (Aim 3). The structures of VopF
with the actin pointed end (Aim1), and SipA bound along the filament side (Aim 2) will be characterized by the
cryoEM reconstruction in collaboration with Dr. Egelman’s group. Fluorescence anisotropy will be used to
describe the strengths of the interactions between actin and the effectors. The proposed study is significant and
innovative as it fills major gaps in our understanding of the toxicity of several life-threatening pathogens and
reveals novel ways of operation of the actin cytoskeleton."
10881415,"ABSTRACT
Red blood cell transfusion remains a life-saving therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). A major
problem is the high rate of alloimmunization (antibody formation against transfused red cells) that occurs in
transfused patients with SCD. Alloimmunization leads to delays in care, increases costs, and makes transfusion
therapy unsafe and impossible for some patients. The most common antibodies formed by patients with SCD
are directed against the Rh blood group system. Studies performed by our group and others demonstrate RH
genetic variants in patients with SCD and Black donors is a major risk factor leading to the high incidence of Rh
alloimmunization, and the complexity of Rh antibody identification. Inheritance of variant RH alleles explains
approximately one-third of Rh antibodies formed by patients with SCD. The remainder are stimulated by altered
Rh proteins on Black donor RBCs, who share similar RH genetic heterogeneity. Recruitment of Black donors is
necessary to support provision of C, E, K negative units for patients with SCD. In a pilot study, we demonstrated
the feasibility of identifying and transfusing >300 RH genotype matched donor units to chronically transfused
patients with SCD. Further studies are now required to demonstrate efficacy in preventing Rh alloimmunization.
In addition, a higher-throughput RH genotyping method and interpretation are needed to facilitate testing donors,
which are major barriers to widespread implementation. Lastly, the ability to identify the specific altered Rh
protein that is the target of the patient's immune response and responsible for incompatibility is critical for
selection of donor units. Precise identification of Rh epitopes responsible for antibody reactivity is hampered by
the lack of appropriate reagent RBCs with uncommon Rh antigen expression. The major goal of this proposal is
to provide a precision medicine approach to transfusion therapy for SCD by 1) providing RH genotype matched
red cells to chronically transfused patients with SCD and determine the effect on Rh antibody formation, 2) to
apply new next generation sequencing approaches and data analysis pipelines to identify a low-cost method to
accurately identify the complex RH genotypes in African Blacks, and 3) genetically engineer induced pluripotent
stem cells to generate red cells that express variant Rh proteins for precise antibody identification. In this
application, we propose three integrated aims that can address the current challenges of transfusion therapy for
SCD and will drive the field forward by providing innovative solutions to precisely match blood."
10880311,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the causative agents of cervical, anal and many oral cancers. While prophylactic vaccines have been developed to prevent HPV infections, there is no effective therapeutic treatment for existing HPV lesions. It is therefore of critical importance to understand how the productive life cycle of high- risk HPVs is regulated to identify potential new therapeutic targets. HPVs infect stratified squamous epithelia and link their productive life cycles to the differentiation of the infected cell. My laboratory demonstrated that the amplification of HPV genomes in differentiating cells is dependent on activation of two DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways: the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase pathway as well as the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway. We have identified members of these pathways that are important for the HPV life cycle and characterized many critical activities. We determined that in HPV positive cells the ATR binding protein, TopBP1, activated expression of DNA damage repair factors along with p73 while additional ATR factors, p62/GATA4, controlled expression of cytokines as well as IFNκ. Further work demonstrated that HPV proteins induced high rates of DNA breaks in both cellular and viral DNAs. The breaks in viral genomes were shown to be rapidly repaired through the preferential recruitment of homologous recombination repair factors such as RAD51 and BRCA1 to episomes and away from cellular sites of damage. This preferential repair resulted in genome amplification while at the same time permitting accumulation of breaks in cellular loci. The topoisomerase TOP2β induces DNA breaks to relieve torsional stress caused by transcription and replication. We determined that TOP2β levels were substantially increased in HPV positive cells and that this was responsible for the generation of a majority of breaks in HPV positive cells. Importantly knockdown of TOP2β impaired activation of DDR pathways and blocked viral replication. Additional work showed that HPV positive cells contain enhanced levels of R-loops which are trimeric complexes of RNA and DNA that lead to stalled replication forks and DNA breaks. R-loops were detected on HPV genomes in undifferentiated cells but resolved upon differentiation suggesting they may help in regulating viral functions. In this application, we will investigate how ATR regulates the stable maintenance of viral episomes in undifferentiated cells along with what determines which cells that undergo amplification upon differentiation. Additional work will examine which DDR and replication factors associate with amplifying genomes and how these pathways are activated. The overall goal of our studies is to understand how members of the DNA damage repair pathways regulate the differentiation- dependent HPV life cycle."
10880447,"Early graft injury is the consequence of unavoidable transplant-associated events, such as donor brain death,
ischemia/reperfusion injury, and surgical trauma. Recipient responses to graft alloantigens will also produce graft
damage throughout the life of the graft. These injuries and stresses cause the release of self-molecules
containing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It is well appreciated that DAMPs support pro-
inflammatory responses when they are sensed by cells of the innate immune system, particularly monocytes
and macrophages. Preclinical rodent heart transplant studies reveal that these released DAMPs initiate and
propagate alloresponses and targeting inflammatory DAMPs, or the signaling cascades they activate, reduce
alloimmunity and improve outcomes after transplantation. Yet, our recent research has provided compelling
evidence that these graft injuries also release reparative DAMPs (rDAMPs), such as Interleukin-33 (IL-33), which
limits local inflammation and initiates immune-mediated tissue repair after heart transplant. By assessing
pediatric heart transplant recipient samples and using a preclinical mouse heart transplant model, we identified
that IL-33 is upregulated in graft stromal cells and limits the development of allograft vasculopathy and graft
fibrosis that later culminates in chronic rejection (CR). Our published and preliminary data suggest that IL-33
mediates this protection by targeting infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, as well as regulatory T cells
(Tregs), to limit the generation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and then coordinate a Treg and reparative
macrophage-mediated response to injury. While these data are encouraging, our studies also suggest that the
processes that initiate repair of early tissue damage may become dysregulated over the graft's life. In preliminary
data, we show that vessel-associated Tregs become pathologic when their sustained secretion of repair factors
in response to IL-33 promotes the proliferation of local fibroblasts contributing to CR. In addition to having their
functions programmed by local rDAMPs, graft infiltrating recipient monocytes recognize allogenic molecules
causing them to mature into pro-inflammatory myeloid cells that stimulate T cell proliferation and IFNγ production
in the graft. We have established that monocytes and macrophages recognize and develop allospecific
cytotoxicity and memory to MHCI antigens via paired immunoglobulin-like receptors-A. These data lead us to
HYPOTHESIZE that rDAMP signals initiating the repair of tissue damage early after heart transplantation
become dysregulated around the vasculature due to a sustained inflammatory response by alloreactive immune
cells. We will test this hypothesis in two aims: In AIM 1, we will define how rDAMP and immune cell interactions
evolve in heart transplant microenvironments during CR development. In AIM 2, we will establish if innate
alloimmunity prevents effective injury resolution and repair after heart transplantation."
10880316,"SUMMARY
 Late stages of cancer metastasis involves the seeding of cancer cells at distant organs and the lethal
outgrowth of seeded cells. In 2019, virtually all 31,620 prostate cancer (PCa) deaths in the United States were
attributed to metastasis. Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is important for physiological development;
however, EMT promotes migration, invasion, and seeding in multiple cancer types. In contrast, EMT inhibits
proliferation and tumor outgrowth. SNAI1 and Twist1 are major EMT drivers that promote cancer cell seeding
and inhibit cell proliferation and tumor outgrowth, in non-PCa. SNAI1 expression is detected in invasive primary
and metastatic PCa. In contrast, the androgen receptor (AR) is a major driver of PCa cell proliferation and tumor
outgrowth. Of note, AR activates, but SNAI1 represses, transcription of Cyclin D1 (a cell cycle driver). Both bind
to an overlapping region of the ccnd1 (Cyclin D1) proximal promoter, suggesting direct competitive regulation of
Cyclin D1 transcription. Given that outgrowth occurs at the end of the metastasis cascade, EMT is likely to occur
transiently, early in PCa patients. In fact, vimentin (a marker of EMT) is highly expressed in PCa circulating tumor
cells; however, vimentin is lowly expressed once seeded PCa cells grow into detectable metastases. While EMT
and AR signaling have been independently investigated in PCa, how EMT and AR coordinate PCa metastasis
remains unclear. Adhering to the transient nature of EMT in clinical PCa, a TetON-SNAI1 expression system
was created, whereby transient expression of SNAI1 can be turned ON/OFF with doxycycline. Preliminary data
shows that SNAI1 induces a mesenchymal morphology in PCa cells, suppresses cell growth, and upregulates
mRNA of EMT markers such as vimentin and NPR2. However, AR signaling suppresses SNAI1’s ability to
upregulate vimentin and NRP2 and downregulates Twist1 mRNA, independent of SNAI1 expression. Altogether,
these data suggest that AR and SNAI1 have opposing roles in regulating EMT and proliferation; and are
consistent with the late sequence of events that occur during PCa metastasis: i.e., seeding followed by
outgrowth. Therefore, I hypothesize that SNAI1 mediates an anti-proliferative EMT-like invasion program to
promote PCa seeding; subsequently, AR antagonizes SNAI1-mediated cyclin D1 repression to restore
proliferation and promote metastatic outgrowth. The following aims are designed to address the central
hypothesis. Aim1: Determine how AR impacts SNAI1’s ability to promote PCa invasion and metastatic seeding.
Aim2: Determine how SNAI1 and AR regulate PCa proliferation. Aim3: Determine extent of AR and SNAI1 co-
expression and activity in clinical PCa samples. Patients with aggressive PCa are treated with standard anti AR-
signaling therapies; but will develop resistance within 2 years. Given the limited treatment options available for
this group of patients, further study of SNAI1 and AR will help develop research models that are more clinically
accurate and provide deeper insights for future therapeutic strategies."
10880317,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by hematopoietic stem
cell expansion and increased risk of transformation to frank leukemia. The hematopoietic stem cell compartment
in MPN is heterogeneous with the presence of both wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant cells in most patients with
MPNs. Despite mutant cells bearing an in vitro proliferative advantage because of constitutive kinase activity, in
some patients, there is little or no change in the mutant/wild-type cell ratio over long term follow up; while in
others, MPN can evolve to acute leukemia and patients experience high relapse rates following allogeneic stem
cell transplantation, the only curative treatment for these patients. JAK2V617F is also one of the common
mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and most individuals with such clonal
hematopoiesis do not convert to advanced disease. Utilizing in vitro co-culture assays and in vivo competitive
transplantation assays, we demonstrated that the presence of wild-type cells can prevent the expansion of co-
existing JAK2V617F mutant cells in a normal microenvironment. Delta-like ligand 1 (Dlk1), a noncanonical Notch
ligand important in stem cell maintenance, was significantly inhibited in JAK2V617F mutant hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells with competition compared to mutant cells without competition. We also found that a mutant
microenvironment can promote mutant cell expansion over wild-type cells. CXCL12, a chemokine critical for both
hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and immune suppression, was up-regulated in the mutant
microenvironment. Critically, both upregulated Dlk1 expression and dysregulated CXCL12 signaling have been
reported in patients with MPNs. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that, in the hematopoietic system,
competition between normal and neoplastic stem cells provides an essential mechanism to protect against
cancer development. The objective of the proposed work is to determine whether normal cells could potentially
be used as a therapeutic approach to control mutant clone expansion and the evolution of MPN to leukemia, in
combination with approaches targeting the MPN tumor microenvironment. In particular, we propose the following
two specific aims: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms by which wild-type cells prevent the expansion of JAK2V617F
mutant cells in a normal hematopoietic microenvironment. The roles of Dlk1 deregulation in cell competition-
induced JAK2V617F mutant stem cell suppression will be determined. 2) To study how the tumor immune
microenvironment alters the competition between wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant cells. The roles of tumor-
specific T cells and CXCL12 signaling in tumor microenvironment-induced mutant clonal expansion will be
defined. We expect these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the
competitive interactions between normal and neoplastic cells, and how these mechanisms break down during
cancer progression and relapse."
10879125,"Tuberculosis (TB) kills nearly 1.5 million people in the world. Despite powerful chemotherapeutics, surviving
bacteria often go undetected by standard diagnostics, persist in lung lesions, and continue to make patients ill,
even after declaration of microbiological “cure” as specified by criteria from the World Health Organization.
This project’s objective is to characterize the “(epi)genomic” (genomic and epigenomic) composition of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patients who require surgical intervention for treatment of tuberculosis
(TB), directly at the site of infection, and to create a knowledgebase that helps explain failure of chemotherapy
and standard diagnostics. Are these failures due to undetected resistant strains absent in the sputum? Were
there persister cells in pulmonary lesions that tolerated the drug pressure? Did drugs not reach bacteria within
the lesion in sufficient concentrations? Or were persistent or resistant bacilli in the sputum that went
undetected by standard diagnostics? Answering these questions will enable the development of new and more
sensitive diagnostics, inform development of novel therapeutics that to more effectively penetrate lesions and
target the surviving bacteria, or target all bacterial subpopulations, and enable rational design and
development of a vaccine with a more comprehensive understanding of genomic variability of this pathogen in
the context of human infection.
Mtb is an obligate human pathogen, yet treatment decisions hinge on phenotypic testing and genomic
characterization of bacteria isolated from sputum and grown in vitro as a proxy for the Mtb communities
driving infection in the lungs. Inconsistencies between the sputum and lung bacterial communities have been
hypothesized as reasons behind the mischaracterization of the disease. In this project, we investigate this
hypothesis and, additionally, aim to determine whether there are additional bacteria in the sputum that can
inform development of novel methods to provide more comprehensive diagnostics. In this process, we will also
determine whether persistence or superinfection played a role in treatment failure, and how frequently.
To reach these goals, this project will study bacteria residing within pulmonary lesions excised from 200
patients who failed traditional treatment. For the first time, we will directly sequence, and de novo assemble
genomes and methylomes of Mtb in pulmonary lesions and sputum, and determine the distinguishing genomic
and epigenetic characteristics of each subpopulation in these flora. We will detect hidden resistance or
persistence, and, through differential culturing, identify whether bacteria have been damaged by antibiotic
treatment and whether they are all detected by standard diagnostics. Our existing project has identified novel
rapid diversifying mechanisms that allows the bacterial community to withstand immune and drug pressures.
As part of this project, we will investigate the prevalence and nature of these mechanisms in the lung. This will
inform new paths to development of more effective and novel therapeutics and vaccines."

10879793,"Background and Significance: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric
disorder affecting approximately 170,000 Veterans in the VHA. OCD involves obsessions (unwanted, intrusive
thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive mental or physical actions aimed at reducing distress). Individuals with
OCD experience significant functional impairments and have an increased odds for reporting a lifetime history
of suicide attempts. Despite the prevalence and functional impairment associated with OCD, few Veterans with
this condition receive Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), the gold-standard intervention for OCD. ERP
is a behavioral treatment in which individuals are systematically exposed to feared situations that elicit distress
associated with OCD symptoms. In the VA, Veterans with OCD have a 2% chance of receiving this treatment.
To date, there is no data on the effectiveness of ERP for OCD in Veterans. The parent trial seeks to evaluate
the effectiveness of telehealth-delivered ERP for OCD in Veterans compared to a control condition, telehealth-
delivered Stress Management Training (SMT), within a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial.
Primary outcomes include changes in functioning and secondary outcomes include the evaluation of ERP's
potential for implementation. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of ERP, mixed-method economic
evaluations can help VA stakeholders evaluate tradeoffs between multiple strategies to address OCD in
Veterans and identify which interventions may have the greatest potential for adoption and sustainability.
Within mixed-method economic evaluation, quantitative analysis would include evaluating the health utilities of
Veterans with OCD (values associated with a particular health state) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (i.e., a
comparison of the difference in intervention costs to outcomes in OCD symptoms). Qualitative interviews would
provide information regarding context-specific factors affecting resources related to ERP delivery. Thus, the
aims of the current supplement are to understand the baseline health utility of Veterans with OCD as an
indicator of relative disease burden, to conduct a preliminary CEA of ERP for OCD, and conduct a qualitative
analysis of economic and resource-related factors as they pertain to ERP delivery. Research Plan: Aim 1:
Evaluate the health utility of Veterans wit OCD. This will be achieved by applying an algorithm to the Veterans
RAND-12, a generic measure of health-related quality of life. Aim 2: To conduct a cost effectiveness analysis
of ERP for changes in Quality Adjusted Life Years and OCD symptoms. This will be achieved by micro-costing
the ERP and SMT interventions to obtain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the difference in costs
compared to difference in outcomes (i.e., OCD symptoms and Quality Adjusted Life Years). Aim 3: To evaluate
the contextual factors impacting the cost and resources required for ERP implementation via qualitative
methods. Dr. Plasencia will achieve this evaluation by adding questions to existing qualitative interviews
surrounding cost and resource considerations in current and future ERP delivery. Career Plan: Dr. Plasencia
will receive training in conducting cost-effectiveness analysis in addition to learning about hybrid
effectiveness/implementation trials via work on the parent grant. These goals will occur through a combination
of mentorship, readings, courses, and experiential training. Dr. Plasencia plans to develop and submit a CDA-2
application during the course of the proposed supplement. Aims and training from the current supplement will
support Dr. Plasencia's goal of becoming an independently funded VA researcher focused on the
implementation of evidence-based interventions for anxiety and depression across the continuum of care."
10880247,"PROJECT SUMMARY _____
Thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) are small, adhesive protein domains that are found in phyla as diverse
as chordates, nematodes, and apicomplexans. TSR-bearing proteins, which are typically localized to the cell
surface or extracellular matrix, serve a wide variety of functions, including cell attachment and motility. TSRs
are usually glycosylated at highly conserved motifs wherein tryptophans may be modified with a C-linked
mannose and a conserved serine or threonine residue may be modified with an O-linked fucose.
Parasites of the genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of the disease malaria, express ten conserved TSR-
bearing proteins at various stages throughout their life cycle. Disrupting any one of them severely disrupts or
halts parasite development. The most extensively studied of the TSR-bearing proteins are the sporozoite
surface proteins CSP and TRAP. It has been shown that the TSRs in these proteins contain motifs that bind to
proteoglycans and thus play a role in parasite invasion of host cells. We have recently used mass spectrometry
to demonstrate for the first time that the TSRs of CSP and TRAP are glycosylated in vivo. This discovery
revealed a gap in the understanding of these otherwise well-studied invasins: TSR-bearing proteins are critical
to the Plasmodium life cycle, yet nothing is known about the role of glycosylation in maintaining their function
or virulence.
We hypothesize that the O-fucosylation and C-mannosylation of TSRs in Plasmodium is required for the proper
function of the glycosylated proteins, and we predict that preventing glycosylation of these proteins will inhibit
their function and disrupt the Plasmodium life cycle. In order to test this hypothesis, we will first characterize
the glycosylation status of all TSR-bearing proteins expressed in P. falciparum. We will then generate
transgenic parasite lines with mutations that prevent modification of the TSRs of specific proteins in order to
determine the role of glycosylation in the function of these virulence factors."
10880248,"Project Summary - The complexity of cardiovascular disease has hindered our understanding of its
deveopment and progression. To uncover the mechanisms by which genetic variation and environmental
factors influence cardiovascular development and disease, the next generation of scientists will need to be
trained to use a variety of approaches, technologies and model systems. In response to this demand, the
Integrative Vascular Biology (IVB) Pre-doctoral Training Program was established at UNC in 2002 to promote a
collaborative interdisciplinary training environment for pre-doctoral students in the cardiovascular field. The IVB
Program combines the breadth and depth of the cardiovascular research faculty with other research strengths
at UNC in genetic model systems, state-of-the-art cell biology and imaging, high throughput genomic and
proteomic analyses, and computational biology. The overall goal of the IVB Program is to provide Trainees
with the interdisciplinary and collaborative skills necessary to extend their thesis work into new,
innovative, and productive directions. Specific Aim 1 is to connect Trainees in broad areas of
cardiovascular research by requiring them to collaborate with secondary mentors outside of their field. This
training mechanism was specifically designed to “connect” graduate students in broad areas of cardiovascular
biology and cardiovascular health research. The program teaches students to apply molecular, cellular,
genetic, and computational approaches to pathological and physiological questions in cell, organ, and whole
animal systems; to merge hypothesis- and discovery-based research; and to develop high-throughput
approaches for use in complex models. Specific Aim 2 is to provide Trainees with a broad understanding of
cardiovascular development and disease. This will be achieved through advanced paper-based cardiovascular
courses, cardiovascular seminars by leaders in the field, and through bi-weekly student-led discussion groups.
Specific Aim 3 is to enhance the skills necessary for effective collaboration and career advancement. Trainees
will improve their communication skills by presenting their work at formal and informal IVB events and students
will attend IVB Workshops on grant writing, career development, and scientific rigor and responsibility. The IVB
Program is administered by UNC McAllister Heart Institute and is directed by Dr. Christopher Mack a
respected vascular biologist who has been heavily involved in graduate student training at multiple levels. He is
assisted by Associate Director, Vicki Bautch, and former IVB director Nobuyo Maeda. The major strength of
the Program is the breadth and diversity of the 42 primary training faculty who are committed to graduate
student training, extremely well-funded, and using cutting edge approaches to answer a wide-variety of
cardiovascular questions. When combined with a well-developed academic program in Cardiovascular Science
(also directed by Dr. Mack) and a large pool of well-qualified applicants, the UNC Integrative Vascular Biology
Program offers an outstanding environment for multidisciplinary training of pre-doctoral students."
10879424,"Project Summary
Down syndrome (DS) affects 1 in 700 newborns in the United States. It is the most common genetic cause of
intellectual disability. DS individuals also frequently present with cardiac anomalies and are at increased risk for
Alzheimer's disease, hematological neoplasia, autoimmune conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, celiac disease,
type I diabetes, arthritis), and inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), alopecia areata (AA),
and vitiligo, but also psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Studies have shown that the inflammatory and
autoimmune comorbidities associated with DS may be due to overt inflammation caused by increases in many
cytokines which signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. This inflammation may also be due to increased
presence of type I, II and III interferon receptors, all encoded on chromosome 21, which also use JAK/STAT
pathway to signal. Treatment of inflammatory skin diseases in individuals with DS involves broad
immunosuppressive medications, which are often associated with multiple side effects and limited efficacy. Given
the
term
hyperactivation of JAK/STAT signaling in DS, JAK inhibition presents an appealing alternative for better long-
 disease control.Several case reports, case series, and studies across inflammatory joint and skin
conditions showed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in individuals with DS.
Importantly, none of these studies reported new safety concerns. Further, more selective JAK inhibitors, such
as the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, demonstrated potential in synergistically ameliorating hematologic
conditions associated with DS. This is consistent with our own studies, in which ex vivo tofacitinib successfully
attenuated hyperinflammation in individuals with DS. However, while tofacitinib is approved in rheumatoid
arthritis, it has not been FDA-approved for any skin indications (risk was determined by the FDA to outweigh
benefit in psoriasis), and nor has oral ruxolitinib. Thus, individuals with DS deserve timely and appropriate
evaluation of the long-term safety and efficacy of newer and more specific JAK inhibitors that are currently FDA-
approved for dermatological indications, such as AD and AA. Since a particularly higher inflammatory tone has
been shown in DS, the dosing of these newer drugs and their long-term safety and efficacy should also be
evaluated in patients with DS. Such drugs include abrocitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor that was recently approved for
moderate-to-severe AD in both typical adults and typical adolescents aged at least 12 years, and ritlecitinib, a
JAK3/TEC inhibitor that has completed phase 3 studies in AA and has just obtained FDA approval in AA. Herein
we propose a clinical trial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 60 weeks of treatment of the low and
high dose of abrocitinib in individuals with DS presenting with AD and AA, and of ritlecitinib in those individuals
with AA that did not adequately respond to abrocitinib within the first 24 weeks of treatment."

computations, and their evolution over time due to learning, homeostatic plasticity, and other processes. The
composition of brain circuits out of a large number of cell types, which may be defined by the characteristic
patterns of gene expression, and the intricate connectivity of these circuits are expected to be intimately
related to their functional properties.
However, the exact nature of these relationships is far from clear. The concept of a cell type itself, especially
when considered at a fine-grained level, with a hundred or more cell types in any given brain area, is under
active research in the community. A central question is whether and how transcriptomically-defined cell types
provide specific underpinnings for broader circuit properties, such as those expressed in anatomy – defined by
neuron’s location, morphology, connectivity – or in the functional types of neuronal activity in vivo.
The proposed project will address this question by investigating the links between molecular and anatomical
cell types to circuits and function in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We will connect the types of
functional visual responses in vivo with transcriptomic types via multiplexed fluorescence in-situ hybridization
(mFISH). Calcium imaging of neural activity will be carried out across the full cortical depth in V1, co-registered
with mFISH imaging of that tissue, and the transcriptomic types of the neurons will be determined, establishing
links between each neuron’s function and its type.
In parallel, we will use a unique functional connectomics dataset already obtained at the Allen Institute, in
which Electron Microscopy (EM) images are co-registered with in vivo imaging data from V1. These data will
permit us to map the functional properties of each neuron to its morphological type and connectivity
characteristics, resolved in the EM volume. The morphological type will, in turn, allow us to compare this
dataset with the transcriptomic types, using our earlier PatchSeq dataset, where triple-modality data of
morphology, intrinsic electrophysiology, and transcriptomics was obtained for individual neurons.
These data and analyses will be freely shared with the scientific community. We will provide a web-based
resource through the Allen Institute Cell Type Cards portal, linking across transcriptomic, morphological,
connectivity, and functional types in these datasets.
Thus, this project will uncover the relations between transcriptomic types, cortical circuit structure, and its
function, while providing a major resource for a broad spectrum of future studies in this area."

Endothelial cells line the lumen of all blood vessels and play a critical role in maintaining the barrier function of
the vasculature. Diminished barrier function and the consequent increase in vascular permeability to plasma
proteins and leukocytes has been described in pathological conditions such as acute respiratory distress
syndrome and acute lung injury. The resulting tissue edema is associated with loss of aerated lung tissue and
high mortality and morbidity. We have discovered that Polymerase delta interacting protein-2 (Poldip2), a protein
with multiple binding partners, is an important modulator of lung endothelial barrier function. Remarkably, using
a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury model or P. aeruginosa infection, we observed that heterozygous
deletion of Poldip2 nearly abolishes barrier dysfunction and extravasation of leukocytes into the lung, markedly
improving survival. The effect of Poldip2 depletion on permeability is phenocopied in mice with endothelial-
specific deletion of Poldip2. The phenotype of these animals is striking, suggesting that we have identified a
novel and previously unappreciated major target for diseases related to endothelial barrier dysfunction. However,
very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which Poldip2 regulates endothelial permeability, and
almost nothing has been published about how Poldip2 itself is regulated. To ultimately test the therapeutic
potential of Poldip2 inhibitors, it is critical to first understand how Poldip2 depletion maintains the endothelial
barrier. In this project, we will address these gaps in our knowledge, as well as develop small molecules with
which to explore Poldip2’s function and therapeutic potential. In the first aim, we plan to define the mechanism
by which endothelial Poldip2 regulates barrier function, focusing on the role of RhoA oxidation. In the second
Aim, we will focus on post-translational modifications of Poldip2 as a novel mechanism of regulation, using mass
spectrometry to identify modifications of interest and site-directed mutagenesis to test their effect on endothelial
permeability. Finally, in Aim 3, we plan to investigate whether a putative pharmacological inhibitor of Poldip2 can
be used experimentally to develop new, more specific inhibitors that will enable us to probe function and test
whether pharmacological inhibition of Poldip2 can mitigate lung edema and inflammatory cell incursion in a
mouse model of acute lung injury. Together, these three aims will allow us to gain new insight into the regulation
and downstream signaling pathways of Poldip2, a novel therapeutic target for treatment of lung edema."

Emotions are central to human functioning, guiding thought and action from the earliest to the latest days of
life1–3. Emotional experiences change over the adult life span, with older adults shifting their motivational goals
towards optimizing emotional regulation and reporting positive emotions more often that their younger
counterparts1–3. However, affective symptoms, such as anxiety, mood instability, and apathy are common
conditions among older adults and may herald incipient neuropsychiatric disorders4,5. Social behavior and
human emotions are shaped by the intimate, dynamic interactions between the autonomic nervous system
(ANS)6–8 and the salience network9–11, a distributed brain network12,13 critical for homeostatic regulation and
emotions14–17 anchored by the anterior cingulate and fronto-insular cortices9–11,18. Loneliness – the subjective
experience of feeling socially isolated – has recently been identified as a major modifiable risk factor for
cognitive decline and worsening of social-emotional well-being in older adults 19–22. Loneliness, which has
gained increasing relevance due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic23,24, has been shown to spread among
social networks through a contagious process 19–22 , to predict low life satisfaction, depressive symptoms,
cognitive impairments, and Alzheimer’s disease dementia among older persons19–22. The overarching goal of
the parent project is to better understand the neural underpinning of social-emotional functioning in older adults
and to elucidate the impact of loneliness on these neural systems. More specifically, two aims are at the core
of the parent grant: (1) to elucidate whether distinct emotional stimuli induce dissociable signatures of salience
network and autonomic activity in older adults, and (2) to assess the impact of loneliness on neural systems
supporting social-emotional functions in older adults. Towards these aims, we will recruit 40 lonely and 40 non-
lonely older adults based on their scores on the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale (5 or above indicate loneliness).
All participants will be assessed with simultaneous functional MRI and autonomic physiology recordings, both
during resting-state conditions and during an emotional reactivity task. Advanced computational methods
designed to unravel the dynamic nature of neural activity will be used to derive neural signatures of activity that
differentiate among emotion states and to assess how these neural systems are affected by loneliness in older
adults."
10874192,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Parent)
The proposed project will provide critical information to inform the development and implementation of
interventions to improve the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia. National
guidelines strongly recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive routine screenings and be offered
preventive medications to reduce the risk of serious complications including infections, strokes, and pain
crises. Although these complications are associated with increased health services utilization and cost, and
reduced quality of life, only 40% of children receive routine screenings and less than 20% receive preventive
medications. Significantly, the mechanisms driving quality gaps in the receipt of preventive services are
unknown, limiting our ability to develop and implement impactful interventions. The overall objective of this
study is to shed light on these mechanisms and identify opportunities to optimize receipt of preventive services
among children with sickle cell anemia, thus reducing disease burden and improving quality of life. The
proposed study directly impacts the following AHRQ priority populations: children, racial and ethnic minorities,
low-income patients, and those with special healthcare needs. As such, it aligns with AHRQ’s mission to
improve efficiency and quality of health care delivery for vulnerable populations.
 Using a mixed methods approach, we will (1) identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery
system, as well as key subgroups of the population, through which intervention can improve the receipt of
preventive services for children with sickle cell anemia; (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of receipt of
preventive services, and (3) integrate the quantitative findings of patterns of care and adherence deficiencies
with the qualitative findings of barriers and facilitators to preventive services to identify intervention targets and
strategies that are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services. The mixed methods approach includes
analyzing data from three large complementary, nationally representative datasets, combined with primary
qualitative data collection. The datasets provide a novel opportunity to provide a population-based perspective
on the care of children with sickle cell anemia, as well as national data on prescribing practices. Quantitative
methods, including machine learning and time-dependent survival analysis, will enable us to characterize
patterns of care associated with receipt of preventive services, as well variation in adherence across providers,
patients, caregivers, and insurance type. Qualitative, key informant interviews with provider teams, caregivers,
and patients will identify potential barriers to and facilitators of adherence to each preventive service, as well as
opportunities for intervention. Finally, the visual integration of the quantitative analysis with the qualitative
findings through a joint display will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and
strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among
children with sickle cell anemia."

Core A – Administrative Core
The goal of the Administrative Core of the Northwell Roybal Center for Personalized Trials: Physical
Activity Promotion for Persons Giving Care or Living with AD/ADRD is to establish the organizational and
administrative management of the proposed center, as well as ensuring that all relevant expertise is
represented in the Center where needed.
Our Administrative Core will develop and provide the strategic vision, leadership, and the full range of NIH
Stage Model expertise needed for the success of this Roybal Center; monitor Center clinical trials progress
and provide immediate feedback; develop, identify, and use common metrics for Center productivity evaluation
purposes: and finally facilitate collaboration with other Roybal Centers, with the Coordinating Center, with NIA
(National Institute on Aging), and with scientists across the nation interested in advancing the initiation and
maintenance of physical activity regimens personalized to care providers or those living with AD/ADRD.
The overall mission of the Northwell Roybal Center for Personalized Trials is to establish an infrastructure
organized per the NIH Stage Model with scientiﬁc expertise and resources to conduct Stages 0-V trials of the
translational behavioral intervention development pipeline, as well as examining key MoBCs of behavior
change, and so serve as a national resource for the behavioral and social intervention research community in
initiating and maintaining personalized physical activity regimen for caregivers or persons living with
AD/ADRD."
10874267,"In partnership with large health care and commercial entities that serve as field sites for testing and scaling
interventions the goal of the proposed Penn Roybal Center is to accelerate the pace and increase the reach
and impact of scientific discovery on the application of behavioral economics to health behavior change at
scale. To achieve this goal, our proposal has three strategic foci: Design thinking, digital platforms, and
dynamic adaptation. Design thinking ensures user-centeredness of and customized engagement with
interventions, avoiding one-size-fits-none pitfalls. Digital platforms enable us to test promising interventions in
ways that can readily be translated to scaled application and to better leverage scarce intervention resources,
increasing the probability of scalability. Dynamic adaptation opens up possibilities to “learn as we go” during
intervention trials using information on engagement and intervention responsiveness to drive further resource
allocation decisions. This strategic focus complements several themes highlighted in the RFA: targeting
mechanisms of behavior change (MoBC) common to multiple health behaviors, utilizing behavioral economics
approaches to improve individual behavior, and leveraging technology to ensure fidelity and scalability.
Deploying these strategies, the Behavioral Intervention Development Core will nurture early-stage pilots
through the NIH Stage Model with a plan to advance to larger-scale (Stages III and IV) field studies conducted
with private and public sector implementation partners. We will work with our strong network of collaborating
organizations on implementation and dissemination (Stage V) of effective interventions. Our Administrative
Core will provide infrastructure to support research activities in behavioral economics and health at the
University of Pennsylvania and among affiliated faculty at other universities.
Specific Aims are to:
1.) Facilitate and support research across the NIH Stage model that advances the translation of behavioral
economic concepts to improved health and health behaviors for older adults (NIH Stages 0-V);
2.) Cultivate testing of mechanisms of behavior change and early-stage feasibility pilots (Stages 0-I);
3.) Support testing of promising Stage I ideas with potential to improve the health at scale in research and
community settings (Stages II-IV);
4.) Collaborate with external health care organizations to disseminate our findings and support the
implementation of effective interventions (NIH Stage V)."
10874504,"Project 5 ABSTRACT
The effects from hazardous substances in the environment can be compounded by their mobilization and
redistribution in polluted sediment, soil, water and air following natural disasters and emergencies. Of immediate
concern is the safety of safe water and food supplies. Other threats include soil contamination (lawns, community
gardens, parks and recreational areas), along with increased risk of human dermal and inhalation exposures
near the site of the impact. A major challenge associated with these emergencies is protecting vulnerable
communities and neighborhoods, first responders to the disaster, frontline personnel, and those involved in the
management and cleanup of the site. Thus, the ability to rapidly minimize hazardous substance effects during
disaster events is a critical need. In Aim 1 of this proposal, multicomponent sorbents will be synthesized from
diverse materials and compounds that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and these sorbents will tightly
bind environmental chemicals and design mixtures with high capacity and affinity. The reaction kinetics,
thermodynamics and fundamental mechanism(s) involved in interactions between the surfaces of selected
sorbent materials and hazardous environmental chemicals and mixtures will be determined using currently
available in vitro methods. Computational methods will be used to validate and provide fundamental insights, as
well as to predict sorbent properties and screen for optimum GRAS amendments, thus providing feedback and
integration with all experiments. Well-established animal and plant organisms that possess a low tolerance for
environmental chemicals in water, soil, and sediment will include the Cnidarian model system (Hydra vulgaris),
the Lemna minor (duckweed) assay, and the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode assay. These living (in vivo)
model systems will be used to predict the toxicity of polluted samples and to validate the efficacy of our selected
sorbents and our in vitro and in silico results. In Aim 2, multicomponent sorbents will be developed that will
remove hazardous substances from contaminated food, drinking water and soil. Novel barrier formulations will
be developed for skin protection and for filter inserts in protective masks to reduce dermal and inhalation
exposures to chemicals. In Aim 3, our in vivo models will be used to evaluate real-life environmental samples
from disaster sites and well-characterized superfund sites. In these studies, optimal sorbents and levels of
inclusion that will result in detoxification of hazardous substances will be determined. Existing collaborations with
Community Engagement Core, well-established technology transfer expertise, and interdisciplinary interactions
in Project 5 will add an important capability and dimension to the overall Center. The project-to-field pathway for
the development of broad-acting sorbents and formulations for hazardous chemicals during the course of our
study has been firmly established. We have identified relevant stakeholders and vulnerable communities that
will benefit from these products. It is expected that sorbent and barrier technology developed in this research will
result in reduced chemical exposures in people and animals during disasters and emergencies."
10874505,"Administrative & Research Translation Core ABSTRACT
The Administrative and Research Translation Core is the central hub for all activities of the Texas A&M University
Superfund Research Center. It is organized around three key functions that will enable it to be an effective and
nimble coordinator of the proposed research, outreach, training, and translation activities: (1) administration and
fiscal management, (2) integration of cross-disciplinary disaster response research (DR2), and (3) outreach and
research translation. This Core is physically located in the Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences at
Texas A&M University in College Station, TX. The Core operates through regular Center-wide and project-
specific meetings, tracks the productivity of the Center, develops future activities, and guides scientific innovation
through a pilot project program. The Core is led by Center Director (Ivan Rusyn) and Associate Director
(Weihsueh Chiu), and includes an administrative manager and a fiscal manager. The Core is coordinating Center
leadership and activities with two committees. The PIs of the projects and cores in the Center form a Scientific
Steering Committee, which meets monthly. External oversight of the Center is the responsibility of an External
Advisory Committee, which meets annually to perform program evaluation of the Center and determine whether
research, outreach, training, and translation goals and objectives are being met. This Committee is a diverse
group of highly qualified experts representing academia, federal and state governmental agencies, industry, and
non-governmental organizations. The Core’s work is organized around five Specific Aims. First, the Core
provides effective administrative and fiscal management with input from the Scientific Steering and External
Advisory Committees. The Core conducts program planning and evaluation and assessment of Center
performance. Second, the Core enables integration of cross-disciplinary DR2 research through monthly
meetings, annual retreats, and internal/external collaborations. The Core issues annual calls for pilot projects,
coordinates their review and oversees deliverables from each pilot project. Third, the Core promotes
dissemination of the Center’s outputs to NIEHS and other stakeholders. Fourth, the Core maintains and expands
partnerships with government (local/state/Federal) agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
community partners. It will continue holding regular meetings with the end-users to showcase Center’s work and
conduct demonstration workshops. Finally, the Core is advancing the practical application of Center DR2
research through technology transfer. All Center faculty, staff and trainees will interact with the Core as it
executes its administrative (overall and fiscal management, integration) and research translation
(communication, outreach, technology transfer) functions."
10874507,"Community Engagement Core (CEC) ABSTRACT
The residents of communities located along the Galveston Bay/Houston Ship Channel (GB/HSC) region have
been shown to have excess risk of exposures to hazardous substances as a result of various environmental and
anthropogenic disasters. In addition to the physical and environmental vulnerabilities, many of the residents of
these communities are also socially vulnerable. Community engagement can provide a link between the adaptive
capacities of a community—the human, financial, political, and social resources that enable proactive behavior
and the combined strength of local plans and policies—and its responses and changes after disasters. An
engaged community has greater resilience and is better able to anticipate future threats and prepare for and
recover from adverse events. The Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center is focused on
development, application, and translation of a comprehensive set of tools and models that will aid in mitigating
the human health consequences of exposures to hazardous substances during environmental emergency-
related contamination events. Accordingly, the Community Engagement Core (CEC) will develop, test and
implement a set of data-driven community engagement projects focused on fostering local resilience through
disaster research response activities. Work in the CEC will be based on locally-driven needs and grounded in
exposure science and multidisciplinary environmental health research. The CEC is working in close partnership
with a large number of local organizations, planners, other stakeholders, and residents. Specifically, we will
pursue four community engagement aims: 1) Engage community members to determine the factors that
influence and can improve environmental conditions for communities to proactively plan and manage future
environmental risk related to emergency contamination; 2) Develop collaborative, participatory-based
interventions aimed at reducing exposure during environmental emergencies; 3) Develop and implement citizen
science tools for community engagement to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances; and 4)
Build long-term resilience in the communities by creating capacity for detection, assessment, and evaluation of
the human health concerns from hazardous substances. The activities proposed under each Aim are aligned
with existing, and well-documented, stakeholder priorities and build on prior work done with community partners.
Further, the prevention/intervention activities in the CEC specifically support Superfund’s fourth mandate which
includes ""basic biological, chemical, and physical methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous
substances” through the development of evidence-based strategies and an emphasis on neighborhood-scaled
green infrastructure provisions to increase resilience and mitigate hazard and contamination impacts. The CEC
will involve community partners in the entire cycle of activities, from study design, to data collection, developing
resilience strategies, communication of the findings to all stakeholders, and assistance with implementation."
10885029,"Project Summary
Patients recovering from painful surgical procedures commonly receive opioids during their inpatient and post-
operative periods to help manage pain and initiate the recovery process. Nonetheless, access to opioids after surgery
puts patients at increased risk of becoming a chronic user. Over 80% of surgical patients receive opioids after low-risk
surgery with many patients receiving opioids more than the amount needed to control pain. Overprescribing
increases the risk of diversion and misuse. Conversely, under-prescribing may leave many patients open to
uncontrolled pain and subsequent emergency care. Current opioid discharge clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) involve
lowering maximum discharge defaults, high level warnings, defaults pegged to procedures received by patients, or
warnings based on prior opioid utilization. However, research suggests that post-surgery pain management should be
tailored to each patient based on individual pain experience and pain tolerance. These insights suggest that a patient-
centered CPG for post-operative pain management is needed. However, patient-centered CPGs are cumbersome and
time consuming to implement by hand from hospital electronic health records (EHR) at discharge. A 2020 National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine document emphasized the need to find patient-centered opioid
prescribing CPG for acute pain. A clinical decision support (CDS) tool is needed to quickly synthesize patient-specific
data from the EHR to promote the use of patient-centered opioid discharge CPGs.
Toward this goal, three recent studies provide a strong clinical rationale that inpatient opioid use the day before
discharge affords a sound proxy for individual pain experience and pain tolerance at discharge to guide patient-
centered post-discharge opioid prescribing. Surgeons in the General Surgery department at Prisma Health in South
Carolina used this rationale to develop a patient-centered opioid discharge CPG that was implemented in their
department in March 2018. The percentage of patients with CPG-compliant opioid discharge prescriptions increased
from 10% to 25.8% after implementation,59 the department-wide average opioid discharge level fell, and the General
Surgeons anecdotally found little negative patient response from these reductions. Despite these positive results,
General Surgeons reported that the extra time required to apply the CPG within a busy practice limited its broader
use which reflects findings in the literature. Currently, the patient-centered CPG requires providers to perform a
detailed analysis of patient charts by hand that can add 5-10 minutes per patient to the discharge process. In
addition, with only anecdote available, the evidence on patient outcomes from use of the patient-centered CPG is not
definitive. We believe that a patient-centered opioid prescribing tool (PCOPT) that immediately incorporates patient-
specific information from EHR into the discharge process will significantly increase compliance with the patient-
centered opioid discharge CPG. In addition, we will implement the PCOPT using an effectiveness-implementation
hybrid Type II study design to yield definitive evidence on the effects of the patient-centered CPG on patient
outcomes on outcomes using orthopaedic trauma patients with a lower- extremity fracture. Our proposal is in
response to the Special Emphasis Notice (SEN): AHRQ Announces Interest in Health Services Research to Address the
Opioids Crisis (NOT-HS-18-015)."
10885030,"Project Summary: Prevention of Infections Through Appropriate Staffing (PITAS) Study
Nationally, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a costly patient safety concern in acute care hospitals.
Infection Preventionists (IPs) and infection prevention and control (IPC) departments play an integral role in
implementing evidence-based policies and procedures to prevent, mitigate and control HAIs. However,
evidence describing and validating appropriate IP staffing is lacking. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has
placed an enormous strain on the healthcare system. Emerging evidence suggests that the pandemic has
resulted in increased rates of HAI in the acute care setting. However, the impact of the pandemic on IPC
departments, including staffing and resources, and on routine IPC activities is unknown. We designed a unique
and innovative study to determine how IPC departments have responded to the pandemic and the
effectiveness of IPC infrastructure and processes in preventing HAIs. Guided by Donabedian’s framework of
quality, we propose a 3-year mixed method study to: 1) Describe the evolution of IPC programs from 2011 to
2019 and determine the effectiveness of IPC staffing, infrastructure and processes in preventing HAI in acute
care hospitals; 2) Quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infection prevention and control
departments, HAI rates and rates of antibiotic resistance in acute care hospitals; and 3) Develop an in-depth
understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on infection preventionists, IPC resources and practices in acute
care hospitals. In Aim 1, building upon our previous work, we will link hospital surveys to longitudinal National
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) HAI and staffing data (2011-2019) to examine effectiveness of IPC
staffing, infrastructure and processes on reducing HAI. In Aim 2, we will conduct a national survey of U.S.
hospitals and link the survey to NHSN (2011-2022) and CMS data (2018-2022) to examine the impact of
COVID-19. In Aim 3, we will conduct interviews with personnel involved in infection prevention and control in
20 hospitals. In our earlier federally-funded work, using a longitudinal sample of NHSN hospitals, we found that
high clinician compliance with bundled care and positive organizational climate were associated with lower HAI
rates in ICUs. We now propose to develop a more comprehensive examination of the impact of IPC staffing on
HAI rates by expanding the analysis beyond the ICU and including other types of HAI. We will also evaluate
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IPC staffing and infrastructure, which is an area previously not
studied. As Early Stage and New Investigators, we represent the epitome of interdisciplinary and intercollegiate
research. We have designed an innovative study that builds upon our established relationship with
internationally-renown researchers and NHSN hospitals, refines psychometrically sound instruments, and fills
an important gap in the evidence. The results of this study will provide the evidence to strengthen IPC capacity
and preparedness in acute care hospitals to more effectively respond to future infectious disease crisis."
10885152,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in children. MB is frequently induced
by the alterations of cellular signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog and wingless pathways, which have
been extensively characterized. Nevertheless, current treatment of MB causes severe life-long side effects and
fails to cure many patients. Thus, there is an unmet need for a new mechanistic understanding that would be
helpful for designing a mechanism-based approach for MB treatment. Epigenetic aberrations, which are heritable
aberrations in gene expression or cellular phenotypes without accompanying changes in DNA sequences, are a
major factor for tumorigenesis. Epigenetic modifiers often harbor DNA alterations, such as mutations and
deletions, in human MB. However, the roles of epigenetic modifiers in MB development remain largely unknown.
Histone lysine methylation, a type of histone posttranslational modification, is a hallmark of epigenetic and
transcriptional regulation of gene expression and is reversibly modified by histone methyltransferases and
demethylases. Of histone lysine methylation, methylations at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) are key gene-activating
epigenomic marks. For example, monomethyl H3K4 is a mark for enhancers, which activate genes by interacting
with gene promoters. In addition, trimethyl H3K4 occupies as much as 75 % of all human gene-regulatory regions,
and broad trimethyl H3K4 is a gene-activating signature that denotes tumor suppressor and cell identity genes.
We have previously reported that the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D (also called MLL4, ALR, and MLL2; a
transcriptional coactivator) is required for retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of human neuron-lineage
NT2/D1 stem cells. Notably, our other study showed that homozygous loss of Kmt2d in the mouse brain
developed spontaneous MB in the cerebellum, a brain region that controls motor coordination and balance.
Strikingly, our additional results showed that heterozygous loss (single-allelic) of Kmt2d highly promoted MB.
Based on these compelling findings, our long-term goal is to define the oncogenic role of heterozygous loss of
Kmt2d in MB pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that heterozygous loss of Kmt2d causes epigenomic
alterations to downregulate tumor suppressor genes and thereby promotes MB. Here, we propose to study to 1)
characterize the MB-promoting effect of heterozygous Kmt2d loss using genetically engineered mouse models;
2) define the molecular mechanism by which heterozygous Kmt2d loss promotes MB; and 3) determine how
heterozygous Kmt2d loss causes epigenomic alterations. Because KMT2D is one of the most frequently mutated
genes in MB and a majority of KMT2D mutations in MB are heterozygous and truncations, our proposed studies
are significant and clinically relevant. In addition, our studies using genetically engineered mouse models will
define an in vivo MB-promoting role for heterozygous Kmt2d loss. Furthermore, our results will uncover the
previously unappreciated epigenetic mechanism underlying MB pathogenesis and provide valuable information
for the rational design of a therapeutic approach for MB treatment."
10885047,"Visual information detected by the retina is sent for further processing to deeper layers of the visual centers that feed
into specialized behavior circuits. Much is known about how visual centers and local circuits function, but we do not
understand how the many cell types that compose them are generated and how these circuits assemble and are coordinated between brain regions. We study the simplified, yet highly performing visual system of Drosophila for which we have obtained a deep understanding of neural diversity, mechanisms that also apply to mammalian neurogenesis.
 In a separately funded grant, we have generated a very large dataset where we have identified through single cell mRNA sequencing the individual transcriptome of most (169 neural types) neurons and glia in the four optic lobe ganglia, lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate, through six development stages starting when the neurons are first generated. This represents a huge resource that will allow us to identify the molecular pathways involved in the processes studied here.
 In the current proposal, we will define how the circuits formed by optic lobe neurons are assembled and how development of the different optic lobe neuropils is synchronized:
Aim 1. Retinotopic projection of photoreceptors to the lamina and medulla.
We will define the role of the lamina in the establishment of retinotopy in the medulla and what guides photoreceptors and lamina neurons to their retinotopic location. We will then identify the molecular guidance pathways involved in pathfinding in lamina and medulla, and determine the potential role of pioneer neurons that might guide retinotopy of the other neurons.
Aim 2 Timing of differentiation and layer formation in the medulla neuropil.
Medulla neurons are born from the same neural progenitors in a sequential order, a fundamental mechanism of 'temporal patterning'. We will test the model that temporal patterning allows medulla neurons to progressively innervate each layer of the lobula and of the medulla and we will define the molecular mechanisms synchronizing birth order and layer formation.
Aim 3: Development of output neurons from the lobula: Visual features and optic glomeruli.
Signals from the medulla are conveyed to the lobula and are then passed on to Lobula Columnar Neurons (LCNs) that
connect to 'optic glomeruli' that control behavior. We will study how ~20 subtypes of LCNs connect to different layers of
the lobula and to specific glomeruli in the central brain and will define the molecular mechanisms of their specific targeting.
Aim 4. Building the broad-field motion pathway.
Motion is computed by neurons that compare the outputs of upstream neurons in a specific orientation. We will investigate the developmental programs that instruct the dendrite orientation of the first orientation-selective neurons (T4 and T5) and how they each project to one of the 4 layers of the lobula plate that each detects motion in one of 4 cardinal directions. This study will provide fundamental insights into the coordination of various elements of a simple and amenable visual system. Our findings will not only provide novel fundamental concepts for the development of circuits for sensory processing, but will also contribute general concepts applicable to circuit formation in vertebrates."

10885059,"Abstract
 Only 12.7% to 82.9% of the U.S. population receives recommended prevention services, and more
specifically, between 70.7% to 91.9% of U.S. children aged 19-35 months receive recommended
immunizations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC). The utilization of clinical decision support
(CDS) can help to increase these rates. Meta-analyses have shown that CDS, as a component of electronic
health records (EHRs), is effective in increasing preventive care services. The rules for a CDS involve the
knowledge needed to decide a CDS’s behavior in clinical tasks. Continuous rule maintenance is necessary to
keep a CDS updated, useful, and at its full potential. Outdated rules can lead to missing alerts for preventive
services or even to a patient’s death due to outdated drug-drug interaction alerts. Currently, there are no
publicly accessible, reusable, generic, and machine-interpretable CDS rules for immunization schedules.
 Historically, CDS has been utilized successfully in large academic institutions. In the United States,
however, small practices provide healthcare services to a majority of the population, with the volume of
physician office visits at about 7.4 times that of hospital visits. In view of rapidly increasing EHR adoption rates
in the United States, CDS usage rates have reached 68.5% to 100% in office-based primary care settings,
indicating that CDS currently plays an important role in small practices. To be able to regularly update CDS
rules is critical to maintaining a CDS. CDS rule management and maintenance have been recognized as
challenging in large institutions. Thus, we anticipate that CDS rule management and maintenance will be an
obstacle for smaller primary care practices, especially those without in-house IT support.
 Ontology is the enabling technology of the Semantic Web. Ontology has the potential to improve the
interoperability, reusability, and sharability of ontology-based CDS rules, which will reduce duplicate efforts by
multiple stakeholders. We also propose to enable primary care providers, especially in settings without in-
house IT support, to manage and maintain CDS rules independently. The output of the investigation will be
beneficial to small primary care practices in the long term. Our efforts will contribute to more consistent
preventive services, including improved immunization recommendation rates for the large population served
by these practices. We propose to (1) build and validate an upper-level CDS ontology; (2) develop portable,
reusable, and machine-executable CDS rules based on ontology for CDC-recommended immunization
schedules; (3) develop implementation scripts for CDS rules; (4) implement CDS rules and evaluate their
reuse, use, and maintenance in simulated primary care settings, and (5) revise ontology, CDS rules, and
implementation scripts. The long-term goal is to achieve interoperable EHR across platforms seamlessly by
utilizing individuals’ immunization records. The experience gained from this proposed investigation will provide
a critical foundation for our long-term goal and help to solve “curly braces problem” in the reuse of CDS rules."
10884020,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia accounting for 60% to 80% of total
dementia cases and the sixth leading cause of death in the US. Over 25 million people are affected by the
disease and as the aging population increases, this number is expected to double by 2050. Although disease
modifying treatments for AD are now becoming available, they are not curative, and there remains a pressing
need for additional therapeutic strategies. Disruption of brain glycolytic metabolism is recognized as a hallmark
feature of AD that has deleterious consequences given the brain’s high metabolic rate. Ketone bodies are
alternative substrates that can be used by the brain to support mitochondrial oxidate metabolism. Mounting
evidence suggests that the AD brain may metabolize endogenous ketones derived from myelin lipids, leading to
derangements in lipid homeostasis and demyelination. Ketogenic diets or ketone drinks are now being
investigated as promising therapeutic strategies in the AD continuum to meet brain energy requirements and to
maintain lipid homeostasis. However, a major challenge in the development, validation, and optimization of
ketone therapies in AD is the lack of robust non-invasive tool to probe the metabolic fate of lipids and ketone
bodies in the human brain. Our preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of using deuterium magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (DMRS) with deuterium labeled precursors to directly characterize and quantify ketone
metabolism in the brain. In addition, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) based MRI offers the potential of
measuring changes in myelin/lipid integrity with high sensitivity.
 We propose to further develop and optimize DMRS for tracking glucose and ketone metabolism and NOE
MRI for studying brain lipids with a goal to probe initiating mechanisms underlying brain metabolic derangements
in AD. Specifically, we will first establish the precision of the methods in measuring glucose and ketone
metabolism and brain lipids in AD pathology. Then, we will perform longitudinal DMRS and NOE MRI in AD
mouse models (APP-KI, AD-APP-KI) that closely recapitulate human AD to determine the onset and progression
of changes in ketone and lipid metabolism and their association with the changes in immunohistochemical
measures of myelin, lipids and other hallmark features of AD. Successful completion of the proposed project will
lead to: (i) new mechanistic insights about the critical role of lipid catabolism and ketone metabolism in the
initiating stages of AD onset and progression (ii) validated imaging biomarkers that can measure changes in
ketone metabolism and lipid integrity in AD disease progression and its treatment with ketone supplementation,
and (iii) noninvasive and clinically translatable biomarkers that can be used to identify and longitudinally evaluate
disease targets and disease modifying ketone therapies, thereby contributing to enhanced patient care."

The Proteomics Shared Resource (P-SR) is focused on fostering high-impact cancer-relevant research by
providing SCI members with access to state-of-the-art, user-friendly mass spectrometry-based resources and
expertise. The P-SR operates 15 mass spectrometer systems that serve ~60 SCI researchers annually.
Research support goals are accomplished via the following technical capabilities (1) full-service research
partnership from experiment design through sample preparation and mass spectrometric analysis to data
analysis; (2) broad-spectrum proteomic support from pilot discovery through complex quantitative assays; (3)
customizable quantitative small molecule and clinical scale proteomic assays, taking advantage of modern
advances in multiplexing and targeted techniques; (4) intact protein characterization, including antibodies and
antibody-drug conjugates; (5) open access walk-up instrumentation and hands-on experience; and (6) online
and in-person education, training, and network-building opportunities. These technical capabilities are
foundational to numerous scientific areas, such as (1) discovering relevant molecular targets in cancer; (2)
providing accurate, orthogonal means of validating research findings from genomic and transcriptomic analyses
at the protein level; (3) supporting cancer drug discovery efforts with pharmacokinetics and metabolism analytics;
and (4) investigating biological pathways and signaling mechanisms relevant to cancer, both for target and
biomarker discovery.
Since the last review, the P-SR has continued to acquire new high-end instrumentation, including a Thermo
Scientific Q Exactive HF-X and a Waters Xevo TQ-XS. Members of all programs use the P-SR, with the heaviest
use coming from the Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapeutics programs. In 2020, 41%

annual budget of the P-SR is $1,547,560, yet the CCSG request is $70,495. Accordingly, the P-SR leverages
extensive institutional support and seeks only 5% from CCSG funds."
10887451,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the Tissue Procurement Shared Resource (TP-SR) is to procure and provide human
tissue specimens to Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) members to support their cancer-relevant research. TP-SR
activities and services include collecting and banking freshly-frozen tumor and normal tissue from excess
surgical material and from an autopsy, providing fresh tumor tissue for viable cell studies, processing and banking
blood specimens from cancer patients, maintaining a tissue database with links to clinicopathological data,
providing histological staining and pathological review services, coordinating patient consent, and assuring
regulatory compliance. As a centralized shared resource, the TP-SR adds value through experience, efficiency,
standardization, accountability, protection of patient confidentially, and timely completion of the research. From
2015 to 2020, the TP-SR consented over 11,000 patients, using universal consent and provided over 8,000
tissue and blood specimens to support cutting-edge cancer research in diverse areas, including cancer
genomics, cancer stem, cells, and molecular imaging. The TP-SR also provides a data feed to the Stanford
Cancer Institute Research Database (SCIRDB) to enable researchers to access data integration from many
sources, including EPIC EHR, STARR, specialized databases in surgical pathology, and radiation oncology, and
the Stanford Cancer Registry. The following are some of the TP-SR achievements. (1) The TP-SR established
a collaboration with the Human Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (HIMC-SR), enabling obtaining single-cell
suspensions of freshly procured surgical specimens. Over 300 fresh tissue specimens were processed in this
way, fulfilling increasing demands for specimens that can be used for Immunoassays, CyTOF, flow cytometry,
and genomic assays. (2) The TP-SR started providing consenting support and tissue collections for NCI’s Human
Cancer Models Initiative. To date, the TP-SR has provided tissue and blood samples from more than 120 patients
to this project. (3) The TP-SR started the process of merging patient consenting efforts with the Precision Health
Biobank at Stanford. This initiative enables the TP-SR to capture more patients and eases the consenting burden
of individual patients. (4) The TP-SR established a new protocol for electronic patient consenting via iPad—a
joint effort with the Precision Health Biobank, which will allow for the consenting of a broader range of patients
and improve the opportunity for clinic-based consenting.
Members of all programs regularly use the TP-SR, with the heaviest use coming from the Cancer Biology and
Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapeutics programs. In 2020, 80% of users were SCI investigators. The TP-
SR contributed to 40 cancer-focused publications (18 high-impact). The annual budget of the TP-SR is $787,997,
yet the CCSG request is $248,725. Accordingly, the TB-SR leverages institutional support and seeks 32% from
CCSG funds."
10887464,"PROJECT SUMMARY – VDDRC ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The overarching goal of the Administrative Core is to support the continuing development of the
VDDRC Research Base and to ensure responsiveness of the Research Cores to the needs of
VDDRC members and Pilot Project grant recipients. The administrative and scientific leadership of the
VDDRC is provided by the Director, Richard Peek, and the Associate Directors, Naji Abumrad and Keith
Wilson, and is augmented by the Scientific Advisory Board, composed of renowned internal and external
investigators, and by the Executive Committee, which is comprised of the Director, Associate Directors,
Core Directors, and Program Leaders. Two 0.5 FTE administrative assistants provide the necessary
support for day-to-day financial management and operations of the VDDRC. The Administrative Core
supports a Biostatistical Program directed by Dr. Tatsuki Koyama to assist pilot project applicants and
recipients as well as VDDRC members in clinical and basic research study design, data analysis, and
database management. An Enrichment Program co-directed by Dr. Abumrad, fosters new investigation
in digestive diseases research by supporting prominent scientists to present research seminars at
Vanderbilt, enhancing core utilization by addressing member research needs, and through an annual
retreat. The seminar series and the retreat provide opportunities for collaboration through scientific and
technical interactions between members and Core Directors. The Enrichment Program also supports
acquisition of new skills through the Enrichment Training (mini-sabbatical) Program. To train the next
generation of GI researchers, we created the VDDRC Academy of Investigators, a program in which
junior investigators acquire important career development tools. This component is directed by Dr.
Alyssa Hasty and co-directed by Dr. Lori Coburn, and will continue to receive $125,000 from Vanderbilt
over the next 5 years. The Academy will now oversee a new VDDRC Diversity Initiative supported by
both NIDDK and Vanderbilt with an overall goal of attracting, nurturing, and retaining underrepresented
minority investigators in digestive diseases research. The Administrative Core oversees the Pilot and
Feasibility Project Program, which has invested >$1.3M into investigator-initiated research in the
current funding period and is directed by Dr. Wilson. This program is designed to attract new and
seasoned investigators to pursue digestive diseases research and receives an additional $100,000
annually from Vanderbilt. New partnerships with Vanderbilt Centers have now been established to co-fund
additional content appropriate Pilots. Finally, there is now a new institutional commitment of $125,000 to
support an innovative Complementary Awards Program to provide funding to VDDRC members for non-
VDDRC Core services."
10887466,"PROJECT SUMMARY: VDDRC Cell Imaging Core
The Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Research Center (VDDRC) Cell Imaging Core, operated by the Cell Imaging
Shared Resource (CISR), ensures that VDDRC-affiliated investigators have full access to state-of-the-art
imaging equipment and expert technical support to conduct sophisticated microscopy and analysis of digestive
disease tissue and samples. By utilizing a large, well-established facility, the VDDRC Cell Imaging Core provides
high levels of quality control, a dedicated, expert staff and a significant economy of scale for services that would
be difficult (if not impossible) for individual investigators to establish and support. This organizational structure
fits well with the centralized approach to prevent needless duplication of scientific resources within federally
funded research centers, enabling focused development of technology that serves VDDRC investigators. The
overall goal of the VDDRC Cell Imaging Core is to provide the full range of modern microscopy and digital
imaging capabilities and techniques to enable and accelerate digestive disease research at Vanderbilt through
three objectives: 1) acquire and maintain state-of-the art optical and EM imaging technology; 2) train, assist, and
encourage VDDRC-affiliated investigators to incorporate optical, EM, and in vivo imaging technologies into
their research; and 3) develop new imaging technologies that will be useful for digestive disease research.
VDDRC support reduces the net cost of imaging services to VDDRC investigators and has helped provide
financial stability essential to sustain historically high levels of service, which has been vital to the successful
acquisition of new instruments and services that support VDDRC researchers. During the current funding period,
investigators representing 63 separate VDDRC-affiliated laboratories have used all aspects of this Core,
leading to 154 peer-reviewed publications. Over the same time period, initiatives taken to obtain equipment
grants, combined with institutional contributions, have provided over $4.1M in new capital equipment for the
benefit of VDDRC investigators. This includes one commercial and two custom-built lightsheet microscopes, a
new confocal microscope, and significant upgrades to both light and electron microscopes. Currently, the
VDDRC Cell Imaging Core manages 18 light and electron microscopes valued in excess of $10M, including a
Nikon Center of Excellence. The Vanderbilt shared facilities system provides an efficient billing system, oversight
and governance for this Core at no extra cost to VDDRC members. The VDDRC Cell Imaging Core will continue
to be a critical component in Vanderbilt’s broad range of digestive disease research resources and will provide
essential services that support the research of VDDRC-affiliated investigators during the next funding cycle."
10887468,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Flow Cytometry Core
The Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Flow Cytometry Core (VDDFCC) is an established and highly utilized Core
supported by the VDDRC. It was developed in direct response to member requests and approved by the
Executive Committee and the Scientific Advisory Board with substantial institutional support provided by
Vanderbilt. This Core provides state-of-the-art equipment for analytical spectral flow cytometry, classical flow
cytometry, and cell sorting. To complement this technology, the VDDFCC provides expert consultation on
experimental design, optimization, and analysis along with a multi-tiered approach to a customizable training
program for VDDRC members. Sixty VDDRC members have benefitted from this Core over the current funding
period which led to 90 peer-reviewed original publications. The VDDFCC maintains 4 classical analytical
cytometers, 3 cell sorters and a spectral flow cytometer that has been acquired within the current funding period.
The spectral flow cytometer uses 48 channels for fluorescent detection, which allows VDDRC investigators to
maximize panel design for rare and critical samples. Training is accomplished through both group and individual
interactions to develop and maintain the highest proficiency with these technologies. Trained users have the
ability to utilize the analytical cytometers on a 24 hour/7 days a week basis, 365 days a year. VDDRC members
have also benefitted from collaborations between the VDDFCC and other VDDRC Cores such as the
Translational Analysis Core and the Cell Imaging Core, as well as institutional shared resources such as the
Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics Core (for single cell and single nucleus isolation and
RNASeq) to enhance their digestive disease research discoveries. Digestive disease research often requires
customized modification of instrumentation settings, configuration, and on rare occasions fabrication of
specialized parts to increase an instrument’s capability. The VDDFCC works closely with the instrument
manufacturers to facilitate these modifications. Specific recommendations for adipose tissue multicolor panel
design, isolation of nuclei from intestinal tract samples, and optimized conditions for sorting intestinal and gastric
organoids are just a few examples of digestive disease-specific services regularly provided by the VDDFCC to
VDDRC members. The VDDFCC has also implemented specific open-office hours exclusively available to
VDDRC members for the sole purpose of elevating and accomplishing digestive disease research at Vanderbilt.
As a shared resource, the VDDFCC offers access to technologies, services, and expertise to all VDDRC
members unattainable by most individual labs due to high costs and field-specific experience. In sum, the
overall strategy and goals of the VDDFCC are specifically guided by the needs of VDDRC members, which
consequently adds depth and impact to their studies, allowing this Core to function as a scientific catalyst for
new discoveries."
10887469,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Translational Analysis Core
The main objectives of the Translational Analysis Core are to provide VDDRC investigators with seamless
access to a well-coordinated suite of investigative modalities including molecular non-invasive small animal
imaging, large-scale digital archiving and quantitative analysis of histologic, immunohistochemical and
immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections, state-of-the art research immunohistochemistry, and
consultative services in interpretation of morphologic findings in animal models and human digestive diseases.
The Core has three components: the Preclinical Imaging Service led by Dr. Peterson, the Digital Histology
Service led by Dr. Goldenring, and the Tissue Morphology Service led by Drs. Piazuelo and Washington. In
the current funding period, Core services were utilized by 42 VDDRC members leading to 217 peer-reviewed
publications. The expansion and strategic realignment of this Core now provides VDDRC investigators the
opportunity to move nimbly from investigations utilizing non-invasive molecular imaging (Preclinical Imaging) and
histology (Tissue Morphology), often in tandem, in tractable model systems of digestive diseases to digitization
and state-of-the-art high throughput analysis of morphology-based findings (Digital Histology). Continually
expanding services include access to a variety of molecular imaging probes specifically tailored for imaging GI
disease in preclinical animal models, including NIR-based optical imaging reagents and translational imaging
compounds labeled with positron emitting isotopes (PET), and providing GI-focused digital imaging services.
The Preclinical Imaging Service will support all major small animal imaging modalities including optical,
SPECT, and PET methods for molecular imaging, as provided by the Center for Small Animal Imaging within the
Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science. The Tissue Morphology Service provides research
immunohistochemistry services for both human and animal gastrointestinal tissue. In addition, Dr. Washington,
the Core Director, and Dr. Piazuelo provide the necessary expertise for interpretation of histologic findings
obtained in these studies. The Digital Histology Service provides high resolution digital imaging of and
quantitative analysis methods for whole slides and TMA in brightfield and fluorescence, and works with the
Tissue Morphology Service to facilitate multiplexed immunohistochemistry. Collectively, this Core offers VDDRC
members a tightly knit compendium of services provided by leaders with a rich history of collaboration that are
designed to increase the breadth and depth of animal studies with human validation focused on digestive
diseases."
10887471,"PROJECT SUMMARY: VDDRC MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS) AND PROTEOMICS CORE
The MS/Proteomics Core provides cost-effective, state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise to
investigators in the Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Research Center (VDDRC). This core leverages the
expert personnel and cutting edge instrument facilities located in the Vanderbilt Mass Spectrometry
Research Center to provide specialized services to VDDRC members. This core will be used for
identification and quantification of small molecules, identification, characterization, and quantification of
proteins, and biomolecular tissue imaging and profiling. Fifty-eight VDDRC investigators have used the
core extensively during the current funding period for digestive disease-related projects leading to 73 peer-
reviewed original publications. Services used include: analytical method development, assistance with
experimental design, inductively coupled MS, multiplex quantitative proteomics with isotope tagging
methods, phosphoproteome characterization, identification of post-translational modifications, elemental
analysis by ICP-MS, molecular profiling, tissue imaging, and bioinformatics analysis. Core personnel
perform assays for investigators and provided a formalized training program to 45 trainees from
VDDRC Member laboratories on the theoretical and practical aspects of MS during the current funding
period. The small molecule/metabolite component of the Core is run as an open-access facility in which
users can choose to prepare their samples and operate the instruments. Proteomics samples are
submitted to the core for analysis by proteomics staff after consultations between the investigator and core
staff on the most appropriate experimental design, sample preparation and instrumental analysis methods.
Administrative staff monitor the use of the instrument facilities by investigators and prepare reports on
utilization for use by the Administrative Core. The core has 25 mass spectrometers available to users,
in addition to specialized instrumentation for advanced analyses. The Specific Aims of the Core are to:
1) Provide access to state-of-the-art mass spectrometry equipment for analysis of small molecule drugs
and endogenous metabolites (host and microbial), including targeted and discovery metabolomics, in an
open-access analytical facility; 2) Provide access to a state-of-the-art proteomics facility for identification,
characterization, and quantitation of proteins and whole proteomes in digestive disease-related samples;
3) Provide access to a pioneering imaging mass spectrometry facility for spatial localization of proteins,
peptides, lipids, metabolites, and drugs in GI tissues; 4) Provide professional guidance on experimental
design, development of analytical assays, and data interpretation; 5) Train users on digestive diseases
sample preparation, instrument operation, and data analysis; 6) Train users on bioinformatics analysis of
complex proteomic data; 7) Promote interactions between other VDDRC Cores to facilitate and enhance
the collaborative mission of the VDDRC research enterprise."
10887474,"PROJECT SUMMARY – VDDRC Pilot and Feasibility Program
The Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Program is an essential component of the Vanderbilt DDRC (VDDRC). It directly
supports overall VDDRC goals, which are to: 1) promote digestive diseases research in an integrative,
collaborative, supportive, inclusive, and multidisciplinary manner; 2) attract new investigators to the study of these
disorders; 3) enhance the innovative research capabilities of members; and 4) promote the career development of
junior investigators. Through the P/F Program, the VDDRC has developed a strong track record of recruiting highly
talented young investigators and established investigators that are new to digestive disease research, as well
as established GI investigators testing exciting new ideas. In the past 10 years, we have supported 53 P/F
recipients, with 26 of these in the past 5 years. Our number of awarded pilots and the total amount of
support provided is greatly enhanced by a commitment of $100,000/year from Vanderbilt, plus additional
funding available from the VDDRC Academy of Investigators, Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational
Research, and new initiatives with the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology and Inflammation, the
Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center. Over the past
two grant award cycles (years 11-20), P/F recipients have garnered $40,786,119 in Direct Cost funding
subsequent to their P/F awards, yielding a 32–fold return on investment of NIH funds. We have
demonstrated major benefits to the career development of PIs supported as Type N (New Investigators) in the
P/F program (75% of awardees in the past 10 years), including development of faculty as research leaders and
growth into academic leadership positions. The P/F Program has been directed since 2010 by Keith T. Wilson,
M.D., Professor of Medicine, and Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, and VDDRC Associate Director.
The Program provides an applicant-friendly environment in which P/F grant opportunities are widely circulated,
and candidates interact closely with the P/F Director to ensure that their projects meet VDDRC goals,
optimize use of VDDRC Cores, and follow NIH guidelines for rigor and reproducibility. The Specific Aims are:
1) To recruit talented Type N investigators without current or past independent NIH support to digestive disease
research, to provide a foundation for career development and future independent funding, including enrollment
in the VDDRC Academy of Investigators; 2) To recruit established investigators new to digestive disease
research (Type EN), with the goal of fostering collaborations and new directions that may lead to subsequent
related publications, projects, and research grants in the field; 3) To support established investigators (Type E)
in the digestive disease field in the pursuit of highly innovative, exciting new ideas that are a significant departure
from their previous work, and are likely to result in fruitful new investigations. The overall goal is enhanced
digestive disease-related research with transformative new ideas, catalyzed by P/F support, leading to
extensive interaction with Center members and activities."
10887476,"PROJECT SUMMARY – VDDRC ENRICHMENT
The Enrichment Program provides critical mechanisms to support the overall goals of the VDDRC via the
following Specific Aims: 1) To foster the scientific and professional career development and promote
diversity of members; 2) To expand research tools used by VDDRC members to pursue studies in the
realm of digestive disease; and 3) To extend the impact and disseminate knowledge gained from research
performed by VDDRC members. To achieve these goals, the VDDRC has incorporated several innovative
elements into the following Enrichment components: A) the Research Seminar Series; B) the Academy of
Investigators; C) the Enrichment Training (mini-sabbatical) Program; and D) the Annual Retreat. To
catalyze member scientific development and interactions, the VDDRC Research Seminar Series was
initiated in 2002. This series is a vehicle for prominent local, national, and international investigators to present
lectures related to topics within the VDDRC Research Domains. The breadth and depth of VDDRC scientific
impact has now been enhanced by new partnerships with multiple Vanderbilt Centers to co-sponsor
speakers. Institutional and endowed support over the current funding period ($50,000) also sponsored
complementary research lectures within the GI Division targeting the interests of VDDRC members. To train
the next generation of GI researchers, we created the VDDRC Academy of Investigators, a program in
which junior investigators acquire important career development tools. This component is directed by Dr.
Alyssa Hasty, a former VDDRC P & F recipient and Young Investigator Awardee, and co-directed by Dr. Lori
Coburn, a former P & F recipient, and will receive $125,000 from Vanderbilt over the next 5 years. The
Academy will now oversee a new VDDRC Diversity Initiative supported jointly by NIDDK and
Vanderbilt as a mechanism to attract trainees from diverse backgrounds into GI research. To provide
members with the opportunity to expand their research capabilities, the VDDRC Enrichment Training
(mini-sabbatical) Program supports members’ leaves to work in another laboratory for either the acquisition
of new techniques or to establish a new model related to digestive disease research. The annual VDDRC
Retreat is designed to disseminate research findings of our members and includes a symposium featuring
internal speakers and current P & F recipients, a keynote speaker, and a poster session (ePosters and
standard posters), which provides robust interactions among senior investigators, junior faculty, and trainees.
Vouchers for VDDRC Cores are awarded to the best posters as judged by Program leaders. Finally, the
VDDRC is a member of the newly minted Eastern Regional DDRCC Alliance, which is now funded by
NIDDK to develop a virtual seminar series and an exchange program focused on junior faculty and P & F
recipients as a means to promote career development."
10888559,"Project Summary / Abstract
 This application builds on the pioneering work conducted in my mentor’s laboratory exploring mechanisms
of neurological injury from glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurobehavioral
deficits in a translational model of brain injury from hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). As outlined in Aim 3 of
the parent R01 grant and in the description of future direction of the research, we propose to further test these
mechanisms of injury, specifically using the method of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism with ketamine
and the addition of antegrade cerebral perfusion in a model of HCA. By utilizing these two techniques, we aim
to discover if we can prolong the safe HCA time for complex aortic and congenital cardiac surgery. If successful
we will have identified evidence necessary to translate treatment to humans by dramatically reducing
neurological injury and improve outcomes in these patients.
 By identifying the underlying mechanisms of injury in the hippocampus and testing them in a pre-clinical
large animal model, the work proposed in this application will advance the field because there are no currently
available pharmacologic agents or operative techniques of cerebral perfusion that have been proven in
randomized trials to provide significant improvement to the current use of hypothermia. We propose the
following aims: 1) To determine the effect of ACP on the underlying mechanisms responsible for hippocampal
susceptibility and injury during HCA, (subaim 1) to determine the effect of ACP on blood flow to the
hippocampus using ASL during HCA, (subaim 2) to determine the effect of ACP on glutamate excitotoxicity
and mitochondrial dysfunction in HCA, and 2) to determine the synergistic effects of combining ACP +
ketamine, ACP + diazoxide, or ACP + diazoxide + ketamine during HCA with moderate hypothermia. This aim
will compare the effect of drug (ketamine or diazoxide or both) with or without ACP on neuroprotection in 18,
24 and 28 degrees (moderate hypothermia).
 Our multidisciplinary team includes a practicing cardiac surgeon who experiences the current challenges
when performing complex aortic surgery (Lawton), a practicing neurologist specializing in brain injury and
mitochondrial stress (Jantzie), a practicing neurosurgeon who specializes in brain injury (Robinson), a
neuroscientist with expertise in brain injury and mechanisms of neurorepair and microglial activation (Scafidi),
and a neuropathologist that specializes in neural cell death and mitochondrial pathobiology (Martin). Together,
we possess the expertise to research this complex topic and translate the findings to clinical practice.
 The proposed experiments provide a comprehensive approach to understanding the mechanisms of
neurological injury of the hippocampus due to HCA. The knowledge gained in this project has the potential to
provide meaningful recovery to hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease who
require cardiac surgery."

Humans display tremendous flexibility in their everyday behavior, adjusting it rapidly when appropriate (i.e.
adopting mask wearing after onset of Covid-19), but not when inappropriate (i.e. continuing to drive after
involvement in an unavoidable car accident). Recent work has highlighted the role that transient fluctuations in
arousal, thought to be mediated by activation of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC/NE) system, play in
behavioral adjustments. Increasing NE pharmacologically promotes behavioral updating in rodents and
peripheral measures of arousal, such as pupil diameter and P300 orienting response, provide a window into
the dynamics that underlie these behavioral adjustments in humans. A mechanistic understanding of these
processes could provide a valuable therapeutic target for a wide range of psychiatric disorders in which
behavioral flexibility is impaired. However, current theory falls short, in part because it fails to account for the
contextual nature of arousal: that heightened arousal reflects more behavioral adjustment in some settings or
individuals, but less in others. We believe that previous computational accounts of NE have likely failed to
explain heterogenous effects on behavior because they have ignored the neural representations on which NE
acts. Recent advances in computational neuroscience have highlighted the importance of neural
representations for efficient learning in complex environments, and provided tools to measure them. Building
on this work, we developed a computational model in which NE drives transitions in neural representation that
lead to behavioral adjustment when new representations persist in time (ie. after Covid), but reduce behavioral
adjustment when they do not (after a freak accident). We propose that representational dynamics evoked by
NE are not random, but instead are governed by assumptions about environmental structure, which differ
across settings and individuals, to produce heterogeneous effects of arousal on behavior. This idea could
facilitate personalized predictions for how NE manipulations would alter behavior, potentially enabling better
treatment of attention deficit and anxiety disorders. Achieving this goal would first require basic research
experiments to better characterize how and why arousal differentially relates to behavior across task contexts,
individuals, and learning. Here we conduct these basic research studies, first measuring arousal by proxy in
adversarial task structures (i.e. post-covid versus post-accident) to dissect the computational mechanisms
through which it modulates behavior. Next, we examine internal representations directly, using fMRI in a task
with ambiguous structure, to understand whether and how inter-individual differences in representational
structure give rise to inter-individual differences in behavior and its sensitivity to arousal. Finally, we extend our
existing computational model such that it can learn structure through experience and make individualized
predictions for behavior across a wide range of possible environments. We test these predictions, as well as
their relevance to various mental health constructs, in a large-scale online validation study."

Social and lifestyle interventions are a promising innovation for delaying the onset of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Extensive work has shown that
maintaining social connectedness through personal social networks (the group of family
members, friends, and other acquaintances in which individuals are socially embedded)
confers resilience to cognitive decline and AD. The current proposal uses an
interdisciplinary and multi-method approach to elucidate the mechanism by which this
occurs. To date, existing research has focused on the implications of social networks for
one neurocognitive pathway – general cognitive ability. The current proposal tests the
novel prediction that a different pathway – social cognitive function – is a key component
underlying the linkages between social networks, general cognitive function, and AD
resilience. Social cognitive function – the process by which people understand, store,
and apply information about others – is essential for successfully navigating social
interactions, and declines over the lifespan. The proposed work explores the prediction
that exercising social cognitive abilities through complex social interactions within their
personal social networks stimulates older adults’ general cognitive function, thereby
improving their resilience. In Aim 1, we examine the relationship between older adults’
social networks and their social cognitive function, as well as the possibility that having
better social cognitive function may be protective for general cognitive function. Aim 2
uses a novel neuroimaging approach to identify the neurobiological mechanisms that
give rise to the relationship between social networks and social cognitive function.
Finally, Aim 3 uses a longitudinal design to gain insight into the causal relationship
between social network dynamics, social cognitive decline, and general cognitive
decline. The proposed study is interdisciplinary, combining cutting-edge methods
from the social and biomedical sciences, and leveraging the resources of funded
centers for AD, neuroimaging, and network science. The long-term goal of this project
is to improve the clinical course of AD, and reduce the prevalence and public health
impact of dementia. By increasing our understanding of the links between biological
and social processes, this project may help identify novel targets for intervention to
reduce the burden of AD on individuals, families, and the health care system."

Despite the number of people affected each year by persistent pain and poorly healed fractures after nonfatal
traumatic and surgical injury it remains unclear what are the key components of the profound multicellular
response to injury and how they can be manipulated to improve outcomes. In particular, peripheral injury
mobilizes the immune system to resolve tissue damage, however, sustained immune activation can be
detrimental and contribute to delayed healing. Myeloid-lineage cells are instrumental in the innate immune
response to injury- peripherally, as macrophages, and centrally, as yolk sac-derived microglia. Nevertheless, the
temporal and compartment-specific contributions of myeloid-lineage cells to bone healing, perioperative pain
and surgical recovery have yet to be elucidated. Precise manipulation of these myeloid-lineage cells to establish
causation is not possible in humans. To identify cellular and molecular targets for improving recovery we will
therefore take advantage of a clinically informed mouse model of orthopaedic injury. Our central hypothesis is
that there is a critical period during which myeloid-lineage cell involvement is crucial for proper recovery from
injury; however, prolonged activation, marked by cytokine release and loss of homeostatic functions, can
contribute to pain and impaired bone healing ultimately increasing the risk for long-term disability. To pursue this
fundamental work, we will use a combination of molecular and whole organism approaches in which we have
significant expertise including mouse models of complex orthopaedic trauma, affective-motivational readouts of
persistent pain and functional impairment, specific transgenic manipulations and longitudinal imaging of bone
and CNS tissues. In particular, this convergence of capabilities uniquely positions us to answer the following key
knowledge gaps: 1) The innate immune response is instrumental to recovery, but can its dysfunction be
monitored in vivo to identify at risk individuals? 2) What specific molecular signatures of activated myeloid-
lineage cells can be targeted peripherally and centrally to improve outcomes? 3) Is the myeloid-lineage response
to peripheral injury evolutionarily conserved and therefore translationally relevant? The proposed research builds
on our previous work in a mouse model of chronic pain in which we showed that: 1) Myeloid-targeted positron
emission tomography ligands can track dysfunctional innate immune activation, 2) Attenuation of macrophage
and microglial activation can improve persistent pain, 3) New markers can be used to distinguish infiltrating
macrophages from resident microglia in the spinal cord thus clarifying their unique contributions. Ultimately,
these studies will establish how myeloid-lineage cells may be the initial cellular link between peripheral injury,
poor bone healing and severe acute pain. Successful completion of the proposed studies will enhance our
understanding of compartment-specific macrophage and microglia effects on healing after injury, identify cell-
specific targets for intervention, and clarify when and in whom such treatments will provide the most benefit."

 The human gut microbiome field lags behind other microbial ecology fields in its application of single cell resolved
techniques capable of revealing the function of microbes at (close to) in situ conditions. By building on my lab’s expertise
in working with sample types that are taxonomically, functionally, and structurally more complex than the gut
microbiome by most metrics, I propose to transform the human gut microbiome field by catapulting it into the era
of single cell ecophysiology investigations. Rather than growing individual members of the gut microbiome in
isolation or trying to extrapolate findings from bulk omics approaches that destroy spatial information, we will study
gut microorganisms at single cell resolution where they actually live, as members of spatially structured and
metabolically interdependent ecosystems. We will investigate the functional activity and metabolic diversity of microbes
in mucosal biopsy samples from the human gastrointestinal tract using several cutting-edge technologies that are currently
not used or are underutilized in the field. Substrate analog probing and bioorthogonal labeling, in combination with
fluorescence in situ hybridization, will be used to study which cells synthesize new DNA, proteins, lipids, or
peptidoglycan under specific physicochemical conditions. These methods will also be combined with fluorescence
activated cell sorting to separate cells that change their metabolic activity in response to substrate amendment. Sorted
cells will be sequenced via shotgun metagenomics, which will provide a direct link between the active cells’ in
situ phenotype and genotype. Non-destructive Raman microspectroscopy, in combination with stable isotope
probing, will be used to study the biochemistry and substrate utilization of specific members of the human gut
microbiome. This will allow us to test whether predictions about growth substrates generated in previous metagenomics
and cultivation driven studies are truly reflective of how these microbes live in the human gut. Last, we will develop
novel correlative microscopy approaches that will integrate information from a diversity of imaging sources to visualize
microbes, their chemical composition, and gene expression activity directly in their native orientation in the gut.
Specifically, we will employ fluorescence and electron microscopy, Raman based chemical imaging, and energy-
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy on embedded and thin-sectioned mucosal samples."
10888341,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adolescent depression and cannabis use are concurrent major public health concerns, and this comorbidity
has been associated with long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. However, there has been sparse
research in this area, as most neuroimaging studies in adolescent depression exclude cannabis users. We seek
to address this gap based on converging evidence that: 1) Reward dysfunction contributes to maintenance and
progression of depression in adolescents; 2) Reward dysfunction is a heterogenous construct involving deficits
in diverse cognitive processes, including reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction error; 3) These deficits
entail distinct neural mechanisms that can be studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); 4) The
major psychoactive agent in cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exerts its effects through modulation of
the cortico-striatal reward system; and 5) Cannabis use may result in temporary relief of mood and anxiety
symptoms while inducing potentially deleterious long-term neural reward alterations. We documented that
anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse depression
outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality, in adolescents. Similarly, using resting-state fMRI, we found that
altered striatal intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the prefrontal cortex was associated with anhedonia
severity in depressed adolescents. Further, using the reward flanker task (RFT), we found that adolescents with
diverse mood and anxiety symptoms showed weaker striatal activation during reward anticipation than healthy
controls, while stronger activation in the anterior cingulate cortex predicted worse higher levels of anhedonia at
two-year follow-up. We therefore propose a 2×2 cross-sectional study to test the overall hypothesis that comorbid
cannabis use in adolescent depression is associated with more severe neural reward deficits and clinical
symptoms. Participants will comprise 30 depressed cannabis users, 30 depressed cannabis non-users, 30 non-
depressed cannabis users, and 30 healthy controls, all ages 14-18 (Tanner stage ≥ 4) and psychotropic-
medication-free. Using resting-state and RFT task fMRI, we predict that comorbid cannabis use and depression
will be associated with more pronounced deficits in reward anticipation (Aim 1) and alterations in cortico-striatal
iFC (Aim 2) than depression alone. Further analyses (Exploratory Aims) will assess the relationships between
cannabis use frequency and activation during reward anticipation, cortico-striatal iFC, and symptom severity."
10888343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Progressive disorders of airway protection, such as swallowing disorders (dysphagia) and cough disorders
(dystussia), are highly prevalent in PD and have significant negative implications for health and quality of life. In
fact, aspiration pneumonia, commonly associated with dysphagia/dystussia, is a leading cause of death in PD.
Despite this, there is currently no established standard of care for the treatment of airway protective disorders in
this population. Even more critically, approximately 40% of individuals with PD in the United States do not access
rehabilitation services or receive specialized care for these potentially life-threatening airway protective deficits.
Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) and Cough Skill Training (CST) have been found to improve airway
protective disorders in PD and be feasible via telehealth. However, a significant clinical-research gap remains in
that it has not been demonstrated that clinical outcomes are comparable (non-inferior) when these treatments
are delivered via telehealth versus in-person. This gap limits access to these important services with detrimental
effects to health and quality of life. The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve the health outcomes
of individuals with PD, specifically as they relate to airway protective dysfunction. The objective of this application
is to pair EMST + CST – and compare clinical and patient-centered outcomes when conducted in-person versus
via telehealth in the short- and the long-term. Also, we will assess the role of specific patient burden factors and
resultant treatment adherence on clinical outcomes. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: 1) Compare clinical
and patient-centered outcomes following four weeks of intensive in-person vs. telehealth EMST+CST treatment
in persons with PD, 2) Compare clinical and patient-centered outcomes from a long-term EMST+CST
maintenance program offered in-person vs. via telehealth in persons with PD, and 3) Identify the role of specific
patient burden factors (i.e., geographic location, cognitive function, disease severity, and caregiver burden) on
treatment adherence in the short- and long-term and the influence of treatment adherence on clinical outcomes.
We will achieve these aims by conducting a two-arm, two site, randomized clinical trial in 120 people with PD
comparing in-person vs. telehealth EMST+CST treatment after a four-week intensive period (aim1) and after a
one year maintenance treatment period (with assessments at six and 12 months – aim 2). We anticipate our
findings will result in immediately translatable clinical deliverables that will have broad impact for reduced burden
and improved accessibility of treatment. Further, these findings will inform our future studies investigating these
treatments and service delivery models on long-term outcomes (i.e., aspiration pneumonia, hospitalization,
death), accessibility, and healthcare costs."
10887314,"Title: Identification of splice variant derived neo-antigens in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
as targets for tumor vaccine therapy
Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were recently FDA approved for first line treatment of recurrent and
metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, response rates to ICI in HNSCC are
less than 20%. Tumor specific neoantigens predict response to ICI therapy, and these immunogenic
neoantigens represent ideal targets for vaccines to enhance ICI response. Alternative splicing events, which
are present and functionally active in HNSCC, represent an understudied source of tumor-specific protein
diversity and novel neoantigens. The goal of this work is to identify the potential for splice variant derived
neoantigens to elicit an immune response and serve as targets for tumor vaccine development. Using an
established computational pipeline, splice variant derived peptides will be predicted and prioritized. Then an
immunocompetent murine model of oral cancer will be utilized to evaluate the functional immunogenicity of
aberrant splicing variants. Splicing variant products that are able to elicit an immune response will then be
incorporated into a vaccine and evaluated for the ability to enhance response of oral cancer to immune
checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, immune response to splice variant derived human neoantigens will be evaluated
in oral cancer patients to establish the role for translation of such therapies to the clinic. The proposed work
has the potential to transform the landscape of tumor neoantigens in HNSCC to include previously
unrecognized splicing variants derived neoantigens. These splice variants occur at a higher prevalence than
somatic mutations, generate highly immunogenic protein products with more extensive sequence alteration
than mutations, and their derivative neoantigens represent ideal targets for tumor vaccine development. While
this work is focused in oral cancer, the role of splice variants on anti-tumor immunity can be expanded to
impact other heterogeneous solid tumors."

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are generally incurable hematologic
malignancies, originating from aberrant hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSPC). These
diseases occur mainly in the elderly and are preceded by an often-unrecognized precancerous phase, which
can last for years and is hallmarked by a progressively changing HSPC compartment. These molecularly and
functionally diverging stem cells, harbor a higher propensity to undergo malignant transformation. Mechanisms
that separate the healthy aging process from cancer evolution are incompletely resolved. This gap in our
knowledge poses a significant challenge for the development of curative therapies for myeloid malignancies for
which overall cure rates have remained below 30% over the last decades.
Our study will investigate the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a highly selective subtype of
autophagy, which we recently demonstrated to confer key roles in stress mitigation in and metabolic control of
HSPC. Contrary to macroautophagy, CMA specifically degrades proteins containing defined recognition motifs
(“KFERQ”, and variants), and maintains integrity and proper function of many cell types during chronic stress
and aging. CMA declines in and critically contributes to several age-associated pathologies, yet its role in
leukemogenesis and cancer stem cell evolution is unknown. Using new genetic mouse models, we have
obtained exciting preliminary data strongly suggesting that loss of CMA drives expansion of HSPC bearing gene
lesions found in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP); yet upon malignant transformation, CMA
is critically needed in and likely selected for in LSC. For this study, we hypothesize that CMA enables LSC
maintenance through governing metabolic adaptation to amino acid starvation, licensing increase of fatty acid
production through upregulation of coenzyme A synthesis from lysosomal cysteine.
We will utilize a complementary model set consisting of genetic mouse models, human cell lines and primary
patient-derived cells for the study of (i) CMA activation patterns in CHIP-HSPC and LSC (leveraging a CMA
reporter mouse and lentiviral CMA biosensors for primary human cells), (ii) molecular and (iii) functional
consequences of CMA inactivation and stimulation.
Our study will provide new insights into a molecular mechanism declining during aging and predisposing adult
tissue-specific stem cells to malignant transformation, which will have important implications for the development
of new therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in myeloid malignancies, and possibly other stem cell-
derived cancers."
10889440,"“Substance of Change: Evaluation of Web-Based Training for Mentors and Staff Serving Youth
Impacted by Substance Misuse”
Approximately 1.6 million youth between the ages of 12-17 years old had a substance use disorder in the past
year. Another 8.3 million youth have lived with a parent who misused alcohol or drugs within the last year.
Substance misuse-affected youth (SMAY) are at heightened risk for conduct problems such as delinquency and
aggression, risky sexual behavior, truancy, and poor grades. Mentoring programs regularly serve SMAY due to
findings suggesting positive outcomes for these youth associated with being in a mentoring relationship.
Training of mentors and professional development of staff has been shown to be related to better quality and
longer-lasting mentoring relationships and more positive youth outcomes, in general; however, no evidence-
based, asynchronous, web-based, training programs have been located for mentoring programs serving SMAY.
The purpose of this project is to evaluate Substance of Change: Building Assets in Mentees Affected by
Substance Misuse (SOC), an interactive, multimedia, web–based, asynchronous training for mentors and staff
working with SMAY to determine its effects on mentor and staff outcomes. The content of the training course
builds upon content delivered in foundational, core pre-match mentor training and adds information and skills
related to the unique issues associated with mentoring SMAY. SOC includes content related to avoiding misuse
of drugs, coping with stress in a healthy way, and employing a strengths-based, asset-building approach to
mentoring vulnerable youth. Though the course addresses substance misuse generally, particular focus is paid
to avoiding opioid misuse. Given the enhanced skills needed by mentors and staff, the training will
acknowledge the ongoing needs and challenges that can emerge across the life cycle of the mentoring
relationship. As part of the current project, SOC will be expanded to add booster content to the course. After
boosters are created, four studies will be conducted. The first is a randomized controlled trial evaluation study
with mentors to examine the effectiveness of the training for improving mentors’ knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors related to mentoring SMAY. The second study is a randomized controlled trial exploratory evaluation
study with mentoring program staff members to assess staff members’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors
related to providing support to matches that include SMAY. The third study is a qualitative interview study
with mentors to examine the applicability and usefulness of the training. The fourth study is a qualitative
interview study with mentoring program staff members to examine the factors influencing adoption of the
training for mentoring programs. Results from this work will inform a future large-scale randomized controlled
trial evaluation of SOC to determine its effectiveness on youth outcomes, including reducing mentees’
substance misuse and intention to use substance, and improving mentees’ healthy coping strategies."

Members of the Armed Services deployed in the Middle East were exposed to numerous environmental
toxicants, including emissions from open-air burn pits. Burn pits are designated areas on military sites for open
air combustion of trash and other unwanted items. Large amounts of waste are destroyed through burn pits.
The contents of burn pits are highly variable temporally within the same location and between locations, but at
least three components are present in most; plastics, military plywood and military cardboard. Burn pits contain
both smoldering and flaming combustion. In collaboration with colleagues at the EPA, we utilize a controlled
furnace to burn plastics and military plywood and cardboard at either smoldering or flaming temperatures. These
three components are burned either individually or as a mixture, and the complex combustion products are
analyzed in detail. Our studies show that single exposures of flaming combustion products of any component
or the mixture induce lung inflammation, whereas smoldering combustion products do not. Repeated exposure
to flaming combustion products of the mixture, which commonly occurs among military personnel, induce a small
increase in neutrophils compared to a single exposure when both were studied 24 hours after the final exposure,
but no change in lung injury. Importantly, the nature of the immune response changes after repeated exposures,
as measured both by mRNA of selected immune mediators and by multiplex assay of cytokines, chemokines
and other mediators. Unbiased analysis of the proteome present in the BAL fluid also reveals differences
between single and multiple exposures. Evidence of a change in the lung microenvironment toward Th1 immune
responses and a greater anti-oxidant capacity is present. The proposed study thus tests the hypothesis that the
lung's response to multiple exposures takes on a different nature than to a single exposure, reflecting adaptation
and resiliency by the lungs. Studies proposed in Aim 1 will characterize both the immune cell infiltrate in
bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue and the lung injury following a single exposure and multiple exposures
to burn pit combustion products. Mice will receive either a single exposure or five or ten exposures, 2 or 3 days
apart, of either combustion products of the mixture or saline (controls) and will be studied at 24 hours after the
final exposure. The number of epithelial and immune cells (neutrophils, macrophage subpopulations, T and B
lymphocytes, NK cells and their activation states) will be measured using flow cytometry. Markers of acute
inflammation, Th1 immune responses, anti-oxidant capacity, and lung injury and repair will be measured.
Studies in Aim 2 will determine the transcriptomes of lung bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, neutrophils and
macrophage subpopulations following single compared to multiple exposures to burn pit combustion products.
These studies will use single cell RNAseq/CITE-seq of lung digests obtained 24 hours after the single or the fifth
exposure. Thus, studies will provide an understanding of the lungs' response to burn pit combustion products
experienced by members of our Armed Services and may suggest interventions to be pursued."

Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI; formerly known as functional abdominal pain disorders) like irritable
bowel syndrome are highly prevalent worldwide in children and adults. They are associated with significant
morbidity and incur substantial healthcare costs. The etiology of DGBI is multifactorial as described by the
biopsychosocial model. Psychological distress, including anxiety and depression, is highly associated with DGBI,
and cognitive behavioral therapy and its variant guided imagery therapy (GIT) are efficacious first-line treatments
per experts and clinical guidelines. Unfortunately, individual and systemic barriers often impede regular in-person
therapy visits. Alternatively, researchers have demonstrated that remotely delivered CBT and GIT via compact
discs and websites are efficacious, which led to the development of a K23-supported, patient-centered guided
imagery therapy mobile application (GIT App). However, our current K23 research nor the medical literature
inform best practices for implementing such a therapeutic App in pediatric clinics. Further, our preliminary data
shows that our clinicians infrequently refer children with DGBI to any psychological therapy. This proposal aims
to identify our clinic personnel’s perceived implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators) for rolling
out the GIT App within our pediatric clinics. To address this known barrier and discover unforeseen barriers and
inherent facilitators possibly affecting the implementation process, this proposal will solicit our clinic personnel’s
perspectives of these factors to inform a future GIT App implementation strategy that can guide clinic personnel
activities necessary to promote the implementation of the GIT App in this setting. Guided by the theory of
Organizational Readiness for Change and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will
use qualitative and quantitative research methods to (1) assess our clinicians' perspectives about the infrequent
referral of patients with DGBI to psychological therapy and (2) identify perceived barriers and facilitators to the
implementation of the GIT App intervention in our pediatric clinics. Aim 1 will involve qualitative interviews with
clinicians to better understand their views on barriers to referral. For Aim 2, we will use mixed-methods research
by first quantitatively assessing clinic personnel’s organizational readiness for implementing the GIT App
intervention within our pediatrics clinics by using the validated Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment
(ORCA) instrument. Then we will conduct qualitative interviews with the same clinic personnel who have highest
and lowest ORCA readiness scores and capture their respective perspectives about perceived barriers and
facilitators affecting GIT App intervention implementation. The combined results of Aims 1 and 2 will inform a
GIT App implementation strategy for our pediatric clinics that can be evaluated in a future hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial. Results from the current study is likely to be applicable to implementing other therapeutic
mobile apps within clinics and also help initiate a sea change in the care delivery of children with DGBI."

The long-term goal of this project is to establish the molecular pathway used by Neuromedin-U (NMU) in the
negative regulation of bone formation. This is significant since studies in mice indicate NMU negatively regulates
bone formation in vivo, making the NMU pathway a potential therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis, a
disease that places individuals at enhanced risk for fracture, disability, and death. Hospitalizations for
osteoporotic fracture exceeds those for heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer, and direct medical costs for
osteoporosis in the US are estimated to be approximately $20 billion. Despite this, there are limited treatment
options for osteoporosis, particularly for long-term management of this chronic condition, and the available
pharmacological therapies have significant drawbacks. Consequently, there is an urgent need for developing
new therapeutic approaches for treating osteoporosis. The proposed R03 will follow a novel line of investigation
to examine the role of the NMU pathway in the restriction of bone formation. Work by this research team and
others demonstrates that endogenous NMU suppresses osteoblast differentiation and function; however, a poor
understanding of the molecular pathway utilized by NMU to suppress bone formation restricts translational
opportunities at present. This R03 proposal seeks to address this limitation by determining the functional role of
NMU Receptor 2 (NMUR2) in the skeleton in vivo and to test the hypothesis that NMUR2 is required for NMU-
mediated suppression of bone formation. Using a novel mouse line in which Nmur2 expression is lost in the
appendicular skeleton, we will examine the role of NMUR2 through quantification of bone mass, quantitative
histological analyses, serum markers of bone turnover, and high-throughput signaling arrays for examining
hundreds of potential effectors downstream of NMUR2 in bone. This project is an excellent fit for the goals of the
R03 funding mechanism in that 1) it provides a foundation for future projects in a novel line of investigation; 2) it

Eight out of ten children with mitochondrial disorders die before three years of age. The most critical
predicting factor of such a fatal outcome is the age of disease onset. Children who manifest the first symptoms
during the neonatal or early infantile periods have a ten times higher risk of dying than those who present later.
Despite recent advances in prenatal diagnosis, there are no approved treatments for mitochondrial diseases
during pregnancy. As a result, most children are born with severe malformations, mainly of the nervous
system, rendering most postnatal therapies ineffective. We have identified a new drug to support
intermediary metabolism during pregnancy and postnatal periods in a mouse model of one of the most common
human mitochondrial diseases: pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHD). Approximately 80% of babies with
PDHD are born with structural defects of the brain, including cortical dysplasia, hypoplasia of the corpus
callosum, and cerebellar atrophy, resulting in severe intellectual disability, intractable seizures, and short
lifespan. To identify this treatment, we tracked glucose metabolism in vivo in a mouse model of PDHD to
ascertain the metabolic pathways that are amenable to treatment. We found that the Krebs cycle is a
critical pathway. In contrast to the control brain, the activity of the Krebs cycle is partially sustained by the
incorporation of non-glucose-derived substrates at several entry points throughout the cycle. A main entry point
is succinyl-CoA. A singular characteristic of succinyl-CoA and its precursors is that they provide net carbons to
replace Krebs cycle intermediates that engage in biosynthesis. This finding is important because current
treatments for PDHD do not support biosynthesis and the developmental processes that depend on it, including
cell proliferation, migration, and myelination. We hypothesize that a specific precursor of succinyl-CoA could
represent a new therapeutic strategy to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in this condition. To test this
hypothesis, two independent aims are proposed: 1) To analyze how a specific succinyl-CoA precursor is
metabolized in the PDHD brain; 2) To evaluate its therapeutic impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the
PDHD mouse model. The research proposed is significant because it aims to prevent, for the first time,
neurodevelopmental deficits in PDHD and, by virtue, to improve the quality of life and life expectancy in this
condition. This proposal is innovative because it will test a new drug to treat PDHD as early as the prenatal
stages. Our preliminary data indicate that the administration of this drug is safe during pregnancy in mice.
Positive results from these studies may have important implications for patient care because the drug is already
FDA-approved for human use and can be applied to other metabolic conditions in which brain biosynthesis is
impaired."

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles which support the metabolic needs of neurons across their entire
lifetime. Previous research has sought to define the regulation of mitochondrial transport as dependent on the
activity of the neuron, including changes in energy demand. However, previous studies and unpublished data
from the Barnhart lab show mitochondrial motility is not dependent on neuronal activity. Given defects in
mitochondrial transport have been implicated with neurodegeneration, the goal of this research is to elucidate
the fundamental role of mitochondrial transport in maintaining healthy and functional neurons. I propose to
define both in vivo mitochondrial localization across the neuron and contributions of mitochondrial motility in
the function of the mitochondria in neurons. To define mitochondrial transport and function in vivo, I will use
the Drosophila melanogaster visual system with live cell imaging using genetically encoded reporters of
mitochondrial health and neuronal function. In Aim 1, I will use confocal microscopy, immunostaining and
EM reconstructions to define the relationship between mitochondrial motility, mitochondrial distribution
patterns and neuronal architecture. This aim will evaluate the relationship between neuronal structure and
overall mitochondrial localization. In Aim 2, I will use mitochondrial perturbations to assess how
mitochondrial motility affects mitochondrial health and neuronal function in vivo. These studies will define the
regulation and functional relevance of mitochondrial motility in neurons, which paves the way towards future
studies on the role of mitochondrial transport defects in disease, including in neurodegeneration."

Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest of the five species of malaria parasites that infect humans. Annually,
there are over 200 million symptomatic cases of falciparum malaria and over 400,000 deaths – the majority of
which occur in African children under the age of five. The two major interventions that have had an effect on
reducing malaria prevalence over the past twenty years are mosquito control and use of antimalarial drugs. The
most important class of drugs in this effort has been the artemisinin derivatives, which since 2005 have been
deployed as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) only, in order to reduce the probability of emergence and
spread of artemisinin-resistant genotypes. Despite these efforts, artemisinin resistance did emerge, and we are
now facing the dangerous prospect that these drug-resistant genotypes may spread to Africa, where most of the
world’s malaria cases occur.
In this proposal, we will introduce and evaluate a number of drug-resistance management strategies that are
intended to prevent, delay, and slow down the spread of drug-resistant genotypes of P. falciparum. First, we will
make a number of technical advances in our existing individual-based (agent-based) simulation that we already
use to model the evolution and epidemiology of P. falciparum in human populations. We will add explicit grid-
based spatial structure to make the model more realistic. Additionally, we will add a genotype-phenotype map
and clinically-parameterized pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic sub-models to make the model’s drug-
resistance component as realistic as current data allow. Second, we will evaluate strategies for how best to
manage the population-level introduction of novel antimalarial therapies that will become available in the 2020s.
The strategies will be aimed at minimizing the long-term risk of drug resistance to both the novel therapies and
to currently used ACTs, in order to minimize the number of treatment failures in the long run. Finally, we will
parameterize country scenarios for Cambodia, Zambia, and Burkina Faso to provide specific country-level advice
in low, medium, and high transmission malaria settings on how best to preëmpt drug resistance or minimize its
current spread. As Cambodia is the epicenter of the current wave of artemisinin resistance, the Cambodia-
specific model will be used to provide advice on how to contain and eliminate currently circulating artemisinin-
resistant genotypes of P. falciparum."
10886528,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Dietary changes in metal nutrients, including zinc and iron, influence the composition of the microbiota
and correlate with increased infection susceptibility and gastrointestinal diseases, but the molecular mechanisms
underlying these effects remain largely unknown. This lack of knowledge severely limits our ability to predict how
diet or host metal status will impact treatment of gastrointestinal diseases or infection. Our long-term goal is to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing how essential metals affect the human gut microbiota. The
overall objective of the proposed work is to determine how essential metals affect growth and communication
within probiotic bacterial communities of Lactobacillus species. Our research strategy is 1) to develop and apply
protein-based fluorescent sensors that do not rely on oxygen and 2) to uncover molecular mechanisms through
which metal ions affect gut microbiota homeostasis. Oxygen-insensitive protein-based fluorescent sensors will
be used in live anaerobic cultures containing Lactobacillus to study metal uptake and how metal ion levels vary
over time. Pure, multispecies, and in vitro gut model cultures will be used to evaluate how metal ion homeostasis
varies with additional bacterial species and increasing complexity. Beyond direct detection and tracking of
essential metals in culture with fluorescent sensors, we are carrying out systematic studies to measure how
changes in essential metals affect Lactobacillus physiology and cell-cell communication (quorum sensing). Here,
we are investigating the capacity of Lactobacillus species to store excess metal ions and aiming to identify the
genes affected by varied metal levels in growth cultures. We are also measuring how varied metal levels affect
the abundance of Lactobacillus quorum sensing signaling molecules. This research program is enhanced by
collaborations with experts in microbiology, microbiome, and advanced fluorescence microscopy. The research
is significant because it will provide mechanistic insight to how dietary metals affect gut microbiota composition
and function. This insight is important because it will be useful for predicting the effects of metal-based dietary
interventions and could potentially identify new targets to mitigate these effects. Furthermore, it will provide a
knowledge basis for probiotic dietary interventions to combat gastrointestinal diseases and potentially identify
new drug targets. The research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from current work
by shifting focus to uncover molecular-level mechanisms and roles for metal ions in gut bacteria that affect
microbiota composition and function. By studying the Lactobacillus genus, we take advantage of well-established
genetic approaches while focusing on an abundant organism in the small intestine, where most metal nutrient
uptake occurs. Furthermore, Lactobacillus are well accepted as probiotics, but much remains to be learned about
their beneficial mechanisms of action. Developing new protein-based metal sensors to overcome the oxygen-
dependency of current protein-based sensors will allow detection of bacterial metal uptake and exposure in
culture and in in vitro gut models under physiological (anaerobic) conditions."

The majority of the human transcriptome consists of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate the
expression and function of protein-coding genes, immune cell development, differentiation, and response to
pathogens. Infections induce global changes in lncRNA expression. The expression of lncRNAs in HIV-infected
cells and how host lncRNAs impact the replication and persistence of HIV infection are unknown. A spontaneous
functional cure of HIV-1 occurs in 0.3-0.5% of all HIV patients. These patients, termed elite controllers (EC),
maintain undetectable levels of HIV in the absence of treatment, maintain stable CD4+ T cell counts, and are
less likely to transmit HIV. The ECs exemplify spontaneous control of HIV, and identifying defense mechanisms
in these patients holds promise for finding a functional cure for HIV infection. Previous studies focused on protein-
coding genes. However, effective HIV control is likely to involve complex gene networks, including lncRNAs. We
found several lncRNAs significantly suppressed in EC vs. HAART-treated chronic HIV-patients and healthy
uninfected controls. The functional impact of lncRNAs suppressed in EC (SIEC) on HIV outcomes is unknown.
We have observed significant global changes in cellular lncRNA expression in HIV-infected CD4+T cells
compared to uninfected cells in our preliminary studies. Cellular functions of most of the HIV deregulated (HIDE)
lncRNAs are yet to be determined. We employed a CRISPR/RfxCas13d (CasRx)-silencing screen to determine
the functional impact of SIEC and HIDE lncRNAs on HIV replication. Our preliminary data showed that silencing
of several SIEC and HIDE lncRNAs significantly regulated HIV replication. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that host lncRNA expression in HIV-infected cells orchestrates natural resistance and disease
outcome in HIV infection. We will determine how the suppression of specific lncRNAs in ECs is protective and
elucidate molecular mechanisms of their function (Aim 1). We will also identify HIV deregulated (HIDE) lncRNAs
modulating viral replication and investigate the mechanism(s) underlying lncRNA-mediated regulation (Aim 2).
We will pursue these aims using innovative combinations of molecular and biochemical techniques, such as
CRISPR/CasRx-silencing, transcriptomics, RNA antisense purification, and Mass-Spectrometry in cell line
models as well as primary CD4+ T cells. The proposed research is significant because it will identify cellular
lncRNAs that influence spontaneous control of HIV and disease outcomes, deliver unprecedented insight into
lncRNA-mediated regulation of HIV replication, lay the groundwork for the development of new approaches to
intervention."

Among people living with HIV (PLWH), positive affect is uniquely associated with lower levels of depression,
slower disease progression, better adherence to medication, and higher likelihood of achieving suppressed viral
load, independent of negative affect. In two randomized controlled trials with PLWH (R01 MH084723; R01
DA033854), we have shown significant beneficial effects of an intervention that aims to increase positive affect
on viral suppression and psychological well being. We also have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and
early efficacy of a self-guided, online-delivered, positive affect skills intervention for PLWH (R34 MH101265).
Now, in collaboration with the AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC), we propose to conduct a Hybrid Type II
effectiveness-implementations study of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) of mental health
screening and referral to ORCHID (Optimizing Resilience and Coping with HIV through Internet Delivery). The
proposed study was initiated by AFC, which developed the mental health screening and selected the SW-CRT
design as an ethical way to study implementation while ensuring that all clients with elevated depression receive
the intervention. Mental health screening + ORCHID will be implemented through all medical case managers
(MCMs) at 17 Ryan White-funded clinics in Chicago. We will use the RE-AIM framework to structure the
effectiveness and implementation outcomes and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) to understand the implementation outcomes at the patient and clinic levels. The specific aims are to: (1)
Operationalize an implementation facilitation strategy to link mental health screening with referral to ORCHID
through MCMs at Ryan White-funded clinics in Chicago; (2) Determine the effectiveness of screening + ORCHID
for improving depression, retention in care, and viral suppression, among 300 PLWH receiving care at 17 Ryan
White clinical sites, using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design. Depression is the primary outcome and
retention in care and viral suppression at both the individual and clinic level are the secondary outcomes; and
(3) Evaluate the implementation of screening + ORCHID and iteratively refine the strategy for subsequent steps.
The proposed research holds significant promise for advancing current knowledge on how best to integrate and
respond to mental health screening in Ryan White clinics. Data from the hybrid trial will result in a sustainable,
scalable program that can be disseminated in Ryan White clinics nationwide, thus holding significant promise for
advancing Chicago toward goals in the National Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan."

Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile causes nearly 500,000 infections a year in the United States, leading to nearly
30,000 deaths. The CDC has declared C. difficile an “urgent” threat to public health, the highest threat category.
New treatments are sorely needed. Many of our most useful antibiotics target the cell envelope. However, little
is known about cell envelope biogenesis or cell envelope stress response in C. difficile. These cell envelope
stress response systems may play an important role in antibiotic resistance. By understanding how C. difficile
responds to cell envelope stress we may uncover better treatment options for C. difficile infections. Surotomycin,
a daptomycin derivative, which targets peptidoglycan synthesis showed promise as a potential treatment for C.
difficile. However, conflicting phase 3 clinical trials have halted development of surotomycin as a treatment for
C. difficile infections. We used multiple genetic approaches to identify key factors involved in daptomycin
resistance. By isolating spontaneous daptomycin resistant mutants and performing Tn-seq we identified two
different two component regulatory systems, DraRS and DapRS, that are involved in daptomycin resistance. We
will pursue three specific aims to dissect the role of these regulators in controlling daptomycin resistance and
cell envelope stress response. In Aim 1 we will define how the DraRS regulatory system contributes to antibiotic
resistance. We will test both gain-of-function and loss-of-function draRS mutants for their effect on resistance to
a number of cell envelope stresses and on cell envelope biogenesis. We will also define the DraR regulon and
determine the contribution of individual genes to antibiotic resistance and cell envelope biogenesis and stress
response. In Aim 2 we will dissect how activity of DraR is controlled in response to cell envelope stress. Our
preliminary data suggest DraRS is activated by antibiotics disrupt the lipid-II cycle. We will use CRISPRi to test
this model by genetically recapitulating the effects of antibiotics and determining the effect on DraR activation.
We will also isolate mutants of DraS that are unable to respond to cell envelope stress. In Aim 3 we will define
the role of DapRS and the DapRS-regulated genes hexSDF in cell envelope biogenesis. Our data suggest they
are required for production of a unique glycolipid which makes up 16% of the polar lipids in the C. difficile
membrane. We will define the DapR regulon and how individual regulon members contribute to daptomycin
resistance, cell charge, and lipid content and cell envelope stress response.
Together these aims will advance our understanding of C. difficile by defining how it resists cell-wall acting
antibiotics like daptomycin and vancomycin."

The Biostatistics Shared Resource (B-SR) personnel collaborate with SCI members in all seven programs and
support all phases of research, from population and basic sciences through translational studies to clinical trials
and effectiveness research. Capabilities are matched to the needs of SCI members, providing a full range of
biostatistics and study design expertise, from standard techniques to innovative methods developed specifically
to enhance the basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences research efforts. Since the last review and
based on SCI member feedback, the former Biostatistics and Informatics Shared Resource was divided into two
separate resources in 2017 (with EAB and NCI approval): (1) the B-SR and (2) the Biomedical Informatics Shared
Resource (BI-SR). While the two resources continue to have synergy, the change has allowed for a deeper focus
on each SR’s individual missions. The new BI-SR focuses on data organization, curation, management, and
mining that supports the studies. The B-SR strengths are study design and results analysis, with emphasis on
statistically sound methodology. The B-SR also plays a key role in the Protocol Review and Monitoring
Committee and the Clinical Trials Scientific Review Committee. Members of all programs regularly use the B-
SR, with the heaviest use coming from the Population Sciences and Cancer Therapeutics programs. The B-SR
participated in 82 cancer-focused publications in the current funding period, 16 of them in high-impact

10887927,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common congenital infection in the US, affecting one
in every 200 infants each year. Approximately 10% of newborns impacted by cCMV have symptoms at birth,
such as small size for gestational age, jaundice, petechiae/purpira, and hepatosplenomegaly. Symptomatic
cCMV is associated with a higher risk of long-term sequelae and mortality. Despite its significant clinical
consequences, cCMV remains one of the least recognized and understood viruses that can spread from
pregnant patients to their unborn children.
There is an urgent need for high-quality evidence on the risks of long-term neurologic and non-neurologic
sequelae and on the benefits of available treatments for these outcomes among cCMV infected infants. While
neurologic sequelae are commonly reported in cCMV infected infants, the available evidence has significant
limitations (e.g., limited follow-up and sample sizes) preventing accurate quantification of the risks of long-term
neurologic sequelae attributable to cCMV infection. While several studies have reported cases of non-
neurological adverse outcomes among infants and children with cCMV, including hepatitis, pneumonitis, and
myocarditis, it is currently unknown whether cCMV infection leads to long-term non-neurologic sequelae.
Whereas randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of ganciclovir and valganciclovir in
preventing hearing deterioration, improving hearing and early neurodevelopmental milestones in symptomatic
infants before the age of 2, it remains unclear whether antivirals also reduce the risks of late-onset hearing loss
and long-term neurologic and non-neurologic sequelae.
Using nationwide cohorts of publicly (Medicaid, 2000-2020) and privately (MarketScan, 2003-2021) insured
neonates (≈ 29 million, both cohorts to be updated as new data become available during the course of the
study), which provide a unique, highly representative sample of the overall US neonatal and pediatric
population, as well as sophisticated epidemiologic design and analytic approaches and novel tree-based
scanning signal detection methods, we will address the following specific aims: (i) to quantify the risks of
neurologic long-term sequelae among infants with clinically recognized cCMV; (ii) to conduct a systematic
surveillance of newborns with clinically recognized cCMV to detect signals of adverse long-term non-neurologic
health consequences. For both aims, the effect of antiviral treatment on the risk of these neurologic and non-
neurologic outcomes will be evaluated.
By harnessing the power of existing real-world data, the proposed studies will have an immediate and
important public health impact by informing the value of universal screening, early antiviral treatments and

The specific objective of this proposal is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a novel screening approach for
cervical cancer (CC) using a topically applied, disease-specific plasmid containing a secreted reporter. CC is the
fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. Despite the availability of clinical screening methods and
effective treatments for early stages of CC in the U.S., disproportionately high incidence and mortality due to CC
is prevalent in rural Black communities. This disparity is due partly to poor follow-up resulting from socioeconomic
barriers and poor access to clinical care in these communities. The long-term goal of this project is to mitigate
these barriers by developing a sensitive, home-based screening approach for CC by means of a diagnostic
plasmid. As a first step in achieving the long-term goal, this proposal will test the hypothesis that a topically
applied, disease-specific plasmid, containing a secreted reporter protein driven by the Inhibition of Differentiation
1 (Id1) promotor, can be used to detect CC. Id1 has minimal expression in normal adult tissues but is
overexpressed in CC, where expression correlates with the stage of disease. Topical application of the plasmid
to the cervix would promote transfection via nonspecific endocytosis. Following transfection, CC cells that have
upregulation of Id1, but not normal cervical cells, will secrete the reporter protein into the cervical cavity for non-
invasive collection. The experimental approach will use CC cells, CC tissues freshly resected from human
patients, and animal models to establish feasibility and specificity for CC screening with a plasmid containing the
Id1 promotor and secreted reporter. Aim 1 will determine correlations between Id1 expression and reporter
production in CC cell lines with varying degrees of Id1 expression and in fresh human CC tissues following
transfection in vitro. Specificity of reporter production as a function of Id1 and due to the presence of CC relative
to healthy cervical tissue will be evaluated. Aim 2 will establish feasibility for topical application of the plasmid in
vivo using mice bearing human CC tumor xenografts. Plasmid-induced reporter production will be measured as
a function of time and as a function of the number of transfected cells following topical transfection. The minimum
tumor burden required for reporter-based detection in cervical fluids will be determined. Successful completion
of the aims will demonstrate feasibility and specificity of the diagnostic plasmid approach in CC models. Long-
term impact: This work will establish the foundation for advancing the plasmid-based approach into future stages
of development using translationally relevant vectors and cervical applicator materials for plasmid delivery and
reporter protein collection. Ultimately, we envision a diagnostic approach that in the long-term will enable highly
specific, cost-effective, self-applied CC screening to facilitate targeted clinical follow up and treatment for
individuals in high-risk settings associated with reduced access to routine gynecological care."

Serological Biomarkers for Monitoring Human-Vector Contact
 by Invasive Anopheles stephensi in Africa
Anopheles stephensi was historically considered a major malaria vector in urban environments in
Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. Since its first detection in Djibouti in
2012, the distribution of this vector species has expanded to Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia in the
Horn of Africa, and Nigeria in west Africa. Establishment and spread of An. stephensi in Africa
pose major challenges for malaria control and elimination in fast-growing urban Africa because
An. stephensi is a confirmed vector for local African Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax strains
and is resistant to multiple classes of synthetic insecticides. Accordingly, the World Health
Organization recently established an initiative to take concerted actions to stop the spread of An.
stephensi by improving surveillance and control of this species in Africa. However, the commonly-
used mosquito surveillance methods such as CDC light traps, human landing catches and larval
dipping methods lack the necessary sensitivity in urban settings due to environmental light
pollution and low vector abundance. However, sensitive surveillance of An. stephensi is critical to
its early detection and control. Recently, serological methods for monitoring human-vector contact
by measuring antibody response to mosquito salivary proteins have been developed. However,
the available serological method is based on well-conserved proteins and cannot be used to
differentiate An. stephensi exposure from those of native Anopheles species. The objective of this
R21 application is to develop serological biomarkers that can distinguish exposure to invasive An.
stephensi from the native African malaria vector species using novel peptide microarray
technology. Two aims are proposed: 1) identify salivary peptides that distinguish the exposure of
invasive An. stephensi from the native African malaria vector species, An. arabiensis, using novel
peptide microarray technology; and 2) evaluate candidate salivary peptides using human plasma
from field sites with contrasting An. stephensi distribution in Ethiopia. The new tool from this
project can be used to measure human-vector contact with the invasive An. stephensi, and thus
help assess the role of An. stephensi in malaria transmission. Serological biomarkers have the
potential to be utilized in domesticated animals, the main blood source for An. stephensi
mosquitoes. This could enhance the detection sensitivity of invasive An. stephensi mosquitoes,
thereby facilitating the surveillance and control of An. stephensi populations in Africa."
10889851,"Summary
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a prominent healthcare threat with an estimated 4.95 million cases associated
with bacterial AMR in 2019, and poses a particularly difficult challenge with regard to intracellular pathogens that
have evolved to hijack host defenses for their own benefit. A deep view of host-pathogen interactions including
a greater understanding of how pathogens adapt and change in response to host cues is critical to gain insights
into the factors responsible for AMR. While the response of hosts to bacterial infection has been extensively
studied, the converse i.e. how pathogen gene expression and in turn pathogen physiology is modulated in
response to host cues has gathered little attention. Lack of robust technologies to sequence minute amounts of
bacterial RNA from infected cells has been one of the limiting factors. Using a recently developed technology -
Path-Seq, we reliably sequenced macrophage-resident Salmonella to discover a role for host Caspase-1 in
dampening AMR of intracellular Salmonella. This was mediated through inhibition of the bacterial two-component
signal transduction system – PhoPQ, a major contributor responsible for Salmonella's ability to resist host
cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and the drug Polymyxin B, which is a last resort antibiotic against Gram-
negative pathogens. Interestingly, Caspase-1 which is conventionally recognized as a protease important for
inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, dampens CAMP resistance of Salmonella in a manner independent of
its catalytic/protease activity. In this proposal we will thoroughly investigate the mechanism by which host
Caspase-1 inhibits PhoPQ activation and CAMP resistance of intracellular Salmonella independent of its activity.
In Aim 1 we will conduct a molecular dissection of the bacterial pathway and the pathogen effectors downstream
of PhoPQ activation that are targeted by Caspase-1. In Aim 2 we will investigate how host Caspase-1 inhibits
CAMP resistance of intracellular Salmonella, either by directly acting on the bacterium or indirectly by regulating
host processes that in turn control PhoPQ activation and CAMP resistance. Targeting this non-canonical,
pyroptosis independent arm of Caspase-1 may be particularly useful in curbing AMR of pathogens such as
Salmonella that evade inflammasome activation and replicate intracellularly. Our findings will reveal a novel
activity-independent role for Caspase-1 in controlling bacterial signaling and AMR, and because PhoPQ
activation dictates multiple aspects of pathogen physiology such as intracellular replication and virulence, will
also form a framework for exploring the impact of host Caspase-1 on processes beyond AMR in intracellular
Gram-negative pathogens."

This study explores the potential of harnessing the natural tropism of Zika virus (ZIKV) to target glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and reprogram the typically immune suppressive GBM tumor environment to an inflammatory, antigen-presenting environment that induces GBM-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The first goal of this proposal is to identify the cellular mechanisms that drive anti-tumor T cell responses following ZIKV treatment. Our research will examine the functional roles of two distinct myeloid cell subsets induced following ZIKV treatment - CCR2+ monocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and dendritic cell subset-2 (DC-2s) in draining lymph nodes (dLN) - in driving anti-tumor T cell responses against GBM. Additionally, our study will examine the synergistic therapeutic potential of a highly novel Flt3 ligand therapy and ZIKV combination therapy as a strategy to activate both dendritic cell subset-1 (DC-1s) and DC-2, to maximize anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses and subsequent GBM rejection. This research is significant because 1) it addresses the potential of ZIKV as an effective oncolytic virus for GBM treatment, 2) identifies key cellular mechanisms that contribute to its anti-tumor effects and 3) addresses the current failure of immunotherapy and maps a therapeutic path forward."

Anti-dsDNA antibodies are serological hallmarks of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and key markers for
diagnosis and disease activity. The close association of anti-dsDNA antibodies with SLE has suggested that
understanding the origin of these antibodies would reveal key mechanisms in SLE pathogenesis. Nonetheless,
while anti-dsDNA antibodies are likely the best-characterized autoantibodies at the genetic and molecular level,
their antigenic origin and mechanisms of pathogenicity remain unclear. To date, the conclusion from previous
studies is that anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE originate from non-reactive precursors, which undergone affinity
maturation against dsDNA as the primary antigen. Different to this paradigm, our preliminary studies suggest an
alternative hypothesis in which anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross-reactive antibodies that originate from germline
precursors targeting a protein self-antigen, and that cross-reactivity to dsDNA results from somatic
hypermutation. Because gaining reactivity to dsDNA has little or no effect on reactivity to the original protein
antigen, this process creates cross-reactive autoantibodies with the functional capacity to target the protein and
bind dsDNA with high affinity. As a model, this new paradigm offers a rational explanation for the high
heterogeneity of anti-dsDNA antibodies in terms of origin, physicochemical and pathogenic properties. To
address this novel hypothesis, we will define the extended antigen specificity of a large set of mutated and
germline reverted SLE-derived monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies using a human proteome microarray platform.
The goal is to uncover both the primary specificities that preceded the origin of anti-dsDNA antibodies, and the
protein targets that may determine their pathogenic effect in SLE. The final goal of this work is to gain new
insights into disease mechanisms, thus laying the foundation to explore novel therapies."
10889791,"Rhythm and timing are critical to successful social interactions as rhythm sensitivity enables us to form
predictions and adapt and coordinate our behavior with each other. This is particularly evident during spoken
communication such as through the occurrence of conversational entrainment (or convergence), in which
interlocutors temporally adapt their speech patterns to those of their partner. We recently demonstrated links
between rhythm and speech entrainment by adapting a novel and automated beat-tracking algorithm, originally
designed for use with musical rhythms, to speech in order to reveal the underlying metrical timing of spoken
utterances. We observed that typically developing adults converge their speech rhythms during spontaneous
conversation, suggesting an underlying rhythm mechanism that is present in spoken communication. This
conversational entrainment process occurs automatically but is also moderated by social factors: Greater
conversational entrainment occurs between dyads with higher versus lower social agreement throughout the
interaction. These results, which suggest that both underlying rhythm processing and situational social factors
contribute to interpersonal communication, inform mechanisms of social communication in typical development,
as well as disruptions in social communication in autism (ASD). A common and lifelong disorder, individuals on
the autism spectrum exhibit challenges in rhythm and timing of social communication and interaction including
reduced interpersonal coordination. Individuals on the autism spectrum also exhibit impairments in non-social
rhythm skills, with particular difficulties perceiving and synchronizing motor movements to a regular auditory
beat. Building on our prior work, the current project proposes that impairments in flexibly tracking and updating
rhythmic behavior underlies challenges across sensorimotor and social communication domains in autism. This
R21 study investigates underlying processes and outcomes of conversational entrainment in adults with and
without autism including the relationship between sensorimotor synchronization and conversational entrainment
(Aim 1), adaptation to dynamic social factors as a moderator of conversational entrainment (Aim 2), and
conversational entrainment as a predictor of social affiliation (Aim 3). In accordance with PA-21-200, this project
advances research into the role of sensory, motor, and social factors in social interactions and communication
in autism. Results will inform theories of communication impairment focused on specific rhythmic processes as
an underlying mechanism disrupted in autism and demonstrate how individual and dyadic attributes contribute
to social communication success."

10892091,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The central hypothesis for the Center for Adolescent Rhythms, Reward, and Sleep (CARRS) is that adolescent
development acts on underlying sleep and circadian traits to modify homeostatic sleep drive, circadian phase,
and circadian alignment, which in turn impact cortico-limbic functions critical to substance use risk (e.g., reward
and cognitive control). We further hypothesize that specific manipulations of sleep and circadian rhythms during
adolescence will affect reward responsivity and cognitive control in either positive or negative directions. These
manipulations will provide experimental support our model, and proof of concept for novel clinical interventions
to reduce the risk of substance use and abuse. Core C: Data Management and Statistics will support the 5
projects in CARRS by managing data (e.g., developing protocols, forms, and databases and assuring data
quality and security) and performing statistical analyses (e.g., preliminary, primary, secondary, and exploratory
analyses). In this way, Core C will guarantee high-quality, transparent, and consistent standards for data
management and statistical analyses across projects and will maximize rigor and reproducibility within CARRS.
Core C will also develop and adapt analytic methods that take full advantage of the translational and high-
dimensional data captured across the 5 projects within CARRS. Areas of focus will include: use of supervised
learning (e.g., random forests) for prediction with high-dimensional data within humans and, separately, rodents;
methods for integrating findings across projects and species (based on data from Projects 1-5), and quantitative
“multi-omic” methods for integrating RNA-seq and mass spectrometry data. Finally, we will educate researchers
within CARRS and in the research community on existing and cutting-edge statistical methods relevant for our
research. Topics will include rigor and reproducibility, analysis of sleep and circadian data, analysis of RNA
sequencing and proteomic data, and the innovative statistical methods developed and applied within Core C."
10892093,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 1 (P1)
Substance use disorders (SUD) are widely prevalent and pose devastating health, financial, and societal costs.
The incidence of SU increases across adolescence, making this sensitive developmental period one of both
heightened risk and heightened opportunity for prevention and intervention. However, to develop effective
interventions, we need to identify novel and modifiable risk factors and mechanisms for SUD. Circadian rhythm
and sleep disturbances have strong ties to SU risk, and their effects on intermediary markers of SU risk in
adolescence—reward and inhibitory control systems—provides a plausible mechanistic substrate. The Center’s
conceptual model posits that adolescent development is associated with enhanced reward function relative to
cognitive control, phase delay in endogenous circadian rhythms, and lower homeostatic sleep drive.
Environmental and social factors interact with these developmental processes, often resulting in late sleep
timing, short sleep duration, and circadian misalignment—each of which is associated with increased substance
use in teens and young adults. P1 will utilize the constant routine paradigm to rigorously characterize circadian
rhythms and homeostatic sleep drive by controlling for masking influences of physical activity, posture, meals,
and light levels. We will examine their individual and combined effects on measures of reward and cognitive
control, and in combination with P2, on the development of substance use, to test the underlying mechanisms
involved in the CARRS conceptual model. P1 will enroll 96 adolescents ages 13–15 (50% female) stratified by
habitual sleep timing (early, intermediate, late, N=32 each). Participants will monitor sleep patterns at home with
actigraphy and sleep diary, then complete fMRI measures of reward and cognitive control and a 60-hour lab
session. The lab session includes two nights of polysomnographic (PSG) sleep studies, separated by 36 hours
of sleep deprivation. After the first PSG, participants will follow a constant routine for the next 24 hours with
wakeful bedrest; semi-recumbent posture; constant dim light; and hourly nutritional supplements. After 24 hours,
participants will remain awake, but not confined to bed. Physiological circadian measures include salivary
melatonin; core body temperature; and molecular rhythms from hair follicle cells (examined in P3). Physiological
sleep homeostatic measures include waking EEG theta power. and delta sleep EEG response following 36 hours
of wakefulness. Behavioral tests indexing cognitive control performance with and without reward modulation
along with self-reports of mood and sleepiness will be collected every 2 hours. Finally, online surveys will index
substance use every 6 months through study conclusion. P1 will draw directly on resources provided by the
Center Cores. CARRS and P1 will innovatively advance understanding of distinct circadian and sleep
homeostatic effects on reward-cognitive control function and the development of adolescent SU."
10892096,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance Use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUDs) are widely prevalent and pose devastating health,
financial and societal costs. The primary goal of the CARRS Center is to understand how sleep and circadian
rhythm traits and environmental disruptions during adolescence lead to increased vulnerability for substance
abuse. We further aim to test whether manipulation of sleep and circadian factors during adolescence will alter
factors associated with increased risk for SU. The incidence of SU and SUDs increases across adolescence,
making this sensitive developmental period one of both heightened risk—and heightened opportunity for
prevention and intervention. However, to develop effective interventions, we need to identify novel and modifiable
risk factors and mechanisms for SUD. Project 2 (P2) of CARRS will test the hypothesis that individual differences
in sleep and circadian characteristics during adolescence are associated with self-report, behavioral, and neural
indicators of reward function and cognitive control, which in turn are associated with increased risk for SU.
Further, P2 tests an experimental intervention that manipulates sleep and circadian rhythms to directly examine
its impact on reward function. P2 will study 150 adolescents (age 13–15) with early (n=50) and late (n=100)
sleep timing. All participants will complete 2 weeks of home sleep monitoring, followed by an overnight laboratory
visit to assess self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging (fMRI) tasks of cognitive control and reward function,
as well as circadian phase via salivary melatonin and molecular rhythms via hair follicles. The Late group will
continue to the experimental study, each participant randomized to 2-week manipulation or attentional control
conditions (n=50 each). Finally, we include repeated 6-month follow-up assessments of sleep and SU for all
participants in P1 and P2 to examine longitudinal associations. Aim 1 is to compare Early versus Late sleepers
on sleep/circadian factors and neurobehavioral markers. Dependent variables include circadian phase, sleep
duration, and circadian misalignment, as well as self-report, behavioral, and neural measures of cognitive control
and reward function. Aim 2 is to probe the acute effects of experimental sleep advance and extension on sleep
and circadian rhythms, as well as effects on neurobehavioral markers of SUD risk, in adolescents with late sleep
timing (n=100). Our Collaborative Aim (P1/P2) is to examine whether sleep/circadian factors, cognitive control,
and reward function predict subsequent SU across follow-up using self-report, behavioral, and neural measures,
as well multivariable machine learning approaches (Core C). P2 will draw directly on resources of Core A:
Administration, Core B: Phenotyping and Biobanking, and Core C: Data Management and Statistics. Findings
from P2 will complement findings on circadian rhythmicity and homeostatic sleep drive from P1 and will provide
definitive findings on how manipulation of sleep/circadian rhythms alters cognitive control, reward function, and
SU risk in humans, which may, in turn, inform novel sleep and circadian-based interventions to reduce this risk."
10892089,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Center for Adolescent Rhythms, Reward, and Sleep (CARRS) Phenotyping and Biobanking Core (Core
B) supports the research projects through the acquisition of research subjects with specific phenotypic
characteristics required by the human and animal projects. Our central hypothesis is that late sleep timing,
short sleep duration, and circadian misalignment adversely impact cortico-limbic function in adolescents,
further enhancing reward sensitivity, impairing cognitive control, and increasing substance use risk. The
coordinated and deliberate procedures for assuring analogous phenotypic characteristics in humans and
animals provide the foundation for this translational scientific program. For human studies (Projects 1 and 2),
Core B will conduct systematic recruitment and screening of adolescents ages 13 through 15 years old to
provide participants systematically varied in sleep timing. For rodent studies, Core B will establish a breeding
and phenotyping pipeline to provide the animals required for Projects 3, 4 and 5. Core B will also provide
biobanking services, including the collection, management, and banking of specimens from adolescent
humans and adolescent HS rats to measure molecular rhythm phenotypes and to provide a high-quality
repository for future mechanistic studies. Core B contributes to this innovative translational research program
by collaboratively developing and implementing plans for assuring analogous phenotypes for CARRS human
adolescent and adolescent rodent model studies."

 This revised R01 application aims to use natural medicinal compounds (NMCs) to enhance bioactivity
of synthetic bone grafts. The delivery of NMCs in synthetic bone grafts, such as calcium phosphate (CaP)
scaffolds, is critical to modulate bone cell-materials interactions to improve in vivo osteogenesis and
angiogenesis. Using NMCs, we propose to investigate osteoinductive, 3D-Printed (3DP) CaP bone grafts
without using any growth factors (GF) or proteins towards applications in orthopedics and dentistry. However,
there still exists a clinical need to innovate osteoinductive synthetic resorbable biomaterials that will promote
angiogenesis, exhibiting biological properties similar to autografts. We propose to use NMCs such as curcumin
from turmeric, acemannan from aloe vera, and essential nutrients such as Vitamin D3 to improve
osseointegration in CaPs instead of using GFs. In our preliminary studies, we have seen promising results
showing angiogenesis and enhanced osteogenesis due to the presence of NMCs. We have found that
curcumin can enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis of 3DP CaP scaffolds. From our previous work, we
have also established that addition of dopants such as Mg2+, Si4+, Zn2+ and Ag+ in CaP can improve
mechanical properties, enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis while improving antimicrobial response in
vivo. Combining our exciting preliminary results on NMCs and established data on dopant chemistry, we
propose to demonstrate next generation of synthetic bone grafts without any GF or proteins for applications in
dentistry and orthopedics, which is the premise of this application.
 The objective of this research is to test our central hypothesis that NMC-loaded doped CaP porous 3D
Printed (3DP) scaffolds will enhance osteogenic and angiogenic properties in vivo. The rationale is that once
we understand the required dose for different NMCs, their release kinetics, and the mechanism of bone cell-
materials interactions modulation, the key knowledge gaps, we can design GF free synthetic bone grafts
similar to autografts in clinical applications. Our long-range goal is to demonstrate clinically relevant patient
matched, osteogenic and angiogenic doped CaP or CaP– polymer scaffolds with NMCs that will substitute
autologous bone for repair, replacement, and augmentation in orthopedics and dentistry. To achieve our
research objectives, we propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is focused on understanding the influence of NMCs
on enhanced bioactivity of porous CaP ceramic, and ceramic-polymer composite scaffolds in vitro. Aim 2 is
focused on measuring osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo using NMC loaded porous CaP ceramic and
ceramic-polymer composite scaffolds. If successful, NMCs can also work with other materials for dental and
orthopedic applications."
10890404,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Myelin is the insulating sheath around neuronal axons (consisting of 25% proteins/75% lipids) that facilitates
fast and efficient signal transduction. In the recent years, its plasticity has been shown to be key for cognition,
memory formation and consolidation. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) debilitates cognition and memory, with amyloid
and tau being hallmarks of the disease, yet its onset and progression mechanisms remain unresolved. Recent
evidence from imaging, proteomics, and genomics support myelin’s involvement in AD, as well as interactions
with amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammation. Yet myelin’s role, pattern of degeneration, and interplay with AD pa-
thology remain unknown. A limiting factor has been the lack of myelin studies integrating different scales: a ma-
croscopic myelin imaging method with targeted molecular profiling and correlations with known AD pathologies.
 We aim to address this important knowledge gap by combining three innovative approaches. First, our
novel synchrotron X-ray imaging (SAXS-TT) that is specific to myelin due to photons diffracting off the periodic
myelin sheath and provides quantitative 3D maps of myelin levels and integrity. Second, our detailed 3D imag-
ing-histology registration pipeline, which enables precise registration of histology to 3D images. Third, the use
of lipidomics and proteomics to obtain molecular profiling of AD tissue as well as exosomes -nanosized vesi-
cles rich in cargo (lipids, proteins, RNA) that provide a snapshot of cell processes and cell communication.
 The project aims are: (1) To quantify AD-specific myelin degeneration in hippocampal subfields and tracts.
We will SAXS-TT-scan low AD, high AD, and normal aging hippocampal specimens, segment their subfields
and tracts in detail, and test if vulnerable tracts and associated subfields such as the perforant pathway, ento-
rhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3 have AD-specific myelination. (2) To determine the spatial relationship
between myelin degeneration and amyloid, tau, or inflammation. We will section Aim 1 specimens, stain for
amyloid, tau, and microglia and register histology with imaging using our serial blockface pipeline. This will al-
low correlating myelin with stains and provide evidence towards two literature-supported hypotheses: that mye-
lin degeneration overwhelms microglia inhibiting amyloid clearance, or that tau propagates via demyelinating
tracts. (3) To detect AD-specific molecular/exosomal markers linked to macroscopic myelin degeneration. Lipid
dysregulation is extensive in AD, but its origin is not known. We will test if it is driven by lipid-rich myelin, by
combining myelin levels with lipidomics/proteomics analysis to quantify myelin lipids and proteins in tissue and
exosomes, and test if specific lipids and proteins parallel macroscopic myelin loss. Introducing AD exosomes
to oligodendrocyte cultures and performing lipidomics/proteomics on the cells can show if in vivo myelin
changes are reflected in vitro, suggesting a potential disease propagation mechanism. This study will combine
macroscopic with molecular analyses to provide a multi-faceted view of myelin pathology in AD."

Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) has emerged as a dominant clinical problem as treatments for peripheral
disease improve and patients live longer. The blood brain barrier creates a unique challenge as it restricts access
of most standard drugs to brain lesions, so median survival rates have remained stagnant at <2 years. Although
the immune system is a critical controller of metastatic spread in the periphery and the basis for many effective
new therapeutics, little is known about the immune response to BCBM. We have utilized single-cell RNA-
sequencing to investigate the response of microglia, the predominant immune effector in the central nervous
system (CNS), to BCBM. We find that microglia display a dramatic pro-inflammatory response to BCBM,
characterized by increased expression of a diverse array of chemokines and machinery for antigen presentation
through MHCI and MHCII, and that pharmacological depletion of microglia increases metastatic progression. We
will test the hypothesis that microglia play critical roles in suppressing BCBM through 1) chemokine-mediated
peripheral immune recruitment to initiate an inflammatory cascade, and 2) local antigen presentation to sustain
T cell activation in the CNS. This work will establish the basic mechanisms by which microglia control metastatic
outgrowth, how CNS immunity to BCBM develops and ultimately fails, and provide new insights for how to
therapeutically exploit the immune system to control BCBM in patients."
10867331,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a syndrome of critical illness defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host
response to infection and is a leading cause of global mortality. In May of 2017, the World Health
Organization (WHO) made sepsis a global health priority. Yet, little is known about sepsis in the global
South and specifically sub-Saharan Africa where there are at least 1.2-2.2 million cases of sepsis and 6.5
million deaths due to infection annually. The majority of these patients are living with HIV. We have determined
the leading cause of sepsis in this region is tuberculosis (TB) which is responsible for 25-30% of bloodstream
infections in septic patients. TB sepsis is associated with 20-50% mortality rates with the majority of deaths
occurring within the first 4-5 days of admission. However, it is difficult to identify TB sepsis clinically or with
diagnostic tests which are often unavailable and have limited sensitivity. Therefore, TB can be missed and
patients with TB sepsis may not receive anti-TB therapy, or if they do, it may be delayed. However, we have
found that empiric treatment of TB in septic patients without a confirmed diagnosis of TB improves 28 day
survival. We have also studied anti-TB pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in septic patients and discovered
considerably low circulating drug concentrations that are suboptimal for microbial kill. Therefore, our
hypotheses are that immediate anti-TB therapy will improve 28 day survival compared to anti-TB therapy that
is administered only after a diagnosis is made, and that optimized sepsis-specific dosing will improve 28 day
mortality compared to conventional WHO recommended weight-based dosing regardless of the timing of
administration. We will test these hypotheses through a randomized 2x2 factorial clinical trial where
participants with HIV and sepsis will be randomized to 1) empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB therapy plus
standard care or diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy and standard care and 2) sepsis-specific dose anti-TB
therapy plus standard care or conventional WHO weight-based recommended dose anti-TB therapy and
standard care. This randomized 2x2 factorial clinical trial is strongly endorsed by Tanzanian and Ugandan
community advisory boards and will be the first to determine the optimal content, dosing, and timing of the
antimicrobial regimen for adult sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa."

There is an urgent need for agents that slow or arrest the progressive course of AD. BAN2401 and aducanumab,
antibodies partially targeting soluble Aβ oligomers, have shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, validating
amyloid targeting in AD. ALZ-801, an oral agent that selectively inhibits the formation of Aβ oligomers, is an
improved prodrug formulation of tramiprosate. ALZ-801 and its active agent, tramiprosate, showed favorable
preclinical and clinical safety that supports a regulatory submission. Alzheon is developing ALZ-801 as a
disease-modifying treatment for AD patients who are homozygous for the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E
gene (APOE4).
Tramiprosate was evaluated in two placebo-controlled 78-week Phase 3 trials, which enrolled 2025 patients with
Mild to Moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE, scores of 16-26). Co-primary efficacy outcomes
in both trials were: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) and Clinical
Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). In the completed Phase 3 trial, efficacy outcomes did not achieve
significance in the overall study population of 1052 subjects. In a protocol-specified analysis, there was clinically
meaningful efficacy in APOE4 carriers (approximately 60% of all subjects). Additional analyses revealed a gene
dose effect, with APOE4/4 homozygotes showing most benefit versus placebo (ADAS-cog ~3.0 points, nominal
p<0.05) on top of symptomatic therapy. This benefit was greater in the Mild APOE4/4 patients (MMSE 22-26)
who showed dose dependent efficacy, with the high dose group showing 5.5 points improvement on ADAS-cog,
nominal p = 0.0003. The strong efficacy of tramiprosate/ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 patients can be explained by their
high rate of amyloid positivity (98%) on amyloid PET imaging versus 60% in noncarriers. APOE4/4 AD patients
have also been shown to have a higher burden of Aβ oligomers than noncarriers. APOE4/4 patients therefore
represent an AD phenotype that is enriched with Aβ oligomers and most likely to benefit from the anti-oligomer
effect of ALZ-801.
Tramiprosate showed favorable long-term safety in ~1600 AD patients; the most common adverse events were
mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. In healthy elderly and AD subjects, ALZ-801 showed improved
gastrointestinal tolerability and improved pharmacokinetics compared to tramiprosate. We plan to conduct a
Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 patients with Early AD (MMSE 22-30) using
ADAS-cog as the primary clinical outcome. We will also evaluate the effects on an MRI imaging biomarker
(hippocampal volume), on plasma and CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and the correlations of biomarkers
with clinical outcomes. These results can confirm the efficacy of ALZ-801 as a disease-modifying drug by
stabilizing cognition, and potentially decreasing brain atrophy in this population. ALZ-801 has received FDA Fast
Track status, and positive data can support submission for regulatory approval and inform future AD trial designs."

There is little doubt that we are in the midst of a worldwide epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Recent data
suggest an inflammatory link between obesity and insulin resistance. This proposal will focus on adaptive
changes in energy expenditure during caloric overload and restriction, and explore a novel hypothesis that may
directly lead to new therapeutic approaches. We hypothesize that that activation and induction of the protein
kinase TBK1 in obesity and fasting reprograms metabolism to promote anabolic and repress catabolic
pathways, tipping the scales towards energy storage and away from expenditure. These conclusions are derived
from changes observed in mouse knockout mice, and in patients treated with the TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox.
Specifically, activation or induction of TBK1 represses AMPK activity, inhibiting lipid oxidation and
mitochondrial biogenesis while increasing lipogenesis. We will explore this hypothesis with three aims: 1) We
will evaluate the temporal and spatial aspects of TBK1 activation and induction during obesity, and
characterize the underlying mechanism; 2) We will explore the activation and induction of TBK1 during fasting,
and elucidate the molecular mechanisms; 3) We will assess the role of the TBK1/AMPK axis in controlling
metabolism during obesity and fasting via development of compound knockout mouse models, and evaluate
the temporal and spatial aspects of this regulation. These findings may reveal how energy expenditure is
repressed during caloric excess and restriction, and provide new therapeutic approaches to these devastating
diseases."
10867378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation is essential to maintaining cell identity, responding to
intra- and extra-cellular signals, and coordinating gene activities, whereas its dysregulation can
cause a broad range of disorders. Previous methods mainly used averaged genomic signals from
thousands of cells to investigate gene regulation, failing to reveal the regulatory heterogeneity
across diverse cell states. Recent advances in multimodal single-cell technologies provide new
opportunities to decipher the cell-type-specific regulation code at the finest resolution possible.
However, its computational modeling is still in its infancy due to the high dimensionality,
missingness, vulnerabilities to confounding factors, and complex feature interactions. In this
project, we aim to develop a suite of computational models to construct gene-centric, personal
regulome via single-cell multiome integration and link multi-scale dysregulations to disease.
 Distinct from previous efforts reporting a set of one-dimensional (1D) functional cis-regulatory
elements (CREs) from only one genome and applying it to all samples, we aim to construct
personal, compact, gene-centric, and cell-type-specific transcriptional regulome from sc-
multiome data. Specifically, we will first propose a scalable multimodal deep generative model to
integrate single-cell data with single-, multi-, and hybrid modalities. Distinct to existing methods,
we will include an invariant representation learning scheme to derive latent cell representations
uncorrelated with confounding factors (e.g., age, gender, read depth, and batch effects) for bias-
free transcriptome and epigenome reconstruction (Aim 1). Then, we will go beyond the 1D
genome annotation by deciphering multi-scale gene regulation code (Aim 2), including i)
functional CREs at a base-pair resolution; ii) CRE target genes for functional interpretation; iii)
transcription factor regulatory networks. Lastly, we will develop interpretable deep learning
models to link multi-scale dysregulations to disease with mechanistic explanation (Aim 3).
 This proposal is built on a close and long-term collaboration between Dr. Jing Zhang, an
expert in computational biology and machine learning at the University of California, Irvine, with
Dr. Feng Yue, an expert in regulatory genomics and 3D genome organization at the Northwestern
University. Upon completion, our proposed methods will substantially deepen our understanding
of transcriptional regulation to a single-cell level resolution and quantitatively relate multi-scale
risk factors to genetic disorders. In addition, our aims will yield open-source software for the
scientific community as essential tools for single-cell multi-omics data processing and integration."

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a major experimental technology to determine protein
structures as it reached atomic resolution (1.2-4Å) in recent years. Compared to traditional techniques (i.e., X-
ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance), cryo-EM has the unique capability of determining the
quaternary structures of large protein complexes and assemblies difficult or impossible for them to handle. The
advance of cryo-EM technology has stimulated a revolution in structural biology of studying large protein
complexes and assemblies that cannot be well studied before. However, the computational reconstruction of
protein structures from cryo-EM image data is still a time-consuming, labor-intensive, error-prone, and often
inaccurate process, due to the bottleneck in picking protein particles in cryo-EM images, substantial noise in 3D
cryo-EM density maps generated from particle images, and lack of automated and accurate methods to build
protein structures from density maps. We plan to develop advanced deep learning methods to reconstruct protein
structures automatically and accurately from cryo-EM images data, leveraging the large amount of high-
resolution cryo-EM data accumulated in the field and the latest advances in the deep learning technology.
 We will develop 2D transformer networks built on top of the attention mechanism that perform better than
traditional convolutional and recurrent neural networks in image processing to pick single protein particles
accurately and automatically in cryo-EM image data via a novel combination of unsupervised and supervised
learning. Moreover, we formulate the problem of denoising 3D cryo-EM density maps generated from 2D particle
images as a novel machine learning problem and will develop both 3D deep autoencoders and rotation-
/translation-equivariant transformer networks to remove noise in cryo-EM density maps. Furthermore, we will
develop end-to-end 3D rotation-/translation-equivariant networks to directly identify the backbone atoms of
proteins from 3D density maps without using any known structure as template, which will be used by a novel
hidden Markov model to build the high-resolution full-atom structures of any protein. The methods will be
rigorously evaluated on the large amount of cryo-EM data and compared with existing methods. All these
methods will be integrated together to create a fully automated machine learning pipeline, the first of its kind in
the field, to reconstruct protein structures more accurately from cryo-EM images than existing methods. We will
implement the individual deep learning methods as well as the entire pipeline as open-source packages released
at GitHub for the community to use. We will further validate the tools and pipeline by applying them to the new
cryo-EM data of a group of important membrane protein complexes (i.e., ion channels) to be generated at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory."
10867387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Endothelial mechano-transduction mechanisms are instrumental to vascular health and disease but
targeting disease-causing mechano-sensing pathways remains extremely challenging. For instance,
atherosclerosis preferentially develops at arterial curvatures and bifurcations where disturbed blood flow
activates endothelium; however, current atherosclerosis therapies mainly target systematic risk factors but not
the vasculature per se. This underscores the significance and unique opportunity to identify and target novel
mechanosensitive mechanisms in activated endothelium subjected to disturbed flow. This proposal aims to first
delineate novel endothelial mechano-sensing mechanisms and moreover, devise innovative precision
nanomedicine approaches targeting these disease-causing mechano-sensitive pathways.
 This R35 mechanism will provide us a unique opportunity to synergistically combine our efforts in
endothelial biology (R01 HL136765) and vascular nanomedicine (R01 HL138223), testing paradigm shift
hypotheses related to endothelial mechanotransduction and addressing an unmet medical need in vascular
therapies. Specifically, seminal work from us and colleagues along with our unpublished data identified three
new layers of molecular controls of endothelial mechano-transduction: epi-genome (DNA chemical
modification), epi-transcriptome (mRNA chemical modifications) and metabolism (glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation). The overall goals of this project are to 1) identify novel regulators governing the endothelial
epi-genomic, epi-transcriptomic, and metabolic responses to blood flow and 2) engineer innovative
nanoparticles which target each of these pathways treating vascular complications in vivo. The scientific
premise is that innovative nanoparticles can effectively deliver therapeutic nucleotides targeting these
mechano-sensitive pathways in activated endothelium.
 This proposal addresses a significant knowledge gap in endothelial biology and an uncharted territory
in vascular medicine, research directions being pursued by only a small number of laboratories world-wide.
Our team has laid much the groundwork in developing multidisciplinary knowledge, technologies, and animal
models necessary to investigate new endothelial mechanotransduction paradigms and moreover, devise
precision nanomedicine strategies for future tailor-made vascular therapies. Successful completion of the
proposal will establish a proof of concept of targeted nanomedicine in vascular wall-based therapies. The
proposed studies should further preclinical development and eventual clinical testing of new therapeutic
strategies to treat vascular diseases."
10867397,"Our sense of hearing is critically dependent on the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which connect the sound
receptors in the organ of Corti (OC) to the cochlear nuclei of the hindbrain. During development, SGNs establish
stereotyped innervation patterns with specific hair cell targets in the OC. Type I SGNs innervate inner hair cells
(IHCs) to transmit sound signals, while type II SGNs (SGNIIs) innervate outer hair cells (OHCs) to detect acoustic
trauma. Despite their essential functions in hearing, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
mediate wiring of the auditory periphery is still fragmentary.
 It has been shown recently that guidance of SGNII peripheral projections is regulated by the Planar Cell
Polarity (PCP) pathway. Intercellular PCP signaling mediates polarized cell behaviors within the plane of a tissue
in a plethora of developmental processes. In the wild-type OC, SGNII afferents make a characteristic 90-degree
turn toward the base of the cochlea and innervate multiple OHCs. In several PCP mutants, SGNII afferents turn
randomly towards either the cochlear base or the apex. Although it has been shown that PCP proteins localize
asymmetrically to supporting cell (SC)-SC junctions and act in the cochlear epithelium to guide SGNII afferents,
the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. Based on a strong foundation of preliminary data, we will
test the hypothesis that PCP signaling regulates multiple downstream effectors including adhesion molecules
and Rho GTPases to influence cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton in SCs, which serve as intermediate targets
of SGNIIs. Specifically, we found that PCP signaling regulates the localization of Nectin3, a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules, in SCs. Moreover, our preliminary data have suggested that
the Rac GTPases are required in the cochlear epithelium for SGNII afferent guidance; however, their constitutive
activity was insufficient to direct SGNII afferents when PCP signaling is disrupted. To test our hypothesis, Aim
1 seeks to elucidate the role of Nectin3 in SGNII afferent turning. To this end, we have generated Nectin3
knockout mice using CRISPR-Cas9. We will characterize Nectin3 mutant alleles and analyze SGNII afferent
turning in Nectin3 knockout mutants. Additionally, to determine whether Nectin3-mediated heterophilic adhesion
between SCs and SGNII afferents plays a role in their turning direction, we will test the effect of soluble Nectin3
ecto domain-Fc fusion proteins on SGNII axon outgrowth and turning in cochlear explants and dissociated SGN
cultures. Aim 2 will further investigate mutual regulation between Rac signaling activity and asymmetric PCP
protein localization, using a newly generated transgenic Rac1 activity reporter line and Rac conditional knockout
mutants. Furthermore, we will also determine whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase POSH/Sh3rf1, a known Rac1
downstream effector, is involved in SGNII afferent guidance using loss-of-function perturbations. Together, the
proposed experiments will provide novel insights into how PCP signaling directs polarized cell behaviors and fill
our knowledge gaps about SGNII wiring mechanisms in the mammalian cochlea."
10872283,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Clinical Core is an ideally-situated brain injury research hub, with state-of-the-science neuropsychological, 
electrophysiological and neuroimaging instrumentation to measure brain injury function and novel 
neurostimulation technologies for studies of brain injury recovery and repair. The Clinical Core is a 
collaborative, interdisciplinary environment providing expert guidance in research design and methods, critical 
support for patient recruitment, data collection and management to ensure reliability and reproducibility of 
results, and assistance with regulatory compliance using Good Clinical Practices. Collectively, this platform has 
unleashed the brain injury research potential at UNM to improve the outcomes of individuals with brain injuries. 
The Clinical Core has succeeded in propelling our young, promising investigators to independent research 
funding status and is now established as a national leader in research applying innovative neuromodulation 
approaches to therapeutically target and alter specific neural circuitries in individuals with neurological 
conditions. Overall, the goal of the Core in Phase II is to build on our Phase I accomplishments and continue 
our progress towards becoming a self-sustaining research enterprise that is independent of IDeA funding. We 
will continue to provide the resources and expertise to support innovative research that will accelerate a new 
cohort of Project Leads to independent funding and expand our mass of new and established clinical 
investigators as Core users on a fee for service basis. The Core will continue to invest in new instrumentation, 
advance our recruiting approaches and ensure tracking and reporting to Human Subjects System (HSS) and 
Clinical Trials.gov. The Clinical Core will continue to foster multidisciplinary collaboration between clinical and 
preclinical investigators within UNM and reach out to state and regional institutions to develop new 
partnerships and training collaborations as we seek to be a leading resource center for brain research. 
Through these efforts we will search for new interventions for brain and behavioral illnesses that will lead to 
improved outcomes for individuals with brain injury and their families."
10882761,"The overarching goal of this R01 is to explore the hypothesis that a prion-like mechanism of
proteopathic spread occurs in inclusion body myopathy (IBM). IBM patient muscle has two
distinct pathologies, 1) protein inclusions containing aggregated proteins such as TDP-43 and
desmin and 2) rimmed vacuoles consisting of autophagosomes, lysosomes and endosomes.
How these two pathologies are pathomechanistically connected is unclear. We suggest that
aggregated proteins such as TDP-43 and desmin enter the endolysosomal system damaging
the membrane leading to a failure in lysosomal degradation and signaling pathways resulting in
muscle degeneration. Our aims will test 1) confirm that muscle derived TDP-43 proteopathic
seeds can induce TDP-43 aggregation in recipient myofibers. 2) Demonstrate that proteopathic
seeds can induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization resulting in autophagic and lysosomal
dysfunction 3) Evaluate myofiber to myofiber propagation of proteopathic aggregates. Upon
completion of these aims, we will have defined a unique mechanism of IBM pathogenesis and
identified a novel point of therapeutic intervention by blocking the spread of protein aggregates."
10874920,"This proposal focuses on developing a novel specialized Magnetic Particle Imager. Magnetic Particle Imaging
(MPI) is an emerging non-invasive tomographic imaging modality; like CT or MRI, it could be applied in clinical
and research settings as a safe diagnostic technique, but without ionizing radiation or toxic tracers. One of the
major MPI challenges toward clinical translation has been the ability to scale up the coils to surround a human
body while being able to generate and drive the sufficiently strong magnetic field gradient required for high
spatial resolution. These requirements, however, demand prohibitively high power consumption in a device
with cylindrical geometry; therefore, alternative topologies, such as an open geometry scanner, would be highly
desirable. The goal of this renewal proposal is to develop a novel single-sided MPI imager and demonstrate in
vivo cancer imaging in rodents. The single-sided device has all the hardware on one side of the imaging
volume; therefore, such a device can be used equally well on small animals and humans for multidimensional
diagnostic imaging and as an MPI spectrometer (MPS). In our unique approach, we will develop a single-sided
MPI imager with much more promising field topology, namely, field-free line (FFL) as opposed to the more
common and relatively easier to implement field-free point (FFP) geometry, for a potential 10-fold increase of
SNR, more robust image reconstruction, and larger field of view.
To date, we have built a first prototype of a single-sided scanner with the FFL geometry that consists of all the
required coils in a unilateral configuration. We further validated our device by demonstrating 1D and 2D
imaging as well as high sensitivity signal detection using a point-source phantom. Developing a fully capable
3D scanner based on single-sided geometry has direct clinical relevance in breast cancer imaging.
We pursue two specific aims: 1) Develop a single-sided scanner for dynamic multislice 3D MPI imaging with
mechanical rotation. The main objective of this aim is to demonstrate 3D imaging with our MPI scanner. We
will upgrade the hardware and signal automation, such as the height control of the FFL for 3D imaging,
gradient strength adjustment, and imaging sequence. 2) Validate scanner performance in tumor-bearing mice
in in vivo imaging studies. The diagnostic capability of the MPI scanner, such as sensitivity and spatio-temporal
resolution, will be analyzed using functionalized and nonfunctionalized tracers.
The overall strength of the proposed research lies in developing the first ever MPI scanner with open geometry
that could potentially be translated to clinical settings. Specifically, we hope to deliver a more sensitive and
non-invasive tool for breast cancer screening that has a direct impact on women health."

Healthy Aging Behaviors and Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS) as it seeks to promote a sustained
research and infrastructure development program that leverages longitudinal data from observational and
interventional studies to examine how demographic and economic factors affect health-related behaviors
(HABs) and outcomes among older adults. ARSC PI and Center Co-PI David Meltzer will work closely with
fellow Co-PI Kathleen Cagney and the Executive Committee and External Advisory Board. These committees
will provide expertise in the demography and economics of aging, HABs, and longitudinal investigations, and
will represent diverse disciplines in the social and biological sciences, including economics, sociology, public
policy, internal medicine, and public health sciences. A Diversity Committee will also provide guidance to
CHABLIS in supporting research efforts of Center Associates and Affiliates from underrepresented
backgrounds. The main goals of the core include: 1) providing strategic vision, scientific leadership, and
administrative structure to the Center in order to foster active engagement of Center members, 2) providing
operational management for CHABLIS, including fiscal management and record keeping as well as tracking
outcomes for all cores for reporting requirements to the NIA and the Coordinating Center, 3) developing,
identifying, reviewing and monitoring pilot projects in a manner that is consistent with the overall goals of the
Center, and 4) providing a full suite of communication, research dissemination and support services to Center

10877926,"PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Program Development Core (PDC) will support the Center in the solicitation, review, selection, and
monitoring of pilot projects consistent with the goals of the overall Center and the NIA. The primary goals of the
PDC are: 1) to solicit a diverse range of pilot proposals from early career and other researchers that promote
innovative, population-based social science research in the longitudinal study of healthy aging behaviors
(HABs); 2) to review and select proposals with guidance from the Center’s Executive Committee (EC) and
External Advisory Board (EAB) in accordance with the goals of the Center; and 3) to provide monitoring and
ensure CHABLIS support to help pilot projects achieve their aims and obtain external funding.
 We propose four pilot projects in year 1 related to the Center theme of studying HABs through
observational and interventional studies:
1. The Rise and Consequences of Alternative Work Arrangements for the Aging Workforce; PI: Dmitri
 Koustas, PhD, Assistant Professor, Harris School of Public Policy
2. Impact of Pharmacogenetics in a High Utilizer Program for Older Adults at Increased Risk of
 Hospitalization. PI: Peter O’Donnell MD, Associate Professor, Dept of Medicine
3. The Significance of Race, Skin Color, and Discrimination for Health and Aging. PI: Ellis P. Monk,

NORC
4. Health Care Spending, Mortality and the Macroeconomic and Distributional Effects of Health
 Inequality at Older Ages, Greg Kaplan, PhD, Professor, Dept of Economics
 We believe that these four projects represent the breadth of opportunity at UChicago to examine issues
salient, and indeed critical, to older adult well-being. We highlight that three of the four pilots are led by junior
faculty. We also note that two of the four draw on NSHAP and one on CCP, both flagship projects at our
institution (and now linked through our External Innovative Network Core)."
10877927,"EXTERNAL INNOVATION NETWORK CORE: PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The overall goal of this External Innovative Network Core (EINC) is to develop innovative research networks on
longitudinal investigations of healthy aging behaviors (HABs) that enhance research within CHABLIS and the
broader research community. We will accomplish this through a) support of workshops and webinars; b)
collaboration on pilot projects and grant applications; c) harmonization of data collection across studies and
settings; and d) development and application of novel research resources (e.g., new survey instruments and
approaches to data analysis). This will be achieved through the CHABLIS Research Network (CHABLIS-RN)
that spans the Center’s activities. We will also engage in outreach activities that encourage and nurture the
development and diversity of researchers engaged in CHABLIS, to underrepresented minorities, people with
disabilities, and those from socially, culturally, economically, or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, and
will provide technical assistance to researchers in using CHABLIS data and resources.
To maximize CHABLIS’ impact, we propose to build both CHABLIS-RN, that will span the Center’s range of
activities, and more focused networks within CHABLIS-RN. As an example, we describe a Comprehensive
Care Research Network (CCRN) within CHABLIS-RN that will promote research on the Comprehensive Care
Physician (CCP) and Comprehensive Care Community and Culture (C4P) models. Findings to date suggest
CCP/C4P have exceptional potential to address medical and unmet social needs of older adults at increased
risk of hospitalization, with a broad range of research opportunities to better understand and maximize their
potential impact on older adults. CCP/C4P also provide rich opportunities to connect to other longitudinal
interventions to promote healthy aging, including a study we will soon begin of the effects of free dental care
for older adults and an ongoing study of the effects of preemptive pharmacogenetic testing on prescribing and
outcomes. One key goal is to introduce these novel data sources to demographers and economists whose
interests lie in health care experiences, and the potential of the health care setting to address the myriad
challenges related to socioeconomic disadvantage. Area-based studies such as CCP/C4P and national-
representative population based projects like the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) differ
in approach but, at their core, both aim to elucidate how, and to what extent, the social world matters for
health. We believe too little is shared between clinically oriented studies such as CCP/C4P and nationally-
representative social surveys such as NSHAP. We aim to amend that through the work of CHABLIS-RN."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This new proposed Core will support the work of the “Collaborative for Innovation in Data & Measurement in
Aging” (CIDMA) a collaboration of researchers at the University of Chicago (UChicago) Center for Healthy
Aging Behaviors and Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS) and the Duke Center for Population Health and
Aging (CPHA). This Collaborative Core will identify, design, conduct and assess innovations in data collection
and measurement for use in current and future data-focused studies of aging. These innovations in data
collection and measurement will be focused on the following issues: (a) adapting methods for measuring
cognition and brain functioning from laboratory to field settings; (b) extending place-based studies of activities
of individuals and their consequences for health and well-being from urban to rural settings; and (c) assessing
ways to improve the collection of survey data and data from health records in both hospital- and population-
based settings, with special emphasis on developing methods to improve subject recruitment and retention and
the use of adaptive consenting processes to establish trust. The assessments conducted by CIDMA will have
rapid turnaround, from design to dissemination of its findings (thus, we refer to them as Rapid Assessments).
These Rapid Assessments will be focused on developing measures and methods that are cost-effective and
that can be implemented in a range of settings, especially those “in the field” for population-based studies. The
members of CIDMA will work collaboratively on these tasks, drawing on both their particular expertise and
experience in data collection in studies of aging. This Core also will disseminate and educate the research
community on its findings. It will maintain an on-going dissemination effort of its findings and create a dialogue
between researchers and survey operations professionals, and their application to existing and future studies.
This Core also will conduct two summer institutes and an end-of-project symposium/workshop to train and
educate the next generation of researchers and data collection professionals in the study of aging."

Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by bilateral congenital cataracts
and glaucoma, renal tubular dysfunction, and mental retardation. Mutations in OCRL1, an inositol polyphosphate
5-phosphatase, cause Lowe syndrome. Despite the identification of OCRL1 as the causal gene underlying this
rare disease, there is currently no therapy for Lowe syndrome. Children with Lowe syndrome often go blind due
to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. We have developed a novel CRISPR-based approach to transcriptionally
regulate the inositol enzymes that control the substrate of OCRL. We have developed a nuclease-deficient Cas
protein that allows activation or inactivation of endogenous genes. Our preliminary data shows a novel
hypercompact CasMINI for gene editing in a single viral package that allows “Plug-and-Play” delivery. We also
established a nuclease-deficient CRISPR-CasMINI (dCasMINI) for gene transcriptional activation of protein
expression, with functional rescue in vivo. We also established human Lowe syndrome-based human iPS stem
cells, mouse and zebrafish models, and viral delivery approaches for in vivo therapies. We hypothesize that
CRISPR-Cas based rescue strategies for inositol 5-phosphatases will restore the imbalance due to the loss of
OCRL in Lowe syndrome. Our aims are to (1) transcriptionally activate a compensatory 5-phosphatase that
degrades PI(4,5)P2, (2) generate exon-skipping transcripts to reduce OCRL loss phenotypes in human iPS
models of Lowe syndrome, (3) use CRISPR-Pass strategy with both adenosine base editors and prime editors
to correct OCRL gene mutations in Lowe patient derived cells. We anticipate this work will provide critical insights
into how CRISPR-Cas can be used to rescue the loss of OCRL and provide important translation approaches
for Lowe syndrome and then expanded to treat other forms of inherited genetic eye diseases."

The broad, long-term objectives of the grant are to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
the gene x environment interactions that link developmental manganese (Mn) exposure, dopamine (DA)
dysregulation and increased frequency of ADHD diagnoses. Through the use of both sexes and varied genetic
backgrounds in our testing models (mice and human iPSC lines) we use a rigorous approach to deepen our
understanding of the role of genetics on the strength of the mechanisms under investigation. Strong
epidemiological and correlation evidence points to a relationship between overexposure to metals, including
Mn, and development of childhood and adolescent neuropsychological disorders. We will use oral exposures
to mimic exposure to Mn through poorly filtered water such as that obtained from wells, at levels relevant to
known human exposures in N. America. We will support our behavioral studies with comprehensive analyses
of dopaminergic (DAergic) function including post-mortem analyses of brain tissues, electrophysiology
approaches in live brain slices and in vitro study of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DA
neurons. Our first Specific Aim is to Determine the role of sex and genetic background on Mn exposure-
induced behavioral change and DAergic transport deficits. Three background strains have been selected for
their baseline differences in DAergic function, Mn metabolism and locomotor activity. Mice will be exposed to
control, moderate or high Mn through water from weaning to assess the impact of sub-toxic (i.e. no expected
cell death) Mn levels in brain during development. We will use a range of behavioral outcomes that are
representative of changes observed in ADHD as well as variation observed in the general public. We will study
DA metabolism and release/reuptake kinetics through neurochemistry, post translational protein modifications,
RNA and electrophysiology approaches. In Specific Aim 2 we will Test whether Mn modifies pharmacological
modulation of DA transport in vivo. We will use genetic approaches to generate mild disturbances in the
DAergic system from birth that cause only modestly altered phenotypes (behavioral and cellular). We will then
test whether Mn exposure is sufficient to drive these mild presentations towards full expression of abnormal
phenotypes mimicking a classic gene x environmental exposure model of development of Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities. We will further test the potential for Mn to impact efficacy of common treatments for
ADHD. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether Mn has an ADHD-related differential impact on DA
functional characteristics of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DAergic neurons. We will use
cell lines derived from males and females under baseline conditions, and following genetic mutation of the DA
transporter, or exposure to chemical ADHD risk factors. We will assess changes in neurochemistry and post-
translational modifications to test the potential translational relevance of Aims 1 and 2. We will use single-cell
genetic pathway analysis to test hypotheses about which pathways are disrupted by Mn."

Loss of ovarian hormones during menopause coincides with cognitive decline and increased risk of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Due to putative health risks associated with prolonged exposure to
estrogens, current guidelines recommend limiting hormone therapy to a few years to treat menopausal
symptoms. Work from our lab in rodent models of menopause has demonstrated long-lasting benefits of short-
term midlife estradiol treatment on hippocampal function and memory through sustained activation of estrogen
receptor (ER) α that are likely permanent, persisting long after the estradiol treatment is terminated. These
findings correspond with evidence across multiple species, including humans, that elevated levels of brain ERα
are associated with enhanced cognitive aging even in the absence of circulating estrogens. Mechanisms by
which increased levels of brain ERα enhance cognitive aging in females with a history of previous midlife
estradiol treatment is the broad focus of the current research. The overall hypothesis to be tested by the
current studies is that a short-term period of midlife estradiol treatment reverses the negative impact of long-
term hormone deprivation on hippocampal function by sustaining levels of brain-derived or neuroestrogens well
beyond the period of estradiol treatment. Sustained levels of neuroestrogens allows for insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) mediated activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway to predominate over the PI3K/Akt
pathway, which in turns allows for sustained, continued activation of ERα and subsequent regulation of ERα-
mediated genes and proteins important for memory. Guided by supporting data, this hypothesis will be tested
by three aims. In Aim 1, we will use a transgenic mouse model that allows for Cre-dependent site-specific
inactivation of ERK signaling to determine its role in the ability of IGF-1 to activate ERα and ERα-regulated
genes and proteins and impact memory. In Aim 2, we will use transgenic mouse models and viral vector
delivery of ERα to manipulate ERK and ERα signaling to determine the respective roles of ERK and ERα in the
ability of midlife estradiol exposure to impact hippocampal neuroestrogen synthesis long-term. In Aim 3, we will
use pharmacological manipulations to determine if the detrimental effects of long-term ovarian hormone
deprivation on the hippocampus and cognition can be reversed by altering the balance of IGF-1 mediated
signaling from PI3K/Akt to ERK/MAPK. Completion of the proposed aims is expected to have a positive impact
on the study of cognitive aging by elucidating mechanisms by which the postmenopausal cognitive aging
trajectory can be enhanced, results that have implications for preventing or delaying onset of Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias."
10883175,"Abstract
The bone marrow stroma and especially osteoblasts, are critical regulators of the development of hematological
myeloid malignancies, actively promoting their development or progression. Such tumorigenic properties of
osteoblasts can be pertinent in the context of highly relevant and frequent MDS (and AML) mutations that by
themselves are not sufficient to induce disease. One such prominent case are gain-of-function mutations in
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) drive the synthesis of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)
which induces chromatin abnormalities, including globally altered histone and DNA methylation profiles in MDS
(and AML) cells. However, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are not by themselves sufficient to cause MDS. In addition,
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are detected in expanded clones in aging healthy humans, a phenomenon termed
“age related clonal hematopoiesis” that confers increased risk for MDS and AML development. These
observations suggest a) that IDH1/2 mutations require additional cooperative signals to become fully
transforming; and b) that such signals may accumulate with aging and potentiate the transformation to MDS (or
AML). In investigating this possibility in IDH1/2-mutant MDS/AML, we found that D2HG is elevated in the bone
marrow plasma of MDS patients carrying IDH mutations as compared to MDS patients without such mutations
leading to differential hypermethylation in the stroma of IDH1 and IDH2-mutant patients as compared to IDH1
and IDH2 wild type patients. Integrative analysis of these results with RNAseq data from the same subjects and
preliminary in vivo analysis suggests stromal cell candidate genes that affect IDH1/2-related transformations.
Importantly, hypermethylation of these molecules increases in osteoblasts with aging and also presents in
subjects with IDH1/2 age related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). In addition, it correlates with resistance to IDH2
inhibitor treatment in patients. We hypothesize that D2HG uptaken by bone marrow stroma leads to
hypermethylation in ARCH subjects and with aging. In turn, signals from hypermethylated genes in osteoblasts,
act on HSCs harboring IDH1/2 mutations to promote their expansion and transformation to MDS. We will
delineate how epigenetically modified mouse and human stromal cells and osteoblasts promote transformation
of IDH2 mutant HSCs to MDS/AML; Determine whether clonal expansion is the mechanism through which
epigenetic modifications in aging bone marrow stroma and osteoblasts supports ARCH-related transformation
of IDH2-mutant HSCs to MDS/AML-initiating cells; Evaluate the role of stroma hypermethylation in resistance to
IDH-inhibitor treatment in patients and in overcoming IDH-inhibitor resistance in mice; Confirm identified and
uncover additional stromal components of IDH1/2 transformation. These studies will identify osteoblast-derived
signals that may be targeted therapeutically alone or in combination with current IDH1/2 inhibitors to improve
treatment of IDH1/2 mutant MDS/AML patients or, in the future, to prevent disease development."

This application to renew our participation in the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis,
Diabetes and Pancreas Cancer (CPDPC), will enable the Stanford Clinical Center to continue its
productive recruitment of patients into four key clinical studies of the consortium – 1) Prospective
Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for Epidemiologic and Translational Studies (PROCEED), 2)
Pediatric Longitudinal Cohort Study of Chronic Pancreatitis [The International Study Group of
Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure (INSPPIRE2), 3) Prospective Study to Establish a New
Onset Diabetes Cohort (NOD), and 4) Evaluation of a mixed meal test for Diagnosis and
characterization of Pancreaticogenic Diabetes secondary to pancreatic cancer and chronic
pancreatitis (DETECT). Prospectively collected specimens from these studies will be used to further
examine the role of the immune system in chronic pancreatitis and its relationship to the development
of diabetes and pancreas cancer.
In response to the research objectives of the CPDPC Consortium as outlined in this RFA, we have
formed a strong scientific team with broad complementary expertise in clinical adult and pediatric
pancreatitis, endocrinology, radiology, primary care, and immunology. Our proposal is highly
responsive to the RFA in several specific ways. As part of the original Consortium, our Clinical Center,
has demonstrated capacity to effectively recruit patients into 4 primary studies of the CPDPC. We
have successfully used archived specimens to demonstrate potential immune signals to diagnose
chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. In this renewed proposal, we intend to continue to validate
these studies using prospectively collected samples from the prospective longitudinal cohorts of this
consortium. We hope to ultimately develop and validate cytokine profiles that may facilitate diagnosis
of chronic pancreatitis, predict likelihood of associated complications, and lead to targets to support
clinical trials to halt fibrosis. For pancreas cancer, these studies may lead to novel diagnostic tests to
detect pancreatic cancer at earlier stages. The opportunity to further investigate and validate these
novel observations in collaboration with other centers remains an exciting opportunity to change
diagnosis and patient management for chronic pancreatitis and its associated complications of
pancreatogenic diabetes and pancreas cancer development."
10884472,"Project Summary
The intervertebral disc has a mechanical function, with degeneration and aging the disc structure and function
are altered which can cause low back pain. Imaging is often used to evaluate disc structure and health via disc
grading schemes but fail to identify clinically relevant disc changes. This may be due to the lack of mechanical
function assessment in static MRI imaging. There is a critical need to measure disc mechanical function in vivo
and evaluate disc health by functional capacity to diagnose and treat spine pathology.
Mechanical function has been evaluated in cadaver models, but the relationship between the in vivo and
cadaveric states is purely speculative, due to the lack of common reference state and unknown differences
between them. The boundary and loading conditions of the in vivo condition have not been quantified and
therefore cannot be replicated in cadaveric tests or finite element models (FEM). The objective of this proposal
is to quantify the disc’s mechanical function in vivo, establish a function-based disc grading scheme,
and create an in vivo human disc FEM. I will measure in vivo disc strain, use an animal model to establish a
translational matrix between in vivo and cadaveric conditions, and use a FEM to predict the disc’s internal
mechanical state in vivo.
Aim 1: Quantify Mechanical Function of Human In Vivo Disc with Degeneration and Aging
Current disc grading schemes are structure-based and cannot distinguish normal aging and degeneration from
disc pathology; I will use multi-positional MRI to assess in vivo disc function and a statistical model to establish
a novel multi-factorial disc grading scheme.
Aim 2: Establish a Translational Matrix Between In Vivo and Cadaver States in a Porcine Model
An animal model will be used to conduct paired MRI quantifications between in vivo and cadaver conditions.
Ex vivo mechanical testing and paired in vivo FEM will enable further comparison between conditions. These
quantifications will allow me to establish a translation matrix between the in vivo and cadaveric states.
Aim 3: Create and Validate In Vivo Human Disc FEM
MRI loading data from Aim 1, transformation matrix from Aim 2 and a previously validated disc model will be
used to create and validate an in vivo human disc FEM for evaluating the internal mechanics of the in vivo disc.
This study will yield a function-based disc grading scheme to replace prior structure-based schemes. It will
establish a transformation matrix between in vivo and cadaveric states, an essential step for interpreting
research data in the in vivo context and for appropriate setup for ex vivo mechanical testing and FEM. The
main impact of this work will be the methods and techniques needed for research to investigate disc pathology
and in the long term, clinical tools for the diagnosis and assessment of treatment options for low back pain."
10884473,"Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program Data Coordinating Center—Project Summary
Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on society. Physical and cognitive decline limit
the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of,
cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with
extended resistance to decline and disease should be a major objective of current medical research.
Fortunately, tremendous progress has been made in the biology of aging field and the science is poised to be
translated into preclinical and clinical science.
Simple animal models such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been at the heart of this success.
Many genes and chemical compound interventions that modulate aging processes are likely to act similarly in
humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group
involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for their
ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated
super-group is to test promising compound on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus,
which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that
treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being
effective in humans.
The Data Coordinating Center supports work at all three project sites by creating a centralized data repository
(currently 400,000 longevity records), uniform analytical pipelines, and public-facing repositories and websites.
The emphasis of this specific proposal is to (1) maintain and enhance a central data repository to support the
work of all CITP labs, (2) generate standardized open-source analytical framework for all CITP data analysis,
(3) develop comprehensive database and analytical framework for novel hallmarks of aging and healthspan,
and (4) develop a public and private online portal of lifespan and healthspan data.
Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions
that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of
therapies that promote healthy human aging."

Rican migrants. Puerto Ricans are the second-largest Latinx group in the United States (US) and have the
highest rates of behavioral health (BH) disorders among Latinx heritage groups. There is evidence that this
may be due to the circular migration patterns that result from Puerto Ricans having US citizenship, which
entails frequent disruptions to social networks. At the same time, Latinxs utilize BH services at lower rates than
non-Latinxs, suggested a significant unmet treatment need. This study will investigate how the social
relationships of post-Maria Puerto Rican migrants 1) influence perceived need for treatment and 2) influence
service utilization. The results of the study can be used to inform culturally-congruent outreach efforts and BH
services and suggest routes to reduce future BH treatment gaps with Latinx (im)migrant populations. The
proposed study will have both quantitative and qualitative components. It will use prospective survey data from
the parent study – the Adelante Boricua project – to determine salient social relationship influences on BH
treatment outcomes. Qualitative interviews conducted for the proposed study will then explore in depth the
associations between social relationships and BH treatment outcomes found in the quantitative aims. In
addition to the proposed study, the training plan for this fellowship will provide a variety of opportunities to
develop as a well-rounded, community-engaged health services researcher. These opportunities include
advanced coursework to develop substantive and methodological knowledge, interdisciplinary team-based
research experience, and mentored practice in working effectively with community advisory boards. The
sponsor and co-sponsor both have extensive expertise with Latinx populations, including behavioral health
(sponsor) and systems navigation (co-sponsor). They are supported by the institutional environment of the
Boston College School of Social Work, which has a cadre of researchers who focus on Latinx and immigrant
populations and a wealth of resources for conducted community-engaged research. The sponsorship team and
institutional environment are ideal for completing the proposed study and training plan for this fellowship."

10882377,"Project Summary/Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes is facultative intracellular food-borne pathogen that provides an extremely
amenable model for basic studies on host-pathogen interactions. During past funding periods, genetic
screens led to the discovery that L. monocytogenes upregulates the expression and synthesis of glutathione
synthase (GshF) during infection and that glutathione is an allosteric activator of the major virulence
transcription factor, PrfA. Mutants lacking GshF fail to fully activate PrfA and consequently form small
plaques in tissue culture cells and are approximately 200-fold less virulent in mice. However, virulence of
gshF mutants was fully rescued by mutations that locked PrfA in its active configuration, referred to as PrfA*
mutants. During the current funding period, we designed a genetic screen with the goal of identifying
additional transposon mutants that formed small plaques in tissue culture cells, but were restored to a wild-
type phenotype when the mutation was transduced into a PrfA* background. In addition to finding the
expected gshF mutants, we found mutants in gloA, which encodes glyoxalase A, the primary component
necessary for the glutathione-dependent detoxification of the reactive electrophilic species (RES),
methylglyoxal (MGO), which is a toxic side-product of glycolysis in both bacteria and host cells. Mutants
lacking gloA were approximately 1000-fold less virulent in mice and like gshF mutants, were restored to full
virulence in a PrfA* background, suggesting that MGO is an in vivo cue leading to GshF synthesis and
activation of PrfA. MGO reacts with both amino acids and guanine causing DNA damage and mutations. In
preliminary data, we confirmed that gloA mutants had a 10-fold increase in their mutation rate when
exposed to MGO in vitro, but strikingly, the mutation rate of gloA mutants was approximately 100-1000-fold
higher in the spleens and livers of infected mice, suggesting that the in vivo environment encountered by L.
monocytogenes is enriched in MGO and consequently highly mutagenic. Double gloA/prfA* mutants were
not only fully virulent, they did not suffer increased mutation rates in vivo, suggesting that in the absence of
GloA, activated PrfA protects against DNA damage by a yet-to-be discovered mechanism. Based on the
literature, we hypothesized that DNA damage caused by MGO was repaired by UvrAB-dependent
nucleotide excision repair pathway. Astonishingly, a uvrAB mutation rescued the virulence defect of gloA
mutants, but unlike PrfA* mutants, gloA/uvrAB mutants still had an extremely high mutation rate. These data
suggest that gloA mutants suffer severe DNA damage in vivo and are killed by the resultant DNA repair
process. In this renewal, we propose to characterize the in vivo environment that causes such a high rate of
mutations in gloA mutants, determine how PrfA mediates GloA-independent protections from MGO, and
lastly explore the hypothesis that gloA mutants are killed by their own DNA repair process."

Understanding cell identities and their spatial distributions throughout different regions of the human brain is a
fundamental step when trying to integrate physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and molecular data. At
present, although major categories of the cell-types present in the human brain have been defined molecularly,
the different subtypes within these categories along with their locations are far from understood. Gene expression
drives cell programs and states that underlie distinct brain functions. Open chromatin and modified histones
mark gene-regulatory elements that control cell type-specific gene expression patterns. Cytosine DNA
methylation (mC) is a stable epigenomic signature that persists in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime,
defining their cellular identity. Single-cell gene expression, open chromatin profiles and DNA methylation assays
have been successfully used to identify distinct cell types in an unbiased fashion in heterogeneous tissues
including the human brain. This UM1 proposal builds on our earlier successes in mouse brain mapping to
produce detailed single-cell multimomic and spatial cell maps at the single-cell level across 100 anatomically
defined regions in the human brain. Profiling human brain samples will permit the discovery of unique gene
expression patterns for each molecularly-defined cell type, identify their spatial organization, and their specific
non-coding DNA regulatory regions. Multi-modal integration between epigenomic and transcriptomic signatures
will allow the identification of new cell types and unique cell-type markers that will rapidly be made available to
the entire community. This UM1 project will also provide new tools for genetic access of previously inaccessible
brain regions as well as facilitate the functional analysis of genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric and
neurological disorders."
10882058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognitive abilities have a profound impact on life outcomes. As such, there has been much scientific interest in
identifying genes that are critical for regulating cognitive phenotypes. The miR-132 microRNA is among the few
studied microRNAs that impacts learning and memory in rodents, is dysregulated in multiple human disorders
typified by cognitive impairment, and regulates synaptic structure and function. Human genome wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes of potential relevance to general cognitive function, yet a
challenge is identifying which genes, among the many, are likely to have direct effects on learning and memory.
Genes that are targets of miR-132, and that have also been identified in GWAS of human cognitive function,
could have a high likelihood of directly impacting learning and memory. The overlay of empirically identified high
probability miR-132 gene targets with a list of genes that exhibit genome-wide significant association with human
cognitive abilities lead to the identification of two genes, one of which is ARHGEF11. ARHGEF11 encodes PDZ-
RhoGEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RhoA small GTPase. Within the brain, PDZ-
RhoGEF is most highly detected in the cerebral cortex, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). PDZ-RhoGEF is
enriched in the dendrites and dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons, with minimal detectable expression in glia.
Despite being among the most potent known activators of RhoA, no studies have investigated the functions of
PDZ-RhoGEF in the brain. One overarching theory guiding this proposal is that PDZ-RhoGEF is a critical
regulator of dendrite and dendritic spine stability, and that it also regulates synaptic function, neuronal
engagement and cognition. A second overarching theory guiding this proposal is that PDZ-RhoGEF is a
previously unrecognized component of multiple signaling pathways of known importance for controlling synaptic
and cognitive phenotypes. Aim 1 will use viral-mediated gene transfer to determine if increased levels of PDZ-
RhoGEF in the prefrontal cortex affects synaptic structure, synaptic function, neuronal engagement, and
cognition in a manner that requires RhoA activation. Aim 2 will determine if the effects of altered miR-132
expression on dendritic spine stability and cognition are due, at least in part, to miR-132's ability to control levels
of PDZ-RhoGEF. As part of the experimental design of Aim 2, we will also simultaneously determine the effects
of PDZ-RhoGEF knockdown in the mouse prefrontal cortex on baseline dendritic spine and cognitive
phenotypes. Aim 3 will use enzyme activity assessments, super resolution synaptic imaging, and viral gene
transfer to characterize the physical and functional interaction between PDZ-RhoGEF and the scaffolding-like
protein DISC1. As part of Aim 3, we will determine if the effects of DISC1 loss on synapse destabilization and
cognitive impairment are due to excessive PDZ-RhoGEF activity. If our hypotheses are correct, these studies
could identify a previously unrecognized role for PDZ-RhoGEF in controlling synaptic and cognitive phenotypes
via multiple signaling pathways, and illuminate RhoA signaling as a target for future therapeutics."

How accurate cell fate specification occurs in the context of dynamic tissue-scale
rearrangements is one of the most exciting questions in developmental biology. In
this proposal we aim at deciphering the interplay between fate acquisition,
patterning and morphogenesis of the ectodermal germ layer in the context of
human neurulation. We have recently developed a robust protocol which allows
for the generation of extremely reproducible human neuruloids: self-organized
human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) assemblies that recapitulate the organization
of the ectodermal compartment at neurulation stages by organizing neural, neural
crest, placodes and epidermis populations within the same colony on adhesive
micropatterns. This self-organization is extremely reproducible and can be
quantified with sub-cellular resolution and in real time over hundreds of colonies.
Armed with this novel technology, we propose three specific aims. The first is to
unravel the mechanism of cell-cell signaling driving self-organization. The second
is to integrate signaling with fate acquisition and morphogenesis through live
reporter imaging and time dependent single cell RNAseq. Finally, the third aim
focuses on the full characterization of the origin and sub-populations of ectodermal
derivatives and their in vivo validation by performing side by side comparisons with
stage-matched marmoset fetal samples and grafting experiments in chick
embryos. The generation of large numbers of homogenous human neuruloids,
where self-organization of ectodermal fate can be followed dynamically for a period
of one week, with sub-cellular resolution, not only solves the inherent
heterogeneity observed in cerebral organoids, but provides us a unique
opportunity to study these events in models of human embryos. This will have a
high impact in both basic research as well as clinical application, a prospect
already on the horizon.

In highly structured organs, cells are arranged in precise patterns with each cell occupying a defined
position and performing a specific function. Thus, there is an intimate linkage between a cell’s
position and its fate. The mechanisms that regulate position usually involve changes in cell affinities
and movement of cells, whereas the processes of fate assignment involve
the execution of specific programs of cellular differentiation. This raises the question of how at the
molecular level the mechanisms that determine position are integrated with those that determine
fate. This proposal uses the developing Drosophila ommatidium as a model system with which to
study the linkage between cell position and fate. Ommatidia grow by recruiting cells to precise
positions in their structure, and the cell fate specifications depends on the cells they contact. The
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase and Notch signaling pathways play key roles in ommatidial development,
and in this work we test whether these two pathways control both the recruitment and cell fate
specifications. Specifically, we ask whether the recruitment and fate specification steps represent
early and late aspects of the same signaling process."

10887546,"PROJECT 1 | SUMMARY
Tracheal esophageal birth defects (TEDs) occur when the separation of the trachea and esophagus from the
common foregut is disrupted during early fetal development. TEDs often present at birth without a prenatal
diagnosis and if left uncorrected, TEDs disrupt proper breathing and/or feeding and are usually life threatening.
Even when corrected surgically, they are often associated with long-term comorbidity. Although there is
compelling evidence for a major genetic component, the etiology of TEDs is largely unknown. About 50 candidate
mutations have been associated with TEDs with varying degrees of confidence, but only a 20 of these genes
are conclusively causative in TEDs. We hypothesize that there are unique genetic mutations that cause
TEDs and that these act in distinct developmental pathways to determine the TED anatomical phenotype,
associated anomalies, and the clinical outcome of these patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that pre-
repair and early post- repair anatomic, genetic, surgical, and clinical variables can be used to predict
short and long-term clinical features and clinical outcomes in TED patients to advance treatment
strategies. Our understanding of the clinical pathology of TEDs has been hampered by the lack of a detailed
large scale genetic, anatomic, and clinical investigation of this patient population. Therefore, the primary goal of
this project is to improve our understanding of the genetic and anatomic basis of TEDs in order to enhance
diagnosis, determine factors that influence prognosis and advance treatment strategies. The second goal is to
serve as catalyst for the developmental biology studies in Projects 2 and 3 through the creation of a
comprehensive database that will integrate anatomic phenotype, genotype, and clinical outcome data.
Aim 1: Maintain and expand the multi-center TED phenotype-genotype registry.
Aim 2: Identify new TED risk genes and variants by statistical analysis of de novo and rare inherited variants and
integrative analysis with data from other developmental disorders and single cell functional genomics."

Dietary protein is a powerful determinant of the biological state and represents a vital element in a comprehensive
geroprotective therapy. Several groups have demonstrated that the manipulation of dietary protein levels can
directly influence the aging process. Specifically, the reduction of protein intake (PR) robustly enhances
metabolic health, promotes healthspan, and extends lifespan. Unpublished data from the Lamming Lab further
demonstrates in an early onset model of Alzheimer’s disease (3xTg-AD) that PR improves glucose tolerance,
reduces tau hyperphosphorylation, and ameliorates cognitive deficits. However, a recent conflicting report
suggests that a high protein diet can reduce the accumulation of Aβ in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
patients. This indicates that further understanding of PR’s molecular mechanisms is necessary to appreciate the
true contribution of dietary protein in the aging process. In investigating the components of a PR diet, the
Lamming Lab has reported that isoleucine restriction (IleR) alone can effectively recapitulate PR’s benefits and
is required for a significant portion of PR’s effects. To further understand the role of IleR as a geroprotective
therapy, young C57BL/6J male mice were fed an IleR diet and concurrently treated with rapamycin, which is a
well-studied life-extending drug with proven benefits in AD mouse models. Surprisingly, rapamycin largely
overtook the short-term effects of the diet, blocking IleR’s benefits in body composition, glucose tolerance, and
energy expenditure. At the molecular level, rapamycin specifically prevented the induction of lipolytic programs
and not of thermogenesis or lipogenesis in the inguinal white adipose tissue. Lipolysis and lipid regulation plays
a critical role in the systemic state of metabolism. While the effect of PR on brain lipid regulation is unknown,
recent publications have found that dysfunctions in lipolysis is associated with AD progression. As such, this
proposal investigates the overarching hypothesis that lipolysis regulation is a critical mechanism of action in the
physiological role of dietary protein, with a focus on healthspan, lifespan, and cognitive health. Aim 1 will define
the metabolic and molecular interactions between rapamycin and various dietary restrictions and investigate the
role of dietary protein concentrations on the life-extending effects of rapamycin. Aim 2 will leverage transgenic
mouse lines with genetic ablation of putative rapamycin targets in order to dissect the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the effects of PR. Aim 3 will determine the role of dietary protein on the development of AD
symptoms and on the effects of rapamycin in the early onset 3xTg-AD and the late onset hAβ-AD mouse models.
We will further characterize changes of the lipidomic profile in the serum and the brain. In summary, this research
program seeks to provide significant advancements in our mechanistic understanding of the role of dietary
protein in the biology of aging as well as in the manifestation of AD pathogenesis."
10887192,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spinal cord injury in mammals triggers a cascade of cellular events that lead to the loss of sensory and motor
function caudal to the site of injury. Following spinal cord injury, immune cells, including microglia and
macrophages, infiltrate into the lesion site and become activated. Depleting microglia and macrophages in
mammalian systems has shown both beneficial and detrimental effects post-injury. Identifying the specific
regenerative immune requirements in mammalian systems has proven difficult due to a complex combination of
anti-regenerative barriers. In contrast, zebrafish spontaneously regenerate a fully severed spinal cord and
provide a platform for identifying pathways necessary for spinal cord regeneration. The zebrafish immune system
is conserved with mammals, and therefore provides a unique system to identify pro-regenerative immune
pathways. In preliminary data, I found microglia and macrophages are necessary for functional and anatomical
recovery post-injury, but the pathways directing microglia/macrophage-dependent spinal cord regeneration are
not known. Microglia and macrophages are highly plastic cells, and their gene expression and behavior have
direct implications on functional outcomes following neural injury. This proposal will identify microglia/
macrophage-specific cellular identities, gene expression, and pathways that are necessary for spinal cord
regeneration in the adult zebrafish. First, two of the most important functions of microglia and macrophages
following spinal cord injury are to direct the healing of injured tissue and clear the lesion site of cellular debris.
Aim 1 (K99 Phase) will utilize loss-of-function mutants to define genes upstream of wound healing that are
necessary for re-establishing immune privilege of the spinal cord after injury. Aim 2 (K99/R00 Phase) will move
from the adult zebrafish spinal cord to a human cell culture system to visualize behavior in human iPSC-derived
microglia and test the conservation of pro-regenerative gene function in human cells. Lastly, the origin of immune
cells will dictate their cellular function and effect on regeneration, and the origins of pro-regenerative microglia
and macrophages are unknown. In Aim 3 (R00 Phase), I will perform lineage tracing in the adult zebrafish
regenerating spinal cord to characterize the origin of expanding immune cells post-injury. These Aims are
designed to apply my strengths in zebrafish genetics and regeneration to the new field of neuroimmunology. To
facilitate my ability to carry out these proposed experiments, I have assembled a team of advisors and
collaborators, taking advantage of the vibrant neural injury and neuroimmunology communities at Washington
University School of Medicine. This proposal will generate novel tools and protocols to measure the immune
events during spinal cord regeneration and offers a foundational niche in the spinal cord injury field through
which I can launch a future tenure-track research faculty position. Additionally, work proposed here will identify
pro-regenerative pathways that have direct relevance to human health and provide potential therapies for human
spinal cord injury patients."

Periodontal disease is mediated by the dynamic interplay between host inflammation and changes in
subgingival biofilm community composition. The keystone pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis is known to
subvert the immune response to promote inflammation and favorable conditions for pathobiont organisms,
while inhibiting immune system clearance of bacteria. Because of this, P. gingivalis has been proposed to
initiate periodontal disease. Here we propose a new paradigm for the initiation of periodontal disease,
mediated at the gingival margin by long filamentous cells that bring plaque organisms into close or direct
contact with the epithelium to initiate inflammation in the form of gingivitis. This reversible inflammatory state
then induces dysbiosis in the subgingival community. We will test our hypothesis by imaging intact biofilms on
extracted teeth involved in gingivitis and periodontitis, including the biofilm at the gingival margin with FISH
probes for up to 18 different taxa. We will further perform quantitative comparative structural analyses of
periodontitis associated human biofilms and canine models to specifically identify conserved structural features
of pathogenic subgingival biofilms. Lastly, we will map the spatial location of differentially expressed genes
within filamentous cells in plaque biofilms when these cells are in direct or close contact with specific partner
species. This work will comprise a holistic approach to identify structure-function relationships in healthy and
periodontal disease-associated biofilms that underly periodontal disease initiation and progression."
10887730,"The United States is in the midst of an opioid addiction crisis, with exposure rates to opioids estimated to be
over 3.3% of the population in 2021 alone. In addition to the devastating consequences to the current
population, which include addiction, overdose, lost productivity, socioeconomic burdens, and social and familial
deterioration, a growing body of evidence indicates that opioid exposure will also affect subsequent
generations and contributes to the inheritance of increased susceptibility to develop opioid use disorder. Using
a rat model, we recently demonstrated that adolescent exposure to opioids increases addiction-like behaviors
in offspring (F1). In addition, we observe changes in the endogenous opioid system at early developmental
timepoints in these rats. The endogenous opioid system plays a critical role in many functions including
regulation of pain, immune response, gastrointestinal motility, and response to drugs of abuse. The
experiments proposed here will examine potential mechanisms underlying transmission of environmental
exposure to opioids in sires to offspring. Paternal transmission is ideal because the confound of gestational
and rearing environment is mitigated, as the only contribution from the sire is semen. Semen, and specifically
spermatozoa represent a cell type that undergoes vast epigenetic modifications and is well poised to carry
environmental changes to the oocyte where it can regulate fetal development. Indeed, a growing body of
evidence suggests that micro RNAs (miRNA) within sperm are one potential carrier by which changes in one
generation may affect the next. Recently, it was shown that exposure to morphine increases the expression of
a let-7, which is a family of highly conserved miRNAs. Let-7 in turn, was shown to regulate the expression of
opioid receptors. The goal of this grant is to utilize our rat model of familial inheritance of opioid use disorder to
test the role of let-7 in the transmission of increased susceptibility to self-administer oxycodone. In Aim 1 we
will use miRNA inhibitors in sperm combined with artificial insemination to test if let-7 plays a role in the
transmission of the behavioral phenotype observed in our model. We have preliminary data that demonstrates
increased levels of let-7 in sperm as well as dysregulation of opioid receptors at early developmental
timepoints. We predict that decreasing let-7 in sperm will rescue the molecular and behavioral phenotypes in
F1 offspring. In Aim 2 we will test if the consequences of male adolescent opioid exposure extend to the next
generation by measuring the self-administration behavior of the grand offspring (F2). These animals had no
direct exposure to opioids. We predict that they will demonstrate increased oxycodone self-administration. The
data that will be produced from the proposed experiments will directly test the role of let-7 as a mechanism of
transmission of behavioral phenotypes associated with paternal opioid exposure. In addition, these
mechanisms can be expanded more broadly and represent means by which environmental stimuli can impact
phenotypic variation of future progeny."

In the current state, clinical airway management decisions for patients with upper airway obstruction (UAO) are
made based on a combination of qualitative imaging modalities, clinician experience, and a limited number of
physiologic measures. Available diagnostics are inadequate and do not take into account the critical, dynamic
nature of the respiratory cycle. Our goal is to create patient specific, quantitative, data driven metrics for
stratifying the severity of UAO for use in clinical decision making. The upper airway (nares to larynx) consists
of dynamic structures that change throughout the respiratory cycle. Robin Sequence (RS) is a potentially fatal
congenital craniofacial condition characterized by undersized jaw, posteriorly displaced tongue, and resultant
UAO. We chose to focus our initial efforts on RS patients due to the consistent clinical phenotype. Treatment
options for patients with RS range from conservative measures such as prone positioning to invasive and
morbid surgical procedures. Clinical decisions for RS patients with UAO are made based on static imaging
studies obtained at a random phase in the respiratory cycle, subjective interpretation of awake flexible airway
endoscopy, blood CO2 levels, polysomnograms, the treatment team’s clinical impression of the patient’s
condition and the family’s goals of care. The factors contributing to clinical decisions are numerous but heavily
influenced by multiple sources of bias based on the resources available at the treatment facility and the clinical
training background/composition of the care team. There is a clear, unmet clinical need for a diagnostic
modality that can both characterize the anatomic narrowing and quantify UAO. We plan to address this need
by integrating computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling with a novel computed tomography protocol that
captures dynamic airway changes throughout the respiratory cycle (4D-CT). In the future state, we anticipate
the 4D-CT/CFD-based diagnostic modality will be used to define the anatomic location(s) of dynamic UAO and
quantify the severity of the UAO at each level. This information will be used, in part, to determine which
treatment is optimal for individual patients. As part of this work, we will define specific CFD and clinical
outcome measures that are most critical to UAO treatment decisions. Preliminary data shows that the CFD
analysis output (breathing resistance, energy loss, peak velocity) can identify the level(s) and severity of airway
compromise. The aims of this proposal are to further develop, refine and validate the technique for integrating
4D-CT acquisition with CFD analysis to ultimately inform treatment decisions in infants with UAO. By
combining 4D-CT imaging with CFD techniques, we aim to create a simple, accurate, quantitative, patient
specific diagnostic modality that will address the current gap. Once validated in RS patients this diagnostic
approach could be applied to numerous other conditions impacted by UAO including obstructive sleep apnea
and laryngomalacia."

The goal of the proposed research is to discover how variation in the number of corticospinal neurons
(CSNs) causes variation in motor circuit function and dexterous behavior, thus linking cells, circuits,
and behavior in the same system. The evolution of advanced cognitive and motor function is associated with
cerebral cortex expansion, including expansion of CSN neuron number, and it has long been hypothesized that
the expansion of CSNs in primates underlies their exquisite hand dexterity, such as that required for tool use.
In support of this, lesioning studies have demonstrated a role for motor cortex, and CSNs in particular, in
dexterous behaviors. However, CSN number has not been causally linked to dexterity, nor do we understand
the basic principles of how expanding a cell population alters circuit activity and thus behavior. The
experiments proposed here will test the hypothesis that animals with more CSNs have greater
dexterity, thus synthesizing cellular, circuit-level, and behavioral discovery, thus achieving the Goal 7
of the BRAIN Initiative. Specifically, this research will compare subspecies of deer mice (Peromyscus
maniculatus) that evolved in different habitats and have innate differences in dexterity as well as a difference in
CSN number. First, it will use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize which population(s) of CSNs
differ in abundance between subspecies and to identify candidate developmental mechanisms underlying CSN
population expansion. (Aim 1). At the circuit level, this research will determine whether neural activity during a
dexterity task and neural architecture, as assessed with viral tracing, differs between subspecies (Aim 2).
Finally, in the candidate’s independent research program (R00 phase), she will use the tools and datasets
generated in Aims 1 and 2 to manipulate CSNs to establish causal links between CSN number, neural activity,
and dexterity (Aim 3). This project will take advantage of recent technological advances in high throughput
experiments (e.g., single nucleus sequencing) and neural manipulation (e.g., virally delivered gene editing) to
work in a non-traditional model system, affording the unique ability to capitalize on naturally evolved behavioral
differences to elucidate general principles of how cellular and neural variation mediate behavioral variation.
This research is part of a comprehensive training plan that combines training in comparative behavior,
developmental and systems neuroscience, and computational analysis of datasets in these areas, as well as
training in communication and mentoring. This plan will be mentored by Dr. Hopi Hoekstra at Harvard
University, an expert in deer mouse comparative behavior, and Dr. Adam Hantman at the University of North
Carolina Chapel Hill, an expert in the neuroscience of motor systems. Additional mentorship will come from an
Advisory Committee in single cell sequencing analysis, developmental neuroscience, and analysis of neural
recording data. Together, this opportunity will provide excellent training for an independent research career in a
unique, interdisciplinary niche at the interface of molecular neuroscience, behavior, and evolutionary biology."
10888311,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an insidious neurodegenerative disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion
in exon 1 of the gene that codes for Huntingtin (mHtt). The pathogenic mechanisms underlying HD remain poorly
understood. Studies of HD models have documented numerous developmental impairments during ‘pre-
manifest’ HD. Using conditional HD models, the Mehler laboratory team has previously shown that such
developmental processes mediate disease pathogenesis. Now, this team provides evidence demonstrating that
interneuron neurogenesis is prominently disrupted in mouse models of HD, leading to deficits in the complement
of these interneurons within the developing cerebral cortex. Such deficits are of great importance, as studies
have shown these lead to permanent changes in cortico-striatal connectivity laying the foundation for cortical
hyperexcitability, impaired excitation-inhibition coupling, and striatal excitotoxic stress later in life. Although
cortical interneuron deficits have previously been reported in HD cases, their role in HD pathogenesis has never
been further interrogated. This application tests the central hypothesis that HD is caused by impairments in the
developmental elaboration of selective cortical interneuron subtypes; therefore, prevention of the adverse
developmental effects of these interneuron deficits will ameliorate or even prevent disease occurrence. This
hypothesis is further supported by preliminary data showing that genetic rescue of developing interneurons
precludes the onset of characteristic features of HD in BACHD mice: motor coordination deficits, hypomyelination
of subcortical white matter tracts and striatal degeneration. Specific Aim 1 (SA1) initially defines whether
interneuron progenitor cell supplementation via heterochronic grafts into mutant neonatal pups favorably
modifies the occurrence of motor deficits and striatal degeneration, two distinctive traits of HD. This aim also
examines whether the role of interneurons in disease progression takes place at the expense of quantitative
deficits or through additional factors associated with expression of mutant huntingtin in these cells. SA2
interrogates the interneuron-dependent pathogenic mechanisms mediating HD, focusing on putative modulatory
effects of GABA, Reelin and complementary ligand release. Finally, SA3 employs a large array of HD
postmortem specimens from two major brain banks to define the role in disease progression of cortical
interneuron deficits. This aim also interrogates whether known HD genetic modifiers, including trinucleotide
expansion length and/or polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes modulate the extent of interneuron
alterations, as well as whether these cells mediate the predictive effects of these genetic modifiers on age at
disease onset/progression. Overall, confirmation of the central hypothesis would have substantial implications
for the field, as it will provide strong evidence regarding the intersectional roles of interneurons in HD
pathogenesis and also define a novel early-stage therapeutic window for preventing HD onset and progression
for a neurodegenerative disorder currently lacking substantive and effective therapeutic interventions."

Astrocytes have been shown to play an important role in synaptic transmission. While there is emerging
research about the effects of neurotransmitters on astrocytes, there is little known about how other signaling
molecules such as hormones impact astrocyte signaling. One important hormone that is well studied with
neuronal signaling is estradiol (E2). This has important relevance in motivated behaviors such as drug
addiction where astrocyte signaling and estrogen signaling affect drug seeking behavior. However, it is
unknown how estrogen specifically affects astrocyte signaling. This proposal will determine how estrogen
affects astrocyte signaling and its subsequent regulation of tripartite synaptic transmission. For this proposal, I
will focus on astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as this brain region is critical for drug seeking
behaviors and displays structural and functional sex differences. I hypothesize that E2 will increase intracellular
calcium in astrocytes by binding to estrogen receptors on astrocytes. This receptor binding will lead to
gliotransmitter release which will in turn increase excitatory synaptic transmission. To this test hypothesis, I will
use two photon microscopy to examine calcium activity in astrocytes. I will first establish that E2 increases
calcium activity in NAc astrocytes (Aim 1a). I will then determine the location and ER subtype as well as cell
type in which ER is expressed (Aim 1b). For Aim 2, I will test the effects of E2 on excitatory synaptic
transmission. First, I will determine where E2 stimulates gliotransmitter release by measuring slow inward
currents, a biological assay of astrocytic glutamate release (Aim 2a). In addition, I will monitor excitatory post
synaptic currents (EPSCs) and determine the gliotransmitter responsible for changes in EPSCs (Aim 2b). This
proposal will fill the knowledge gap of how estrogen affects astrocyte signaling which could lead to further
understanding of sex differences in NAc related behaviors. This proposal will also allow me to master many
research techniques such as two photon calcium imaging as well as electrophysiology, which will promote my
career goals to become an independent academic neuroscience researcher."

Cellular senescence, characterized by stable proliferation arrest and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors,
is not only a hallmark of aging, but also a key contributor to age-associated diseases in humans. As the US
population is aging, there is an added urgency to gain a better understanding of cellular senescence in
different tissues over the lifespan. Unfortunately, we still lack the knowledge to unambiguously define
senescence at the molecular and cellular levels, due to its heterogeneous phenotypes. To address this major
gap in knowledge, we propose to establish a tissue mapping center that focuses on the identification and
characterization of senescent cells in healthy male and female mouse brain, bone marrow, breast, colon and
liver. Our research strategy builds on recent advances in single cell epigenomics technologies that our team
developed and the knowledge that senescent cells exhibit characteristic changes in the chromatin
landscapes, histone modifications and expression of marker genes of cellular senescence. We will deploy
cutting-edge single cell in situ and tissue dissociative multi-omic tools that have been well established in our
center to produce comprehensive single cell resolution maps of the transcriptome and epigenome in male
and female mouse brain, bone marrow, breast, colon and liver, and to provide qualitative and quantitative
spatial maps of the normal burden of senescent cells in these vital organs, across the lifespan of two mouse
strains. We will rigorously validate the newly defined senescent cell populations using pharmacologic and
genetic approaches to eradicate senescent cells or suppress their inflammatory phenotype, and orthogonal
state-of-the-art and conventional assays for cellular senescence. We will generate whole genome single cell
DNA methylation data to link our spatial atlas to measurement of epigenetic age, a candidate predictor of
beneficial versus detrimental effects of senescent cells. We expect that comprehensive single cell atlases of
epigenome and transcriptome will enable us to identify and characterize cellular senescence in different
tissue contexts and during aging.
We expect that the planned research will provide a reference for future
studies that seek to characterize and target senescent cells associated with or preceding disease in
brain,
bone marrow, breast, colon and liver."
10889161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Data Analysis Core will computationally define and characterize transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures
of cellular senescence in murine brain, bone marrow, colon, breast and liver cell types from healthy male and
female young and old mice. We will use established, scalable pipelines to process data generated by the
Biological Analysis Core and create an integrated map of brain, bone marrow, colon, breast and liver cell types
using cellular profiles derived from all single cell sequencing and imaging assays together. Using this integrated
map, we will identify populations of senescent cells within each tissue-resident cell type based on gene
expression and epigenomic profiles of known cellular senescence markers, and define both heterogeneous sub-
types of senescent cells as well as ‘senescent-like’ cells with non-canonical profiles. For each senescent and
senescent-like sub-type, we will define its cis-regulatory programs including candidate cis-regulatory elements
(cCREs), chromatin states, transcriptional regulators and target genes of cCRE activity (i.e., gene enhancer –
promoter networks), as well as their spatial orientation and micro-environment. We will characterize changes in
the abundance and cis-regulation of senescent and senescent-like cell sub-types as well as cell types in the
senescent niche across life span and linked to sex, cell type and tissue region. This integrated transcriptomic
and epigenomic map of senescent cells will define and resolve senescent cells better than transcriptome alone.
We will evaluate the effects of genetic and pharmacologic clearance of senescent cells and anti-inflammatory
senomorphics. We will establish a pipeline to determine epigenetic age of single senescent cells based on their
DNA methylation profile, a candidate predictor of beneficial versus detrimental senescent cells. Throughout the
project we will work closely with the UCSD Center for Epigenomics and the Biological Analysis Core of this
project to track data quality, link study design to downstream analyses by incorporating batch and other technical
covariates, inform selection of targets for validation studies, and organize meta-data and associated data for all
experiments. Finally, we will create a meta-data repository based on open-source software employed by our
group in other large-scale projects to organize all raw and processed data, provide integrated results files,
processing pipelines and analytical tools used by the project, and ensure all project data is FAIR, interoperable
and adheres to community standard formats. Using this repository, we will transfer project data to the Consortium
Organization and Data Coordination Center (CODCC) and collaborate with other groups in the consortium to
share data and resources."

10889237,"SUMMARY
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) remains the only validated molecular target in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), mediating cell survival signaling and resistance to radiation therapy.
despite the success of EGFR targeted therapies such as cetuximab, therapeutic resistance to EGFR targeting
ultimately develops. A significant challenge for improving EGFR targeted therapies is to identify and clinically
validate actionable mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. In this proposal, we have designed a strategy that
iterates between basic science investigations, preclinical testing, and clinical specimen testing to elucidate the
mechanism of cetuximab resistance in HNSCC. Using an in vitro approach for analyzing cetuximab resistance,
we identified upregulation of a targetable autocrine ligand, NRG-1, as a target mechanism of resistance. We
have modeled this resistance both in cell lines and in vivo, using mouse xenograft studies, and have shown
that it can be reversed therapeutically by using an ErbB3-targeted antibody therapeutic (CDX-3379) – which
can restore responses to cetuximab and radiation therapy. We have also observed NRG-1-induced resistance
to small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors in cancer cells, and have studied the mechanistic origin of this
resistance at a structural level. We propose to exploit this new knowledge to advance small molecular
approaches for targeting EGFR family members in HNSCC. In parallel with these studies, we will study clinical
specimens from an ongoing phase II HNSCC trial of afatinib plus cetuximab, plus two ECOG trials of
cetuximab, to investigate resistance mechanisms in the clinic. We will also develop patient-derived xenografts
(PDX) models from the ongoing clinical trial to test hypotheses for resistance mechanisms and to assess
effectiveness of new strategies devised to overcome it.
 The key premise of the proposal is that understanding mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab will open up
new therapeutic opportunities – allowing us to develop approaches that can still inhibit EGFR when cetuximab
fails, and to develop approaches to target other molecules that activate EGFR in a cetuximab-insensitive way
(such as ErbB3). Our three Specific Aims are:
1. To elucidate and model mechanisms of cetuximab resistance in HNSCC, and to test CDX-3379 as a new
 ErbB3 targeted approach for enhancing systemic and/or radiation therapy in HNSCC.
2. To develop new structure/mechanism-guided strategies for successful ErbB-receptor targeting with small
 molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in HNSCC.
3. To identify biomarkers of therapeutic response to ErbB-targeted therapies using clinical trial samples, and to
 establish parallel patient-derived tumor models to evaluate mechanisms of resistance to ErbB-targeted
 therapies in HNSCC."
10889238,"Summary
HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) typically lose G1/S cell cycle checkpoints,
with most tumors having mutations in TP53, and many also mutating other tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A.
Such tumors become dependent on checkpoints associated with G2/M to repair DNA damage arising from
replication stress and other genomic insults. This dependency suggests a tumor-selective vulnerability to
synthetic lethal strategies controlling progress through G2/M. In extensive preliminary data, we show that
AZD1775/adavosertib, an inhibitor of the G2/M checkpoint kinase WEE1, potently sensitizes TP53mut HNSCC
cell lines to inhibition of Aurora A kinase (AURKA). WEE1 induces an inhibitory Y15-phosphorylation of CDK1,
blocking M-phase entry and thus blunting the cytotoxic effects AURKA inhibition. WEE1 inhibition abrogates this
arrest, accelerating mitotic entry for cells bearing highly disruptive spindle abnormalities and other defects arising
from AURKA inhibition, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. We found combined AURKA/WEE1
inhibition is potent in HNSCC xenografts, while well-tolerated in normal tissue and cells. We have extended this
concept, identifying additional promising drug combinations between WEE1 and other G2/M regulatory kinases
(PLK1 and CHK1). Notably, the limited number of cells surviving synthetic lethal treatment are characterized by
aneuploidy and other defects suggesting they may have increased tumor mutation burden (TMB), express
neoantigens, and upregulated inflammatory signaling associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition.
This project will take this observation directly to the clinic. We will conduct a pre-operative window phase I and
expansion clinical trial of the late generation, high potency selective AURKA inhibitor LY3295668 with
adavosertib combination, establishing pharmacodynamic proof of concept, identifying biomarkers for patient
selection in future studies, and placing synergistic combinations in context of genomic alteration and treatment
resistance. In Aim 1, we will evaluate mechanisms of combination lethality, and use single cell sequencing and
Luminex profiling to query TMB, predict neoantigens, and measure inflammatory signaling. Aim 2 will query the
effect of classes of common HNSCC TP53 and CDKN2A mutations, and cisplatin resistance, on response to a
WEE1-AURKA inhibitor combination, using defined cell line models and patient derived xenografts (PDXs). In
Aim 3, we will perform a pre-operative window trial to establish recommended phase 2 doses, determine activity
and establish pharmacodynamic proof of concept, and to evaluate putative predictive biomarkers for response
to combination WEE1/AURKA inhibition in HNSCC."
10889241,"SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents an increasing
proportion of HNSCC. The incidence of HPV+ HNSCC has dramatically increased over the last 2 decades and
in 2012 surpassed uterine cervical cancer as the most common HPV-related malignancy in the U.S. Despite
the HPV vaccine, it is estimated that the “epidemic” of HNSCC caused by HPV will not diminish until 2060.
HPV+ HNSCCs occur in younger individuals and prognosis for patients with these tumors is better compared
to patients with classical HNSCC; however, ~25% of patients recur with few effective therapeutic options.
Based on observed hypermethylation of HPV+ HNSCC from TCGA, and understanding that HPV uses
hypermethylation to impede the innate immune response, effects of the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-
azaC), were tested on HPV+ HNSCC. We found that HPV+ HNSCC cells in culture and xenografts are
sensitive to 5-azaC, and that 5-azaC caused double strand breaks (DSB) that were not observed after 5-azaC
therapy in HPV-negative HNSCC, even with much higher doses. We found that following 5-azaC therapy,
APOlipoprotein B mRNA-Editing enzyme Catalytic polypeptide 3B (APOBEC3B) was associated with
chromatin in HPV+ HNSCC, but not HPV-negative cells. CRISPR knockdown of A3B prevented DSB and
protected cells from 5-azaC-induced death. Despite being required for DSBs and cellular toxicity caused by 5-
azaC, A3B was also required for clonogenic survival of untreated HPV+ HNSCC. These data showing that A3B
is required for survival of HPV+ HNSCC cells, but that following demethylation A3B mediates toxicity and DSB.
In addition, 5-azaC therapy increased type I interferon signaling as measured by increased expression of
interferon-stimulated genes. These exciting pre-clinical data led to a window trial of 5days of 5-azaC. Analysis
of tumor specimens confirmed in vitro data showing that 5-azaC resulted in cellular toxicity. Immunofluorescent
staining of an HPV+ patient tumors pre- and post-5-azaC showed a marked increase in tumor-associated
lymphocytes, possibly driven through activation of type I interferon combined with increased expression of
neoantigens. In this YHN-SPORE project, we hypothesize 5-azaC therapy will enhance response to nivolumab
(Nivo) through its ability to cause cell death, increase neoantigen expression, increase A3B-driven mutational
load, and enhance T cell infiltration through increased type I interferon signaling. These hypotheses will be
tested using established and novel in vitro assays, as well as through examination of pre- and post-therapy
tumor specimens from a 3-armed clinical trial. In Aim 1, tumor specimens from the SPORE window trial will be
analyzed to determine effects of 5-azaC, Nivo, or the combination on cell death, cell proliferation, immune
infiltration and immune activation. Aim 2 will employ standard and novel assays to explore the role of A3B in
cellular toxicity exposed by 5-azaC therapy. In Aim 3, we will determine effects of 5-azaC on activators of
immune recognition and response in the presence or absence of Nivo."

 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes causing vision loss. Diabetes-
induced metabolic abnormality and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative stress is a primary
pathogenic factor driving DR onset and development. This proposal will complete the two Aims: (1) To
elucidate how placental growth factor (PlGF) mediates DR-related pathology by suppressing glucose 6
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) flux. (2) To
determine the protective role of G6PD’s antioxidant function via oxPPP in retinal cells against diabetes-
induced oxidative injury. More specifically, the PlGF signaling pathway molecules involved in regulating
G6PD expression and activity will be uncovered. The new mechanisms by which PlGF mediates diabetes-
induced retinal endothelial cell barrier dysfunction and other DR-related pathologies through the metabolic
shift from PPP to glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction will be elucidated in cell cultures and murine
models. G6PD’s protective role in DR will be determined using cell-/tissue-specific G6PD conditional
knockout (cKO) and conditional overexpression (cOE) mice, as well as AAV-based G6PD expression
vector and small-molecule G6PD activator. Overall, the research is designed to elucidate the regulation
and role of the “diabetes-PlGF-G6PD-oxidative stress” signaling cascades in DR pathogenesis. The
outcomes will give mechanistic insight into DR pathogenesis in general and PlGF function in particular.
Since that PlGF has emerged as a promising target molecule to treat DR and diabetic macular edema
(DEM), understanding the underlying mechanism is significant. Given the central role of G6PD-gated
oxPPP in regulating redox homeostasis and cell survival under stress conditions, this project will fill a
critical knowledge gap regarding whether G6PD’s antioxidant function via oxPPP plays a pivotal role in
protecting retinal cells from diabetes-induced oxidative damage and compromised G6PD activity and
limited oxPPP flux contribute to DR pathogenesis. To examine metabolic flux and mitochondrial function,
quantitative measurements will be applied, including stable labeling tracer [1,2-13C2]glucose, liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry, targeted metabolomics, oxygen consumption rate/extracellular
acidification rate. Cutting-edge approaches will be employed to determine G6PD’s protective effect, such
as gene silence (shRNA), genetic models (cKO and cOE mouse), CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, virus-
based gene transfer, and pharmaceutical compounds. In summary, this project is innovative because it
will elucidate a novel mechanism for PlGF to mediate DR-related pathology by regulating glucose
metabolism and provide new insights into the question(s) “why or how are retinal cells become vulnerable
to diabetes-induced oxidative stress?”. It will also explore the new approaches to prevent or delay DR and
DME development by enhancing antioxidant capacity."

Nanoscale drug carriers (i.e. nanocarriers) have attracted much attention for their ability to transport diverse
therapeutic and diagnostic agents and to selectively target specific cells and tissues. This increased specificity
can have significant clinical implications, including decreased side effects and lower dosages with higher
potency. Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells hold promise as a cellular target for glaucoma therapy, as their
mechanical stiffness is associated with modulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Rho kinase inhibitors and actin-
depolymerizing agents reduce endothelial cell stiffness and significantly lower IOP in animals and humans with
several now approved for clinical use. However, these agents are associated with significant side effects,
including conjunctival hyperemia and corneal verticillata. Studies show that >50% of patients treated with these
therapeutics exhibit adverse side effects. Targeted nanocarrier delivery systems may address these issues but
are not currently capable of passing through the corneal epithelium and must therefore be administered via
intraocular injection. As frequent eye injections would not be well tolerated by patients, sustained intraocular
delivery systems are needed to minimize the frequency of drug administration. Gene therapy targets for
treatment of ocular hypotension have emerged, holding promise for a future glaucoma cure following a single
intraocular injection, but a targeted gene delivery system is needed to enhance selective transfection of SC cells.
A significant need therefore exists for both sustained nanocarrier delivery systems and gene delivery systems
for intraocular strategies targeting the SC. With these needs in mind, the objective of this proposal is to engineer
a scalable, customizable, synthetic nanocarrier platform that can be adapted to transport diverse therapeutic
agents to outflow pathway cells with controllable release rates. Successful completion of this work will result in
the first delivery system for sustained intraocular release of nanocarriers, a novel nonviral gene delivery platform
for selective transfection of SC cells, and completion of nonhuman primate studies to justify clinical trials of these
delivery systems in humans.
The following Specific Aims will be completed:
Aim 1: Optimize the duration of therapeutic effect for nanocarriers targeting Schlemm’s canal cells while avoiding
side effects and toxicity within the cornea and vascular tissues in mouse eyes.
Aim 2: Demonstrate nonviral transfection of Schlemm's canal cells in vivo using targeted nanocarriers without
affecting nearby ocular tissues in mice
Aim 3: Demonstrate that targeted nanocarriers containing latrunculin-A significantly increase conventional
outflow facility and lower IOP in nonhuman primates without adverse effects."

Migraine is the world's second leading cause of disability; half of the 45 million Americans with migraine require
bedrest for relief. Migraine affects overall health, relationships, careers, and financial stability. Disability is a
patient-centered outcome that captures the full impact of disease on patients' lives. Migraine medications are
limited by side effects, lack of efficacy, and costs. Despite recommendations against opioid use due to risks of
medication overuse headache and addiction, a third of Americans with migraine turn to opioids for acute relief.
There is an unmet need for more effective migraine therapies that target disability with long-term efficacy,
safety, and tolerability. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can help migraine as it targets stress, the
top migraine trigger. Mindfulness may change the pain experience through brain mechanisms associated with
nociceptive processing, cognitive function, and emotional regulation. We have shown mindfulness has
statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits on disability, pain catastrophizing, depression, and
self-efficacy in patients with migraine. Interceptive awareness and headache frequency also improved. Our
prior research utilized designs with high methodological rigor (e.g., RCT) but were modest in size with
homogenous samples of participants able to engage with in-person classes that limited generalizability. Such
limitations may be offset by flexible online options. Patients with migraine are interested in electronic (e)Health
options, yet few evidenced-based options exist. This proposal addresses these gaps with a large study using
national recruitment and an online, accessible intervention that was developed to deliver key mindfulness
principles to diverse populations. We plan to test the efficacy of online MBSR vs. online HA education in adults
with migraine in a phase 3 RCT. The main goal will be evaluation of efficacy (Aim 1), with secondary goals of
understanding mechanisms (Aim 2) and gathering data (Aim 3) for a future, scalable implementation study. As
done previously, interventions will be matched on time/attention and participants will continue all current
migraine medications, as we have shown medication plus behavioral treatments have the greatest impact. This
fully remotely delivered study will determine the efficacy of online MBSR in adults with migraine to target the
urgent need for better migraine treatments on the patient-centered outcome of migraine disability. We are
using an eHealth delivery format that increases access and availability to diverse populations compared to in-
person weekly classes. Mind-body treatments can be leveraged to advance health equity and we will do so
through a variety of strategies. If effective, this research will lead to an implementation trial so that ultimately,
patients with migraine of diverse backgrounds will have an easily accessible, standardized, non-drug, non-
opioid treatment that could be used worldwide to target the highly prevalent disease of migraine and its
associated disability."

The rise of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in U.S. youth is an alarming public health issue. Although obesity is a strong
risk factor for pediatric T2D, at the same time, only a subset of youth with obesity develops T2D, suggesting
disease pathogenesis is driven by factors beyond total adiposity. It is well-established that altered body fat
trafficking into abdominal and hepatic fats is strongly correlated with metabolic dysfunction in youth, independent
of obesity. Recently, pancreatic traits assessed by imaging, particularly pancreatic fat and volume, have also
emerged as potential risk factors for dysglycemia in youth. However, research examining the metabolic effects
of these traits in youth has been limited to smaller cross-sectional studies, primarily conducted in clinical
populations (i.e., children with existing obesity, fatty liver, or dysglycemia). Also, few, if any, human studies have
explored the influence of the early nutritional environment on these pancreatic traits. In the proposed K99/R00
award, we will address these knowledge gaps by leveraging data from the Healthy Start Study, a longitudinal,
pre-birth, cohort study in Colorado that has comprehensively characterized ~1,400 mother-child pairs since
pregnancy. The applicant, Dr. Catherine Cohen, PhD, RDN, will add quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) sequences to scans performed at the next wave of visits when offspring are in adolescence (10-15 years)
to measure pancreatic fat and volume. This data will then be used to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1.
Assess pancreatic fat and volume in a general risk cohort of adolescents and examine interindividual variation
in relation to child characteristics and adiposity measures (K99). Aim 2. Test prospective associations of early
nutrition/growth with pancreatic fat and volume in adolescence (K99/R00). Aim 3. Examine associations of
pancreatic fat and volume trajectories across adolescence with trajectories of glucose-insulin markers across
adolescence, and the role of pancreatic traits in mediating associations of early nutrition and growth with glycemic
markers (R00).Taken together, the findings of this proposal will improve knowledge of the role of pancreatic traits
as risk markers for early onset dysglycemia during puberty and generate insights that will enhance our ability to
design and target T2D prevention strategies more effectively. The proposed training goals for the K99 phase will
complement this research and focus on gaining: (1) experience applying lifecourse epidemiology concepts, (2)
expertise in assessing body composition, especially adiposity measures, and (3) knowledge of pediatric T2D
pathophysiology and dynamic glucose-insulin assessments, and will be achieved through individual mentorship,
practical experiences, and didactic training, and supplemented with opportunities to expand professional
development skills. Collectively, the proposed research and training activities will strategically equip the applicant
with the knowledge/skills needed to transition from mentored (K99) phase to independent (R00) phase."

Implantable neuroelectronic interfaces for recording and modulating brain activity can treat drug-resistant
neurological diseases; however, traditional electrode implantation requires invasive open-skull surgery and
poses considerable risks, such as intracortical bleeding and infection, and inevitably damages the brain.
To address these issues, this proposal aims to create a platform for endovascular delivery of chronically-
stable probes for robust recording and modulation of neural activity. In related work, Dr. Anqi Zhang has
demonstrated the feasibility of endovascular implantation and recording by developing flexible neural
probes that can be delivered into sub-100-micron cortical vessels to acutely record local field potentials
and single-unit activity in anesthetized rats. In this proposal, the capabilities of the endovascular probes
will be expanded by first achieving controllable implantation into both superficial and deep cortical vessels
adjacent to common therapeutic targets, followed by systematic studies and characterizations of endovas-
cular recording and stimulation, with a focus on single-unit activity in anesthetized rats, and finally manu-
facturing stretchable endovascular probes for long-term implantation and recording in awake, behaving
rats. This proposal is significant because it will develop a platform technology that can be readily extended
to the detection and treatment of other chronic and progressive neurological diseases, and serves as the
foundation for the clinical translation of minimally invasive neuroelectronic interfaces to neurology, neuro-
surgery, and interventional radiology practice. Dr. Zhang has suitable prior training in chemistry, materials
science, neuroscience, and bioelectronics, and has extensive experience in mentoring and teaching. Dur-
ing the K99 phase of this proposal, Dr. Zhang will be mentored by an experienced team of experts in neu-
rological diseases, cerebrovascular surgery, optogenetics and calcium imaging, in vivo electrophysiology,
and design and fabrication of stretchable devices. Stanford University also provides substantial resources
and support for her professional training. Dr. Zhang’s advisory team will oversee her research progress
and professional development through training in new techniques, clinical translation, job seeking and ne-
gotiation, scientific writing and communication, mentoring, and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
Upon completion of this mentored research project, Dr. Zhang will acquire the knowledge and skills neces-
sary to use her strengths in physical sciences and engineering to develop minimally invasive chronic neu-
ral interfaces, and the professional skills that will be extremely beneficial for her transition to become an
independent investigator."

Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world today. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimates that there are over 142 million people at risk of irreversible loss of sight. This
figure likely underestimates the true numbers as it is difficult to account for all communities that are affected
globally. The ocular disease caused by Ct is called trachoma and carries an annual price tag of approximately
$8 billion from lost productivity. The highest concentrations of this neglected disease include 37 countries in
Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America along with Australia. Africa has over 89% of the
world’s known trachoma cases, reflecting a major region of health disparity. The WHO developed the SAFE
strategy to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by the year 2020. SAFE stands for: Surgery to correct
in-turned eyelashes (known as Trachomatous Trichiasis or TT); Antibiotics to treat Ct; Facial cleanliness to
improve hygiene, and Environmental improvements to reduce transmission. The A part of SAFE includes Mass
Drug Administration (MDA) with azithromycin and has been used in many countries. Ten endemic or
hypoendemic countries have been validated by WHO as being trachoma free. However, 6 endemic and 38
hyperendemic countries have not, although they have received 5 to over 10 rounds of MDA. The highest burden
of disease is in Ethiopia and South Sudan where ~30-50% of children under 10 years of age have active
trachoma, and the reasons for this remain unclear. Trachoma as a public health concern will not be eliminated
until we understand why there is ongoing active trachoma following multiple rounds of MDA in hyperendemic
countries. Our unifying hypothesis, therefore, is that the natural history of trachoma is defined by the interaction
of the ocular microbiome, immune responses and pathogen populations (both Ct and non-Ct) that are influenced
by MDA. While there is a growing body of research on the ocular microbiome, few studies have evaluated
differences in microbiota composition between healthy and trachomatous eyes and none have looked at the
influence of Ct infection. We will employ metagenome shotgun sequencing (MSS) to understand healthy,
dysbiotic and chlamydial-associated microbiota in addition to immune responses and pathogen genomic
characteristics for a cohort residing in the trachoma hyperendemic Amhara Region of Ethiopia. We aim to: 1)
Examine Ct infections based on whole genome sequencing; 2) Identify taxonomic diversity and abundance of
ocular microbiota among subjects with and without Chlamydia and their association with trachomatous disease;
and 3) Determine host microbiota/immune response profiles associated with and without Chlamydia, and
develop models to predict trachoma post MDA. This work will naturally transition to improving chlamydial
diagnostics that utilize MSS methods, and developing interventions that, given the ineffective antibiotic regimens
to date, may include novel therapeutic strategies and/or revised treatment duration to decrease and eliminate
hyperendemic trachoma among at risk populations in Africa that have the greatest need for intervention."

Malaria continues to be a major scourge of humanity, and is caused by infection of red blood cells (RBCs) by
the protozoan Plasmodium spp. parasites. Plasmodium falciparum can achieve high parasite biomasses in the
circulation causing severe morbidity and mortality. Blood-stage parasites have a strict cellular tropism for RBCs,
interacting with numerous molecular determinants in the RBCs for productive infection and transmission.
Parasite polymorphisms that allow parasites to propagate and persist in different types of RBCs present a major
challenge to malaria control and elimination. This includes the ability of the invasive merozoite forms to use
different receptors on RBCs, known as invasion pathways. We will leverage the power of forward genetics to
identify the molecular determinants mediating two key features of the cellular tropism of P. falciparum: RBC age
and RBC species preference. We have found that different P. falciparum strains vary significantly in these
preferences, and hypothesize that the parasite polymorphisms underlying this variation are critical to the
emergence and persistence of P. falciparum in human populations, and are key determinants of pathogenesis
and transmission. We will employ a forward genetics approach to identify polymorphisms and genes associated
with RBC age and species preference, specifically Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA) of progeny from genetic
crosses of P. falciparum parental lines with varying invasion preferences. Reverse genetics approaches will be
used for the functional analysis of naturally occurring polymorphisms in candidate genes, both singly and in
combination. Together these studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of
cellular tropism in P. falciparum parasites, focused on RBC age and species preference. In the long-term we
hope that our studies will elucidate the critical interactions required for the persistence, pathogenicity and
transmission of P. falciparum in parasite populations, to inform public health interventions and inform vaccine
development."

 low-income adolescents
PROJECT SUMMARY
Physical inactivity is a public health crisis in the United States (U.S.), with less than a quarter (24%) of children
and adolescents and only 3 out of every 4 adults (75%) meeting physical activity guidelines. Historical
disinvestments and institutional bias have led to suboptimal access to safe and efficient active transportation
options, and to safe, quality places for active play, recreation, and sport in high-need communities, resulting in
significant economic and racial/ethnic physical activity disparities. Early adolescence is a critical window of
opportunity for establishing lifelong physically active lifestyles and is the stage of life when the steepest
declines in physical activity occur. Given that schools can serve as hubs for community and civic engagement,
school communities are excellent settings for community-engaged physical activity interventions involving and
prioritizing students, parents, and school neighborhood residents at large. To date, however, most school-
based physical activity interventions have focused on elementary schools, and on physical education, active
recess, and after-school sports programs (i.e., the leisure domain), with less emphasis on active transportation
promotion, despite the relatively high independent mobility of middle school students. Further, most
environmental strategies to promote physical activity do not include in-depth community-engagement methods,
although these approaches can help optimize their contextual responsiveness, effectiveness, and
sustainability; and align with the principles of health equity and social justice. We propose a 2-phase, rigorous
mixed methods study to identify community-level barriers and facilitators for active transport and leisure
physical activity (Phase 1); and to co-create and test the effectiveness and longer-term sustainability of
community-based physical activity intervention strategies (Phase 2) in urban, low-income, minoritized middle
school catchment areas. Our team includes researchers and community-based partners with expertise in
participatory research and extensive knowledge and connections with local communities. Our aims are (1) to
identify community-level barriers and facilitators for physical activity in low-income, urban middle school
communities with high proportions of minoritized residents, using a comprehensive mixed methods approach
(a blended Delphi survey plus Group Concept Mapping method, and quantitative plus qualitative/participatory
GIS methods); (2) to equitably engage multi-sectoral and multi-generational community actors for co-creating
(co-design, co-implementation and co-evaluation) contextually-responsive intervention strategies to improve
equity in access to active transport and leisure in low-income, urban middle school communities with high
proportions of minoritized residents; and (3) to conduct a first-generation, controlled trial testing the
effectiveness of the co-created intervention strategies for improving physical activity outcomes in low-income,
predominantly-minoritized urban middle school communities. If successful, these community-based strategies
can be scaled-up to help reduce physical inactivity and noncommunicable disease disparities in the U.S."
10886593,"PROJECT SUMMARY
After the chromosomes are segregated by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle, cytokinesis completes cell
division, partitioning the contents of the mother cell to the two daughter cells. Cytokinesis is accomplished by
constriction of an acto-myosin contractile ring that forms on the cortex in an equatorial band encircling the cell
equator. Cytokinesis failure generates tetraploid cells that are a common intermediate in the genesis of cancers.
Upregulation and mutation of cytokinesis regulators has also been implicated in different cancers, and inhibitors
targeting cytokinesis are of interest as potential chemotherapeutic agents, motivating efforts to understand the
mechanisms that pattern cortical contractility during cytokinesis. To ensure that each daughter cell receives an
equivalent genomic complement, the position of the contractile ring is specified by the anaphase spindle. The
spindle sends two superimposed signals to the cortex: (1) a positive signal promoting contractile ring assembly
that is generated by set of bundled microtubules, called the central spindle, that forms between the separating
chromosomes, and (2) a negative signal generated by the microtubule asters that suppresses the contractility of
the non-equatorial cortex. The proposed work focuses on the molecular basis for these two signals that
collectively direct contractile ring assembly. A central component of the positive signal promoting contractile ring
assembly is centralspindlin, a tetrameric complex formed by a dimer of kinesin-6 and a dimer of CYK4.
Centralspindlin is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which concentrates on the central spindle; it
subsequently diffuses to the adjacent plasma membrane where, through mechanisms that remain largely
unclear, its CYK4 subunit engages with and activates the ECT2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF).
Active ECT2 in turn generates an equatorial zone enriched for the master regulator of contractile ring assembly,
RhoA-GTP. In Aim 1, we address the major open question with respect to positive cytokinesis signaling: the
mechanism of ECT2 activation by centralspindlin. To understand how the microtubule asters suppress
contractility on the non-equatorial cortex, which occurs at the same time as positive signaling from the central
spindle, we developed an assay monitoring clearing of contractile ring proteins from the cell poles in the C.
elegans embryo. Using this assay, we identified Aurora A kinase as an essential mediator of aster-based
contractility suppression. In Aim 2, we build on this work to identify the Aurora A targets that mediate contractility
suppression and extend analysis of this mechanism to human cells. Aim 3 addresses an important gap in
understanding how the cell cycle state that supports contractile ring assembly is generated, and assesses
whether the duration of cytokinesis, like that of mitosis, is monitored by a p53-based mitotic stopwatch
mechanism that eliminates potentially problematic cells from the population."
10886594,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than 500,000 patients acquire Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) each year, making them the leading cause
of hospital-acquired infections. SSIs account for billions of dollars in added health care costs and are
associated with up to 11 times higher risk of post-surgical mortality. Despite near universal adherence to
Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) guidelines for prophylactic antibiotic administration, SSI rates
remain stagnant. As compared to SCIP, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) provides far more
comprehensive guidelines for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Beyond the SCIP measures, which focus mostly
on antibiotic timing with respect to surgical incision, IDSA guidelines additionally include: 1) more specific
antibiotic selection for several surgical procedures, 2) weight-adjusted antibiotic dosing, and 3) timely antibiotic
re-dosing during prolonged surgeries. Each of these is a crucial aspect of antibiotic administration and is not
addressed by SCIP guidelines that inform the majority of perioperative antibiotic practice. In preliminary work
using a national dataset, we found that non-adherence to at least one of the components of IDSA guidelines
occurred in over one-third of surgical cases. We also found that IDSA non-adherence is markedly higher during
unplanned scenarios such as surgeries involving multiple blood product transfusions and emergency surgeries
indicating there may be a situational component to the non-adherence. We believe promoting adherence to
IDSA guidelines can markedly reduce SSIs and can be achieved by targeting healthcare provider workflow
barriers and knowledge deficits using a provider centered clinical decision support (CDS) tool. We propose to -
Aim 1: Measure the association of nonadherence to IDSA guidelines and its components (antibiotic choice,
timing, dosing, and intraoperative redosing) with SSI occurrence by analyzing merged data from two robust
national registries: the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), which captures detailed
postoperative outcomes, with the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) that captures detailed
perioperative data. Additionally, we will examine differences in nonadherence (disparities in care) across
several AHRQ priority groups to identify opportunities for SSI reduction within these subgroups. Aim 2: Identify
factors associated with deviation from IDSA guidelines in practice through semi structured interviews of
perioperative healthcare providers and incorporate these to develop a CDS tool that promotes IDSA adherent
antibiotic practices. Aim 3: Assess the real-world performance of the CDS tool and provider feedback using
the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework of implementation
evaluation. Public Health Significance: SSIs are common, costly, and largely avoidable. The proposed study
will a) help determine relationships between IDSA guideline nonadherence and SSIs including among AHRQ
priority groups; b) identify barriers to guideline adherence; and c) test a readily usable intervention for
implementation in a future large pragmatic trial powered to detect reduction in SSI outcomes."
10886611,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In individuals with a unilateral leg amputation, protecting the health of intact anatomy is critical for minimizing
secondary comorbidities (e.g., residual leg pain, secondary amputation) that compromise their quality of life. An
important indicator of soft tissue health is skin temperature. Tissues exposed to high temperatures can be a
source of discomfort and increase risks for pressure sores or ulcer formation, specifically in vulnerable sites such
as the intact foot and residuum tissue at the socket interface. Temperature regulation is especially problematic
for prosthesis users with diabetes (i.e., the most common cause of amputation in the US) who have impaired
vascular function to dissipate heat. There is currently limited knowledge of the mechanisms driving abnormal
temperature of affected areas (intact foot, residuum tissue), with or without the influence of diabetes, which
hinders early diagnosis of soft tissue complications and interventions aimed to mitigate risks. Recent studies in
healthy adults and individuals with diabetes but without an amputation suggest that foot temperature responses
are correlated to mechanical factors (e.g., shear forces and work) during walking. Similar studies on unilateral
prosthesis users will reveal if the intact foot has elevated risks for tissue complications, especially given their
tendency to rely more on the intact leg for daily walking tasks. However, it is currently unknown whether the
same mechanical-thermal relationship applies to the residuum tissue within the prosthetic socket, which must
assume load-bearing functions similar to the feet. Furthermore, it is unknown how poor vascular function due to
diabetes exacerbates thermal regulation in high-risk areas (e.g., intact foot and residuum tissue) in prosthesis
users. This proposal will strive towards a unified understanding of the mechanisms underlying thermal regulation
in individuals with a leg amputation, including mechanical (Aim 1) and vascular physiology (Aim 2) factors. As a
translational benchmark, Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of a modular prosthetic shock-absorbing
component, previously shown to reduce forces and work on the residual and intact legs, to reduce risks for tissue
complications that arise due to impaired temperature regulation."
10886706,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ability to seek out situations that elicit pleasure and avoid those that lead to aversion or discomfort is a
fundamental ability we all share, yet dysfunctional hedonic processing is prevalent in numerous psychiatric
illnesses including substance use disorders (SUDs), alcohol abuse, and depression. As such, it is critical to
understand the basic neural mechanisms underlying aversive affective states to ultimately apply treatment
strategies to restore normal hedonic processing and aid in the recovery of maladaptive behaviors in mental
illness. Here, we seek to understand the role of ‘top-down’ medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus
accumbens (NAc) processing of innate and conditioned negative affective processing, incorporating
electrophysiology, optogenetics, and a rat transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) method we
developed. We focus on one type of behavior (taste reactivity, TR), measured in innate (unconditioned) situations
and during conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and its extinction (restoration of positive affect). Notably, TR has
exceptional translational value since it is preserved across species with similar behaviors present in rats,
nonhuman primates and humans. Using electrophysiology, we will first determine how oscillatory, coordinated
rhythms in mPFC and NAc circuitry are linked to affective processing in real time in the naïve state, how this
signaling shifts when the sweet becomes devalued through CTA, and when it is restored in extinction. Since
human and animal studies indicate that strengthening the mPFC can reduce negative affect we will then
determine if strengthening these circuits using two distinct approaches can restore positive affect and associated
neural function. We will use optogenetics (channelrhodopsin) to determine if targeted optical strengthening of
infralimbic (IL)-NAc shell and/or prelimbic (PrL)-NAc core is sufficient to reduce negative affect and enhance
CTA extinction. We will also examine if our novel rat transcranial alternating current (tACS) system, a relatively
noninvasive approach with great translational value, can also modulate disrupted cortical oscillations in CTA,
strengthen overall mPFC-NAc circuit coherence, and determine if this approach can increase positive affect. In
both optogenetics and tACS studies, we will focus on 20 Hz (beta) frequency given its role in ‘top-down’ cognitive
control as well as 80 Hz (gamma) frequency given studies that implicate this signaling in reward processing.
Collectively, this multi-faceted approach will provide important insight into how mPFC-NAc systems modulate
normal hedonic processing, how these systems are disrupted as negative affective states emerge and provide
the foundation for the ultimate goal of developing methods to restore aberrant circuit function and hasten
recovery from negative emotional states."
10886710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The long-term objective of this project is to investigate the fundamental immunological mechanisms
involved in the development of asthma and allergic airway diseases. Various atmospheric factors contribute to
the pathogenesis of these diseases, including viral infection, allergen exposure, and air pollution. It is
becoming increasingly clear that the airway epithelium plays a key role in orchestrating immune responses in
the airways. Nonetheless, the mechanisms involved in the initiation and development of immune responses to
environmental factors are not fully understood.
 Sensing of self-DNA by immune cells has been implicated in sterile inflammation in various organs and the
pathophysiology of diseases. We recently found that human airway epithelial cells rapidly release fragments of
nuclear DNA into the extracellular milieu following allergen exposure in vitro. Caspase-3 was rapidly activated
in airway epithelial cells upon allergen exposure without apparent signs of cellular apoptosis or necrosis. Self-
DNA was also released into the airway lumen in naïve mice exposed to allergens in vivo, and blocking
extracellular DNA (eDNA) suppressed type 2 immune responses to the allergens. Therefore, we hypothesize
that allergen-induced rapid extracellular release of self-DNA by airway epithelial cells promotes type 2 immune
responses to airborne allergens.
 The experiments described in this proposal will investigate this hypothesis by focusing on two fundamental
questions. In Aim 1, we will determine how DNA is rapidly released by airway epithelial cells in response to
allergen exposure in vitro. We will examine the mechanisms of non-canonical activation of caspase-3 and
calpains, which initiate and terminate active DNA release, respectively. In Aim 2, we will determine how
epithelium-derived eDNA promotes type 2 immunity and allergic airway inflammation in vivo. We will
investigate the role of the pattern recognition receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in sensing
eDNA and leading exaggerated effector functions of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and CD4+ T cells.
 We will employ a combination of complementary expertise in cellular and molecular biology of airway
epithelial cells and immunology and disease models of type 2 immunity in the laboratories of Dr. O’Grady and
Dr. Kita, respectively. Novel and robust in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for this project. These
studies will provide a better understanding of how airway epithelium responds to environmental allergens and
will define the key molecules responsible for type 2 immune responses in the airways. Ultimately, these studies
will characterize the critical mechanism(s) involved in allergen-induced immune responses, allowing for the
identification of novel therapeutic target(s) for treating and ideally preventing immune-mediated airway
diseases, such as asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and other allergic disorders."

The Cell Sciences Imaging Shared Resource (CSI-SR) provides high-resolution, state-of-the-art imaging
technologies for studying the molecular and structural organization of cells, tissue, and bio-engineered materials.
In addition to the Director, the CSI-SR is staffed by seven full-time staff scientists who have expertise and training
in electron and light microscopy. The CSI-SR is organized into three interdependent resources: (1) Fluorescence
Microscopy Core (FMC), (2) Electron Microscopy Core (EMC), and (3) the Multiplex and Array Tomography Core
(MAC). The CSI-SR provides imaging services to SCI members in two locations across Stanford's campus, the
School of Medicine (Beckman Center) and the School of Engineering Shriram Center (Bioengineering). The two
facilities house seven advanced imaging systems that provide confocal, deconvolution, 2-photon, lattice light
sheet, and super-resolution (SIM, gSTED) fluorescent light microscopy technologies, a bio-AFM as well as two-
electron microscopes for biological TEM and SEM imaging. Additionally, the CSI-SR provides access to training
and support on advanced software resources for 3D, 4D interactive, volume imaging of data sets (Improvision’s
Volocity, Bitplane’s Imaris), as well as advanced deconvolution software packages (SoftWoRx, and SVI
Huygens). Image analysis is further supported by the CSI-SR’s image analysis pipeline development service.
Members of all programs regularly use the CSI-SR, with the heaviest use coming from the Cancer Biology and
Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapeutics programs. In 2020, 35% of users were SCI investigators. The CSI-
SR contributed to over 18 cancer-focused publications (5 high-impact). The annual budget of the CSI-SR is
$1,340,953, yet the CCSG request is $103,390. Accordingly, the CI-SR leverages extensive institutional support
and seeks only 8% from CCSG funds."

The overall goal of the Texas Research Experience eXperiment (TREX) project is to create a sustainable
model for culturally relevant STEM learning environments that engage students' interests and prepare them for
careers in medicine, science, engineering, and technology. To this end, TREX will enhance training of high
school educators and students through a coordinated set of programs and activities that will build an enduring
mentoring “triad.” The triad will include (1) Texas A&M University (TAMU) faculty and trainees in the Schools of
Medicine and Public Health, and Colleges Education and Engineering, and (2) administrators, educators, and
students at a science magnet high school, and (3) a traditional public high school in south Texas. These
longitudinal mentoring relationships within the triad will promote sharing of resources and best practices,
facilitate the development of exportable, career centered, curricular modules, and provide enhanced
professional development for teachers and focused career development for students. Integrated
components that will provide longitudinal mentoring and career preparation include two-semester remote
TAMU faculty mentorship of high school teachers and students linked with on-campus TAMU summer
research internships for students. TREX focuses on school districts that are rural and have a high proportion
of students who are underserved and underrepresented in science and medicine. The multi-disciplinary
Project team, which includes experts in biomedical, health disparities, public health, and biomedical
engineering research, as well as educational theory, curriculum development, and evaluation, will work with
classroom teachers to develop innovative, career based, educational modules focused on 21st century
skills. Specifically, TREX aims (1) to provide high school teachers longitudinal mentorship to promote the
development of STEM instructional modules leading to an accredited, two-semester course for high school
juniors and seniors that includes journal clubs, hands-on experiments, and a seminar series to enhance STEM
foundation knowledge open to teachers, students, and community members; and (2) to provide rigorous,
mentored instruction for high school students on scientific inquiry fundamentals (semester 1) and authentic
research experiences (semester 2) through the creation of capstone projects that can be further actualized in
the laboratories of the TAMU faculty mentors during summer research internships.
All activities and products will be extensively evaluated using a quasi-experimental, mixed methods
approach, with a variety of instruments designed to collect and analyze the most pertinent data. These will
assess the effectiveness of the model in achieving the objectives of enhancing student interest and
developing the skills needed for educational and career success. The curriculum and framework developed
as part of TREX will be made publicly available to high schools and universities to encourage high school
research collaborations that spark similar programs."
10889382,"SUMMARY
Understanding the mechanisms underlying GPCR signaling is crucial in order to fully comprehend their role in
physiology and pathophysiology. In addition to canonical second messengers (cAMP, cGMP and IP3) and β-
arrestin signaling, small GTPase proteins, such as Rho GTPases are largely involved in GPCR-mediated signal
transduction. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) convert Rho GTPases from an inactive (GDP-bound)
state to an active state (GTP-bound). Rho-GEFs can be activated by Gq, G12/13 and Gs proteins. However,
currently there is no evidence that Gi/0-WT can directly activate RhoGEFs. PDZ domains are structural protein
domains that recognize simple linear amino acid motifs often at the protein C-terminal (C-motif). RhoA, activated
by PDZ-RhoGEFs, has important signaling roles, by activating phospholipase D (PLD) and transcription factors.
Kappa opioid receptor (KOR), an abundantly expressed GPCR that mainly couples to Gi/o, has a KPV C-motif
(last three amino acids) that binds PDZ class III proteins, including PDZ-RhoGEF. Our central hypothesis is that
KOR activation, in addition to engaging cAMP inhibition and β-arrestin pathways, initiates an additional signaling
mechanism downstream to PDZ-RhoGEF leading to activation of RhoA and subsequent activation of PLD.
Activation of PLD generates two distinct second messengers, phosphatidic acid, which activates the mTOR
pathway, and choline, which activates Sigma1 receptors. In addition to in vitro studies, this pathway that plays
an essential role in KOR signaling will be studied in vivo on antipruritic effects of KOR agonists. Antipruritic
effects of KOR agonists are well established and as of today, there is one FDA-approved KOR agonist
(difelikefalin) for the treatment of chronic itch of chronic kidney diseases. We will use a multidisciplinary approach,
combining state-of-the-art molecular and pharmacological approaches for a comprehensive investigation of the
signaling pathways elicited by activation of C-motifs of KOR. Receptor and PDZ-RhoGEF mutations,
measurements of second messenger levels (cAMP, choline and phosphatidic acid) as well as live imaging of
PLD activation will be used. Acute itch model of scratching will be used for in vivo studies. We provide solid
preliminary results supporting the feasibility of the project and the ability of our team to complete the work
proposed. The project has two aims: Aim 1. Investigate the role of PDZ-binding domain in KOR-induced
signaling; experiments are designed to characterize intracellular cascades activated by KOR-motifs (KOR-PDZ
binding domain). Aim 2. Investigate the role of PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA pathway in antipruritic effects of KOR
agonists. RoA and sigma 1 receptor antagonists will be tested on scratch inhibiting effects of three different KOR
agonists (U50,488 as prototype, nalbuphine, and difelikefalin as peripherally restricted). The successful
completion of this project will increase the current knowledge of GPCR signaling and will serve as a basis for
further development of ligands selectively targeting this pathway and drug development in the itch field."
10889599,"Project Summary:
Studies of presynaptic physiology at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) have traditionally relied
on the assumption that the probability of release is homogeneous across the hundreds of release
sites or active zones at these synapses. However, a growing collection of evidence suggests that
the probability of release varies widely across active zones at the NMJ. There is currently no
method to quantify the spatial distribution of active transmitter release sites with single vesicle
resolution at mammalian NMJs. Therefore, our main objective is to develop and use a new
approach to characterize the probability of neurotransmitter release at individual active zones of
mouse NMJs by improving upon previous attempts to visualize neurotransmitter release. We
propose to investigate heterogeneity in probability of release across the hundreds of mouse active
zones at the NMJ in the context of normal physiological and diseased conditions. We aim to
demonstrate this using a novel optical probe to resolve neurotransmitter release at the level of a
single quantal release event. For this purpose, we developed an optical probe by conjugating an
intensity-based acetylcholine sensing fluorescent reporter, iAChSnFR to an scFv antibody
fragment directed against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mAb35) that does not interfere with
the normal functioning of the receptor channel. Frist, we will characterize the probability of
transmitter release in healthy mouse NMJs. We will visualize synaptic vesicle release events
using our novel acetylcholine receptor-targeted acetylcholine sensor (iAChSnFR-mAb35) in the
mouse epitrochleoanconeus muscle and then calculate the probability of neurotransmitter release
from each live iAChSnFR-mAb35 transient recorded during synaptic activity by mapping these
events onto the localization of presynaptic active zones. Second, we will repeat this approach in
the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mouse NMJ evaluating the impact of disease
progression. We hypothesize that the regulation of transmitter release within active zones may
be different when comparing healthy and ALS NMJs. The proposed work promises to provide an
important new tool for studying the probability of neurotransmitter release and resolving
uncertainties in the heterogeneity of individual transmitter release-site function by correlating
active zone structure and function under normal physiological conditions and in disease. Such an
investigation promises to transform the ways in which we study and understand presynaptic
physiology and modulation of neurotransmitter release in healthy and disease states."

predoctoral slots and 3 postdoctoral slots. Our Cancer Biology Training Program is the only NCI-funded T32 at
UTHSA. We provide intensive and rigorous training in cancer research and discovery under the tutelage of
seasoned preceptors and professional development opportunities to highly motivated graduate students and
postdoctoral research fellows, especially those from groups underrepresented (UR) in biomedical research.
Since this T32 was first awarded in August 2011, all trainee positions (1 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral in each
award year) have been filled, and trainees have been highly productive. To date, 7 predoctoral students and 15
postdoctoral fellows have been appointed as T32 trainees, and 41% (2 predocs and 7 postdocs) are URs. The
Training Program will continue to be directed by the same Director and Co-Director, enhanced by a new Co-
Director, and overseen by a seasoned Executive Committee. The training faculty is diverse, with 19 full
professors and 5 associate professors, and 7 assistant professors as Co-Mentors, from 9 departments. All
training faculty have full faculty privileges in the Graduate School and our NCI-designated Mays Cancer Center
(MCC). Our training faculty are highly interactive with numerous collaborative publications, have strong funded
research portfolios (average direct costs >$870K per mentor in the current year), and are experienced and
successful in mentoring predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Many new Training Program-specific activities
leverage growing basic, translational and clinical cancer research opportunities (especially at the MCC) in
bioinformatics, drug development, and cutting-edge shared resources. Annual Retreats and bi-monthly
Trainees’ Luncheons will allow trainees to showcase their research advances and interact with the Program
Co-Directors, the training faculty, the External Advisory Board, and other trainees, including those who have
completed training. The curriculum also includes training in scientific communication and a strong base in
responsible conduct of research as well as rigor and reproducibility. Trainees will be selected for their
academic accomplishments and their dedication to cancer research and will be appointed for 2 years. There is
substantial institutional commitment to this Training Program, e.g. salary support for the Program Director, and
matching support from the MCC for a fourth predoctoral trainee. Our Cancer Biology Training Program seeks
this continuation to continue its contribution to diversity in the next generation of independent investigators
working to accomplish NCI’s goal of improving cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a serious and life-threatening condition, has increased in incidence for
hospitalized pediatric patients by 70-200%. This has led to increased morbidity, mortality and longer
hospitalizations, and is thought to be due to more effective care of children with serious and life-threatening
disorders. Unfortunately, it is unclear which children are at the highest risk of hospital acquired (HA) VTE and
how to prevent these events due to many studies being single center with small case numbers. This study
addresses the critical need to identify children at a high risk of HA-VTE using a risk assessment model
(RAM), but a low risk of bleeding. This cohort will be used as the target population for trials evaluating the
efficacy and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation in order to progress towards the long term goal of HA-VTE
prevention in children. The overall objectives of this study are to (1) prospectively validate a pediatric HA-VTE
RAM created through Dr. Jaffray’s multi-center Children’s Hospital Acquired Thrombosis (CHAT) Consortium
using a case-control study design and electronic medical record review (EMR); (2) evaluate the incidence and
characterization of bleeding in hospitalized children on and off anticoagulation through EMR review; and (3)
explore barriers to provider engagement with RAM implementation by conducting focus groups and semi-
structured interviews of inpatient medical teams using qualitative thematic analysis strategies. To achieve
these research aims, Dr. Jaffray has the immediate career goals to obtain new knowledge, skills, and
experience that will allow her to (1) analyze data from large datasets from multicenter studies and build and
validate risk models through multivariate analysis; (2) develop qualitative research skills to design and analyze
focus groups and semi-structured interviews; and (3) acquire the knowledge to plan and conduct randomized
controlled trials. Achieving these career goals will support her long term career goal of becoming an
independently funded, leader in the effort to determine efficacious and safe VTE prevention strategies in children
through multicenter randomized controlled trials. Dr. Jaffray will accomplish her research and training aims with
the support of her primary mentor, Dr. Guy Young (pediatric thrombosis clinical research), and co-mentors,
Dr. Neil Goldenberg (pediatric clinical trial research), Dr. Ernest Amankwah (biostatics), Dr. Neil Zakai (adult
thrombosis clinical research) and Dr. Elizabeth Burner (qualitative research). Dr. Jaffray’s plan for career
development is enhanced by the outstanding research environment at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and The

This two-year grant proposal responds to PAR-23-179, and its long-term goal is to advance the understanding
of biomarker in relation to preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This proposal seeks to leverage interpretable
and flexible tree-based methods, clinically and biologically informed tree decision rules, longitudinal
biomarkers, and risk and protective factors, to develop novel statistical methods and construct tree-based
algorithms. The novel methods and tree-based algorithms will help identify time-dynamic and personalized
biomarker subgroups at high risk for cognitive decline due to AD and predict progression risks.
AD is a devastating disease affecting over 6 million people in the U.S. and has burdened the U.S. healthcare
system and caregivers with increases. Importantly, evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process
begins many years, if not decades, before the diagnosis of AD dementia, and recent findings demonstrate that
biomarker deterioration starts many years before cognitive decline due to AD. Identifying high-risk subgroups
based on biomarker information will expand the window of opportunity during which therapeutic intervention
may have the greatest potential for success.
Tree-based methods appear well-suited for producing clinically applicable decision rules that leverage
complicated interactions between different biomarkers, and between biomarkers and risk factors. But existing
tree-based methods are limited in clinical relevance, biological interpretability, and statistical inference, and
novel methods are needed. Meanwhile, the consortium of multiple longitudinal follow-up studies presents new
opportunities and challenges. The Preclinical AD Consortium (PAC) data comprises five studies that have
been collecting longitudinal clinical, cognitive, biomarker, and genetic data from individuals who were
cognitively normal when first enrolled and followed for many years. The large sample size and the breadth of
the merged and harmonized data create opportunities for more precise and personalized classification and risk
prediction, based on longitudinal biomarkers and risk and protective factors. These opportunities also create
challenges for method development to be time-dynamic and personalized.
Projects supported by this proposal will seek to develop novel tree-based statistical methods for subgroup
identification and risk prediction for cognitive decline due to AD, and construct classification and prediction
algorithms using the PAC data. Our research team will pursue these goals through two Specific Aims: (1)
establish a time-dynamic and personalized statistical classification and prediction framework using tree-based
methods; and (2) leverage the PAC data to construct classification and prediction algorithms for onset of AD-
related clinical symptoms. Successful completion of these Aims will produce novel tree-based methodologies
and generate tree-based classification and prediction algorithms that predict onset of AD-related symptoms."

Declines in fluid, speed-dependent cognition (e.g., attention and memory) are a hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), but some degree of decline is also seen even in healthy older adults. Based on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the cortical disconnection theory
proposes that normal age-related cognitive decline is at least partly explained by the degradation of white
matter pathways connecting distributed brain regions, with greater white matter degradation in AD. An
important extension of this theory is to understand how white matter disconnection affects brain function in
both healthy aging and AD. However, the examination of age- and AD-related differences in white matter
connectivity, and its relation to brain function, is constrained by the relatively low resolution of standard DWI
data, which cannot accurately resolve fine-grained white matter regions with crossing fiber bundles or high
curvature. To address these limitations, this proposal will capitalize on a high-resolution multi-shot DWI
protocol that achieves spatial resolutions ≤ 1 mm3 on clinical 3T MRI scanners. Several studies of rodents and
younger adults already suggest that high-resolution DWI estimates white matter structural connectivity more
accurately than standard resolution DWI. This proposal will translate this earlier work by examining whether
standard (1.5 mm3 voxels; 3.375 𝜇l volume) and high-resolution (1 mm3; 1𝜇l volume) measures of white matter
structural connectivity differ in their relations to age and ability to explain age-related differences in cognitive
performance (Aim 1) or functional connectivity (Aim 2) in healthy adults across the lifespan (n = 140; ages 18-
80 years). This proposal will also examine the sensitivity of high-resolution DWI to white matter disconnection
and aberrant structure-function relations in adults with AD (n = 30; Aim 3). Cognition in the healthy adults will
be assessed using 12 tests of memory, executive function, and perceptual-motor speed. Structural (DWI) and
functional (resting-state functional MRI) connectivity will be assessed using a graph theoretical approach,
providing a novel basis for comparison between these different MRI modalities. Results from this clinically
feasible high-resolution DWI protocol will help answer fundamental questions about relations between
neurocognitive aging, brain structure, and brain function, which is important as the field is moving toward large-
scale, multimodal datasets. Ultimately, this project may identify additional age- and AD-related differences in
white matter connectivity that cannot be identified using only standard resolution DWI and may inform future
interventions targeting white matter connectivity to slow atypical cognitive decline. The wealth of neuroimaging
and aging resources available to the applicant at Duke University Medical Center will help her establish an
independent research program focused on multiple cognitive domains, graph theory, and advanced DWI
methodology, thereby propelling her toward her career goal of becoming a professor at a four-year university."
10892652,"The world urgently needs to advance the HIV cure research agenda to address the persistently high global HIV
prevalence and associated mortality. Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) in achieving
sustained control of viral replication, the concerns about side-effects, drug-drug interactions, drug resistance and
cost call for a need to identify strategies for achieving HIV eradication or an ART-free remission. Following ART
withdrawal, patients' viral load levels usually increase rapidly to a peak followed by a dip, and then stabilize at a
viral load set point. Characterizing features of the viral rebound trajectories (e.g., time to viral rebound and viral
set points) after analytic antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI) and identifying host, virological, and
immunological factors that are predictive of these features are central to HIV cure research. But doing so requires
addressing a variety of analytical challenges, including the non-linear viral rebound trajectories, coarsened data
due to the assay's limit of quantification, intermittent measurements of viral load values, small sample sizes from
individual studies, and high-dimensional candidate predictors. Motivated by our ongoing collaborations with HIV
cure research investigators and built on our previous work, we aim to address key methodological gaps by
leveraging data from multiple randomized studies conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group and from the
Zurich Primary HIV Infection Cohort. Aim 1 proposes to develop a new set of methods for prediction of time to
viral rebound based on comprehensive history profiles, such as the rate of viral decay after ART initiation,
extending fitting algorithms and variable selection techniques developed for interval-censored outcomes. Aim 2
proposes to fit the viral rebound model using a Smoothed Simulated Pseudo Maximum likelihood method which
maximizes a smoothed simulated objective function constructed based on a Monte Carlo approximation of the
first two moments of the smoothed responses, and to develop methods to assess the association between time
to rebound and the viral set point and to simultaneously select biomarkers that affect different finer features of
the viral rebound trajectory. Aim 3 proposes to develop methods that optimally integrate data from multiple
cohorts and different phases of viral load trajectories while properly accounting for the homogeneity and
heterogeneity in covariate effects across studies. Innovation lies in the development and application of new
methods for modeling viral rebound that address various inherent challenges in analyses of available data.
Significance lies in the role of these methods in better characterizing viral rebound trajectories, identifying pre-
ATI predictors, and assessing the effects and mechanisms of novel therapeutic agents. The results of the
proposed research can inform optimal design of future ATI studies and provide new tools that can extract more
information from data collected in completed and ongoing ATI studies. These new insights are useful in the
discovery of pre-ATI predictors of better viremia control post ATI and evaluation of interventions that target
different components of viral rebound process, ultimately improving our capacity to find a cure for HIV."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and current
therapy only treats symptoms but cannot stop progression of this debilitating disease. COPD is defined as a
clinical syndrome characterized by respiratory symptoms, airflow limitation that is irreversible, and pulmonary
structure abnormalities (emphysema and/or airways disease). The key pathologic features of COPD lungs are
chronic inflammation, tissue destruction, and vascular abnormalities. Emerging data points to the centrality of
the lung microvasculature to the pathogenesis of COPD but little is known of how vascular damage leads to
progressive lung destruction. This proposal addresses the critical need to define the mechanism(s) of vascular
pathogenesis of COPD to provide a therapeutic path forward and to reduce the morbidity and mortality for millions
of patients with this disease. We have shown that in human COPD lung tissue loss of expression of key
endothelial markers, suggestive of vascular dysfunction, is profound and linked to disease severity. We also
found vascular dysfunction in a murine model of emphysema and showed that restoring the pulmonary vascular
niche with pulmonary capillary endothelial cell (PCEC) therapy ameliorated emphysema. These data support
the novel concept that the “pulmonary vascular niche” is critical to the integrity of the alveolar-capillary unit, but
these results are the first to show that re-establishing the pulmonary endothelial compartment can change the
course of the emphysematous state. In PCECs isolated from emphysematous lung, leucine-rich alpha-2-
glycoprotein-1 (Lrg1) was a top up-regulated gene. LRG1, is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to the TGF-𝜷
accessory receptor that in ECs distorts their signaling to cause aberrant blood vessels in several disease states.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that excessive levels of PCEC-derived LRG1 alters homeostatic functions of
PCECs leading to a dysregulated vascular niche whereby the development of emphysema ensues. Aim

and the strength of the track record of strong mentorship of early-stage investigators.

Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology.
Approximately 20% of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1. Loss of KEAP1
hyper-activates NRF2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD. Furthermore, LUAD patients with
KEAP1 mutations do not respond to standard-of-care, including the recently approved KrasG12C inhibitors,
making this one of the most aggressive and hard to treat solid tumors. Building on our prior studies, we have
observed that KEAP1 mutant cells have an altered metabolism that can be therapeutically targeted. In this
application we focus on characterizing the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of targeting the
polyol and fructolysis pathways by both genetic and pharmacological approaches in multiple KRAS-driven
KEAP1 mutant LUAD pre-clinical models. In addition, using newly established models of KrasG12C-mutant
LUAD with KEAP1 mutations we will determine the therapeutic potential of standard of care KrasG12C inhibitor
Sotorasib in combination with a KHK inhibitor that blocks fructolysis. Ultimately, our studies will provide a
rationale for inhibiting the fructolysis in KEAP1 mutant LUAD and support the sub-stratification of patients with
hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to therapies targeting the polyol and fructolysis
pathways, which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine."

the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Neuropathologists (AANP). The National Plan to Address
Alzheimer’s Disease calls for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD) by 2025. Critical to this goal is maintaining, developing, and supporting neuropathology trainees to fill
the dearth of academic neuropathologists dedicated to ADRD and aging research. Towards this end, the annual
AANP meeting represents a national focal point for neuropathology trainees. The first AANP Scholars’
Workshop was held in June 2020 and has been remarkably successful in guiding neuropathology trainees
towards an academic neuropathology career. This R13 grant will fund the AANP Scholar’s Program which is a
career development and scientific pre-meeting workshop for a cohort of 75 neuropathology trainees over five
years. Workshop themes will alternate every other year between “Expectations and Barriers to an Academic
Neuropathology Career” and “Navigating Academic Neuropathology: Positions & Grants.” This workshop will
attract the most promising neuropathology trainees towards a career focused on ADRD by offsetting travel and
registration costs. This R13 grant will also support trainee travels awards to attend the Annual AANP Meeting
with a focus on supporting women and underrepresented minorities. The long-term impact of this meeting will
be to maintain a healthy pipeline of neuropathology trainees dedicated to ADRD research in support of the

Upper limb reaching and grasping movements require complex cortical control circuits involving both motor-
control outputs and real-time somatosensory feedback. Neurological disorders such as strokes, brain
trauma, and spinal cord injury may result in a loss of the ability to perform these tasks. Many teams, including
our own, are working to restore upper extremity function by using human neural signals to control the
movements of a robotic limb with multiple degrees of freedom [1-3]. However, without somatosensory
feedback, even the most basic limb movements are difficult to perform in a fluid and natural manner [4, 5].
There have only been a limited number of human studies exploring how to generate somatosensory feedback.
Using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) grids placed on the human primary somatosensory (S1) hand area
in patients with epilepsy who require intracranial monitoring, we propose studies directed toward understanding
how somatosensation is cortically encoded and how we can restore upper extremity somatosensation via
electrical stimulation. To accomplish this, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team, led by Dr.
Gianluca Lazzi, with an established history of success in mentoring early investigators. From my mentoring
team, I plan on learning about neural modeling, study design and biostatistics, and medical device
development. My long-term goal is to become an independent NIH-funded neurosurgeon-scientist who makes
significant contributions to our understanding of sensorimotor integration. In Aim 1 we will use the participants
own ECoG responses to real touch to guide a systematic mapping of stimulation parameter space to find
distinct percepts of somatosensation. Much like how clinical neurostimulators such as deep brain stimulators
(DBS) for movement disorders and vagus nerve stimulators (VNS) are therapeutic only at specific stimulation
settings, we hypothesize that we will find specific stimulation combinations that result in different types of
somatosensation. In Aim 2 we will compare task performance using artificial somatosensation versus native
touch. In Aim 3 we will quantify how real touch and artificial somatosensation generated by ECoG stimulation
differ in response time between real touch/stimulation and participant perception. These results and the
mentoring provided through this K23 program will be a critical foundation for my transition to an independent
investigator in sensorimotor integration."

The fundamental concept of Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases (DOHaD), which posits that early-
life events or exposures determine the health outcomes across the life span, has been well represented by the
US DOHaD Society exemplified by its annual national meeting since its inception in 2016. Its annual meeting
brings together investigators with diverse backgrounds who otherwise may not likely interact, including those
researching in the areas of developmental biology, life course epidemiology, nutrition, environmental toxicology,
cancer, stress, and endocrinology. Such individuals span institutions across the US from universities to industry
to government agencies (NIH, EPA, NIEHS) to share knowledge and recent advancements on how
environmental toxicants, nutrients, pharmaceutical agents, pathogens, gut microbiota, stress, and emerging
factors influence developing fetuses and newborns, and thereby contribute to their health and disease across
the life span. Further, presentations also delve into how such factors might lead to harmful effects in the
subsequent generations, i.e., transgenerational effects. The major goal of the US DOHaD Society’s annual
meeting is to foster multidisciplinary interactions and promote collaborations on these diverse topics. The second
objective is to provide opportunity for trainees (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) to
interact with world-renown experts, facilitating the development of future scientists and career opportunities in
the field. The third objective is to continue promoting diversity, inclusivity, and equal representation of sex, gender
and underrepresented minority groups as speakers and session leaders. Notably, women and minority
represented >50% and >20% speakers and moderators, respectively, over the last five meetings. The past five
conferences have been enormously successful, particularly the 2021 hybrid (in-person and virtual) meeting
despite the ongoing COVID pandemic. Such successes provide impetus for continued and permanent annual
meetings. The 6th, 7th, and 8th Annual Meetings will again be a hybrid format and held at the University of
Minnesota (Minneapolis, 2022), the Mercy’s Children Hospital (Kansas City, 2023) and the Rizzo Center (Chapel
Hill, 2024), respectively. The theme for the 2022 meeting will be “Environmental Exposures: Assessment
Methodologies, Mechanisms, and Health Outcomes”. Analogous to the 2021 meeting, the program will include
a dedicated day on career development and grant writing that will be provided in kind to all trainees. Preliminary
themes for 2023 and 2024 will cover topics including maternal microbiota and child development, exosomes as
carriers of biomarkers, effects of maternal supplemental folate, choline and DHA on offspring health outcomes
associated with epigenomic changes, and epidemiological analyses of long-term health outcomes associated
with heat stress during pregnancy and lactation. In short, the strength of the U.S. DOHaD Society lies in its

10867436,"Project Summary
 Tense and agreement (T/A) deficits are routinely assessed and treated when children with
Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) speak mainstream dialects of English and other languages, yet these
grammar structures are typically excluded from clinical practice when children with DLD speak a nonmainstream
dialect of English, such as African American English (AAE) or Southern White English (SWE). Excluding such
structures is grounded in a fear of misinterpreting a child's nonmainstream dialect forms as a disorder, yet this
practice leads to a disparity in the structures that can be assessed and treated across dialects. Fortunately, in a
recent NIH-funded study conducted in the Deep South, we created a novel dialect-informed and strategically
scored sentence recall task targeting T/A, and this task differentiated children with and without DLD within AAE
and SWE with relatively high levels of accuracy1. These results call for a paradigm shift and the inclusion of T/A
structures within clinical practice for all children.
 The next step toward bringing a dialect-informed and strategically scored sentence recall task targeting
T/A to clinicians involves testing its ecological validity with children who present an expanded range of dialectal
and psycholinguistic profiles. In addition, there is a need to systematically test the T/A structures within the task
in different syntactic frames and evaluate the strategic scoring approach to further understand and maximize
their contribution to diagnostic outcomes. Finally, theoretical questions exist as to why sentence recall might be
a good discriminator of children with and without DLD across dialects, with one possibility being that this task
interfaces with additional abilities that differentiate these groups beyond children's T/A systems, such as their
vocabulary, working memory, and phonological short-term memory2,3. If so, we need to know if sentence recall
interfaces with these abilities differentially depending on a child's clinical status and/or dialectal profile.
 Working within an innovative Disorder within Dialects framework, the proposed project seeks to further
test the diagnostic accuracy and theoretical basis of a sentence recall task targeting T/A by: recruiting children
who produce an expanded range of AAE and SWE (Aim 1); including children who present an expanded range
of nonverbal IQ scores (Aim 2); testing each T/A form in a variety of syntactic frames and evaluating the scoring
approach to optimize the task (Aim 3a and 3b); and testing between dialects and clinical groups, the relationship
between the children's sentence recalls, their T/A systems, and their other psycholinguistic abilities (Aim 4). To
achieve these aims, we will collect data from children with and without DLD in kindergarten and 1st grade in six
different dialect communities (AAE: rural, suburban, urban; SWE: rural, suburban, urban). The proposed work
will be the first of its kind to detail the dialectal and psycholinguistic variation that exists between and within AAE-
and SWE-speaking children who live in the Deep South and evaluate with rigor a sentence recall task targeting
T/A for these children."
10867529,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by the
bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). SFTSV is transmitted by the Haemaphysalis longicornis tick, which is native
to East Asia but recently established invasive populations in the United States and continues to expand in
geographic range. The rising incidence of SFTS cases in Asia, lack of specific treatment strategies, high case
fatality rates, and global range expansion of the tick vector make SFTS a public health concern. As a tick-borne
virus, SFTSV is unique from single-host viruses because it must replicate and survive in both vertebrate and
invertebrate hosts. Currently, there is a critical need to elucidate the intra-tick and intra-host infection dynamics
that enable bunyaviruses to infect, disseminate, and persist within the distinct environments of the tick and
vertebrate host. Acquiring this fundamental knowledge is paramount to developing novel strategies that prevent
SFTSV transmission. This research proposal is in direct response to NIH RFA-AI-21-046, “Promoting
Bunyavirales Basic Science Research.” The overall objective is to define the dynamics of SFTSV infection,
dissemination, and cell tropism within the tick vector, as well as the tick-to-host transmission timeline and initial
SFTSV–host interactions in the skin. The central hypothesis is that biotic factors associated with H. longicornis’
life cycle facilitate intra-tick SFTSV dissemination to the salivary glands after molting, which in turn enables the
tick to rapidly transmit SFTSV to the next vertebrate host on which it feeds while creating an immunologically
privileged microenvironment at the skin site of tick feeding. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) Characterize the dynamics of SFTSV infection, dissemination, and transstadial survival within
H. longicornis ticks; and, 2) Define the minimum tick-to-host transmission time of SFTSV and the early host
cutaneous immune response to SFTSV-infected tick feeding. Completion of these aims will define the infection
kinetics and cell tropism of SFTSV within the tick vector across multiple life stages and within the skin of the
vertebrate host. The proposed studies will be the first to collectively examine the intra-tick and intra-host infection
dynamics of a tick-borne bunyavirus. Elucidating the fundamental H. longicornis–SFTSV–vertebrate host
interactions will enable future work towards the development of rational interventions that disrupt virus survival
within, and transmission between, the tick and vertebrate host."
10867443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Language Impairment is one of the most common communication disorders treated by speech-language
pathologists. The disorder is characterized by impaired development of spoken language that cannot be
attributed to hearing loss, intellectual disabilities, or other known neurological deficits (Benton, 1964). A major
challenge in developing effective interventions for DLD is that the impaired learning mechanism underling the
disorder is not yet understood. The project’s overarching goal is to fill this critical gap, so that treatment can be
delivered in a manner that maximizes learning success. A leading theory suggests that the underlying cause for
the language learning difficulties in children with DLD is a deficit in the ability to implicitly extract regularities.
Within the framework of this theory, explicit learning strategies should be used to support learning in children
with this disorder. Indeed, treatment provided to school-age children with DLD relies heavily on explicit learning
by breaking down complex linguistic structures and syntactic regularities into small units that are taught explicitly,
using verbalization and memorization. However, these teaching techniques may not be effective as rely on
language-based explicit learning that is known to be significantly affected in children with DLD. The proposed
project will test a novel hypothesis whereby that the learning deficit in DLD is rooted in an ineffective management
of the interaction between explicit and implicit learning, caused by an impaired executive function of shifting. The
project proposes that children with DLD demonstrate overreliance on explicit learning, and are failing to initiate
a shift to implicit learning during complex learning, because of their impaired executive function of shifting. The
project will examine behaviorally and at the neurophysiological level learning of complex structures by children
with DLD and by their age and gender matched peers. Learning outcomes, use of strategies, and
electrophysiological measured of implicit knowledge will be assessed in relation to the children’s shifting abilities,
using two learning paradigms. The two learning paradigms will vary in the extent to which explicit learning is
suppressed to evaluate whether eliminating the need to overcome the explicit bias and to initiate a shift improves
complex learning in DLD. A well-established electrophysiological measure (the P600 event related potential that
detects implicit knowledge of grammatical violations) will determine whether explicit learning hinders the
acquisition and/or the expression of implicit knowledge in DLD.
Understanding whether learning of complex structures in DLD is facilitated by the suppression of explicit learning
strategies and by eliminating the need to shift from explicit to implicit learning will lead to improvement in the
teaching techniques employed with children with DLD, and to the development of effective interventions that
take into consideration these children’s unique learning profile."
10863726,"All modern randomized controlled trials for patients with mCRPC have included a backbone of continuous
medical or surgical castration in control and experimental arms. Unfortunately, continuous medical castration
virtually guarantees ongoing side effects that are predictably detrimental to quality of life. Theoretical rationales
notwithstanding, there is no definitive empirical evidence that maintaining castrate levels of testosterone is
required during ongoing treatment of patients with mCRPC. In fact, modern prospective data strongly suggests
that (1) ongoing medical castration therapy is likely not required if patients are receiving active non-AR directed
therapy, and (2) restoration of physiologic testosterone investigated in combination with such therapy will
improve quality of life.
 Most mCRPCs over-express PSMA which is amenable to PSMA targeted radiopharmaceuticals that
deliver beta-particle radiation selectively to PSMA positive cells and their immediate surroundings. Metastasis
directed SBRT enables safe and accurate precision delivery of ablative doses of ionizing radiation to metastatic
lesions independent of PSMA expression. Comprehensive systemic targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy
combined with metastasis directed ablative tumor directed therapy might not only delay progression, but also
create a critical window of opportunity to restore physiologic levels of testosterone and thereby potentially enable
Veterans time with normal vitality, hormonal function, and even sexual function.
 We propose: a Phase II Trial Of TargetEd Radiation with No CastraTion for mCRPC (POTENT-C). By
leveraging advances in non-AR directed active therapy for mCRPC, our proposal promises to improve treatment
efficacy and quality of life for Veterans with mCRPC. Specifically, we hypothesize that comprehensive non-
hormonal therapy in the form of PSMA targeted radioligand therapy combined with metastasis directed SBRT,
followed by physiologic restoration of testosterone will (1) improve efficacy of therapy for Veterans with
mCRPC while simultaneously (2) improving quality of life.
 POTENT-C is a single arm Phase II clinical trial of PSMA targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy and
comprehensive metastasis directed therapy followed by palliative testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in
Veterans with mCRPC who have progressed on at least one prior second generation anti-AR therapy. We
hypothesize that this therapeutic approach will both improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for Veterans.
Planned therapeutic interventions include two cycles of Lu-177 PSMA PNT2002 separated by 8 weeks with
intervening metastasis directed SBRT to all visible sites of disease. Four weeks after this planned therapy,
Veterans are re-imaged and those without suspicion of radiographic progression are planned for symptomatic
palliation with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). • The primary endpoint is six-month radiographic
progression free survival per PCWG3 criteria. Secondary endpoints include safety, additional measures of
therapeutic efficacy, and patient reported quality of life using validated tools. Exploratory endpoints investigate
possible prognostic value of imaging and genomic derived biomarkers.
 The POTENT-C trial challenges long-standing paradigms of maintaining castrate levels of testosterone
in patients treated for mCRPC. If Veterans with mCRPC can be effectively treated without the need for ongoing
castration and without detriment to survival, this would undoubtedly be broadly celebrated by Veterans with
prostate cancer and their partners. It would also shift fundamental understandings of castration resistant disease
biology. If successful, the fundamental treatment paradigm for mCRPC requiring indefinite castration therapy
would pivot. This would be transformative."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD) are a growing concern in our aging population. The
identification of modifiable risk factors is critical. Growing evidence links ADRD to traffic-related air pollution
(TRAP), a complex mixture of gasses and particles that includes ultrafine particles (UFP, ≤ 100 nm diameter),
black carbon (BC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), fine particles (PM2.5) and other pollutants. The impact of TRAP
mixtures as a whole (vs individual pollutants) on ADRD, the most relevant pollutants, and critical
exposure periods, however, have not been identified to support future evidence-based interventions and
regulations. Moreover, most epidemiologic air pollution studies have investigated clinical cognitive outcomes;
few have investigated neuropathologic changes more closely tied to mechanisms. UFPs may have an
increased neurotoxic potential because of their small size. UFP health studies are limited because UFPs are
not regularly monitored, and they require novel monitoring techniques. The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT)
study is one of the largest, most extensive community-based autopsy cohorts in the world. My team previously
developed the first-of-their-kind, UFP/TRAP exposure surfaces using an innovative mobile monitoring design in
2019 for this cohort. I will apply my expertise in exposure science developing long-term TRAP models
and UFP monitoring campaigns along with new training in ADRD neuropathology, exposure mixtures,
and advanced epidemiologic methods to address the following important gaps. In Aim 1, I will evaluate
associations between exposures to UFP/TRAP mixtures and late-life ADRD neuropathological changes at
autopsy and determine whether these effects are magnified in women, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, or
individuals with lower socioeconomic status. In Aim 2, I will collect additional UFP data and develop the first
long-term UFP exposure surfaces. In Aim 3, I will evaluate long-term UFP/TRAP exposures and ADRD
neuropathologies; identify the exposure periods that may be most relevant for the development of
neuropathologies; and address potential survival biases in autopsy studies – a concern that has received scant
epidemiologic attention but may be a concern when the exposure of interest (e.g., air pollution) increases risk
of death (i.e., autopsy) at younger ages when neuropathologies are naturally less severe. My training plan,
which consists of an excellent mentorship team of international experts, specific training goals, professional
development, and transition to independence will position me to successfully develop the skills and
experiences needed to lead this study. I will be uniquely qualified to develop a career independently leading
novel and original studies in the fields of ADRD neuropathologies and environmental exposure mixtures."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic
dysregulation, which promote fibroproliferative pulmonary arterial remodeling, right ventricular failure (RV), and
early death despite current PAH therapies. Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality
and RV dysfunction, emphasizing a need to understand metabolic drivers of vessel remodeling in PAH. Using
network medicine, we identify proline metabolism as functionally relevant to PAH. In a model of advanced-stage
PAH in vivo, multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) reveals increased endothelial incorporation of
stable isotope proline tracer as well as the presence of “hotspots” of proline signal in collagen fibrils, proliferating
cells, and extracellular matrix—which we define collectively as, “biomass.” As histological analysis of early-stage
inflammatory PAH shows significant deposition of collagen prior to the development of severe pulmonary
hypertension, it follows that endothelial proline dysregulation may be present in early-stage PAH. The central
goal of the proposed R03 is to understand proline dysregulation in control and PAH pulmonary artery endothelial
cells (PAECs) in vitro, early-stage PAH (esPAH) in vivo, and in human PAH.
Using systems biology, we identify C-terminal src kinase (Csk), as a regulator of fibrosis and metabolism in early-
stage PAH. Csk is known inhibit the metabolic regular Src through phosphorylation of Src tyrosine 527
(pTyr527Src). We demonstrate that inflammation reduces Csk expression on the plasma membrane, which may
have implications for Src-dependent regulation of proline. We hypothesize that inflammation impairs Csk
recruitment to the plasma membrane, leading to decreased pTyr527Src, and enhanced Src-dependent proline
incorporation by HPAECs to support cell proliferation, synthesis of endothelial biomass, and vasculopathy in
esPAH. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Establish Csk-Src regulation of HPAEC proline availability
and fibroproliferative biomass in vitro, 2) Establish Csk-Src dependent proline dysregulation in experimental
esPAH and human PAH in vivo. Understanding Csk-Src dependent proline dysregulation will complement K08
career development activities, establish a novel metabolic driver of PAH inception, and support a future R01
application to study proline dysregulation in early-stage PAH."
10867486,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-organ disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 
genes. TSC is a challenging disease to approach as there are many involved organ systems, which 
have distinct profiles of symptom onset, disease progression, and in some cases even stability or 
regression of the benign tumors known as hamartomas. These multiple examples of distinct time 
courses in each organ system strongly suggest that  the TSC1/TSC2  genes  control  cell  signaling 
 pathways  that  are  tissue  specific  and  developmentally regulated, resulting in lesions that 
present at different times in the lifetime of the patient. These pathways certainly include  mTOR  
kinase  signaling,  but  critical  upstream  and  downstream  regulators  of  this  developmentally 
regulated process in specific tissues remain poorly understood. The neurological manifestations of 
TSC are typically severe at very early ages and include epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, 
and behavioral/psychiatric disorders. Recent findings in human cell-derived model systems suggest 
that neural development is disrupted in TSC, and that proper regulation of mTOR signaling is 
especially important in human brain in comparison to other mammals. However, the cellular 
mechanisms connecting TSC1/2 mutation and the phenotypic outcomes of this mutation are not well 
understood. This project will use patient-derived cells and single-cell measurements of protein and 
RNA to measure altered signaling pathways in various cell types of the human brain and also address 
how these abnormalities impact specific developmental stages. Examined stages will span early 
neural progenitor cells to more mature neurons found in the postnatal brain. Human induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)  from  patients carrying  TSC2 mutations will  be  used to generate  
lineage-committed progenitors and differentiated neurons and glia. We will also use freshly 
resected human tubers as well as previously resected human tubers that have been fixed and stored, 
and will employ custom-designed computational pipelines to compare the developmental trajectories 
of TSC2-mutant cells to matched controls and larger published datasets. Using cutting edge cell 
imaging and analysis protocols, we will test the overarching hypothesis that tubers from patients  
with  TSC  and  stem  cell  derivative  neural  cells  and  tissues  have  mTOR-dependent  and  
mTOR- independent signaling abnormalities that are lineage- and temporally-restricted. Finally, we 
will quantitatively compare signaling dynamics in specific developmental stages and lineages 
between TSC2 mutant cells and cells derived from a second “mTORopathy” with overlapping but 
non-identical clinical features, to dissect the function  of  different  components  of  this  
pathway  in  neural  development  and  pathogenesis  and  reveal
compensatory signaling after treatment of cells carrying TSC2 or DEPDC5 mutations."
10867487,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
The objective of this NIA K23 proposal is to support my continued scientific growth towards becoming an
independent translational, interventional neuropsychologist. Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome (ACS) involves
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a stage preceding dementia, and has multiple risk factors.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one significant risk factor that remains poorly understood. An earlier onset of
ACS has been linked to a TBI history, and my group published one of the first theoretical mechanistic models
that posited biological changes involved in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) may be
increased from TBI. While moderate and severe TBI have a well-established link to ACS, it is unclear if mild
TBI (mTBI), the most common TBI type, has a similar relationship. More information is needed to determine if
biological changes in ACS, and possibly ADRD, might relate to mTBI. Such information can be generated from
biomarker probing. The recent advent of high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and
blood-derived biomarker tools provide sophisticated new methods to probe biomarkers, specifically neural
circuit integrity and neuronal injury/inflammation. To accomplish my career development and research goals,
we have created a comprehensive training plan to develop new skills to probe biomarkers of neural circuit
integrity and neuronal injury/inflammation to inform if biological changes in ACS relate to a history of mTBI.
Through the K23, I will gain new knowledge about biological changes in ADRD and TBI, different fluid-based
biomarker approaches, multiple noninvasive brain stimulation methods, translational research, leadership/
governance, and scientific networking. Training will include mentorship, didactic coursework, hands-on
experiences, and the scientific study. The mentoring team is an interdisciplinary group of leaders with expertise
in ADRD, TBI, noninvasive brain stimulation, biomarkers, neurobehavioral research design, and academic
career development. The scientific study’s overarching hypothesis is that the risk for aMCI associated with
mTBI will manifest as reduced HD-tDCS-measured neural circuit integrity and elevated blood biomarkers of
neuronal injury/inflammation. The proposal will leverage the UT Southwestern Alzheimer Disease Center to
enroll adults with aMCI. Aim 1 will determine if neural circuit integrity involved in verbal episodic memory in
aMCI is reduced based on a history of mTBI by using a within-subjects design to apply three HD-tDCS
conditions. Aim 2 will determine if key blood-derived markers of neuronal injury/inflammation in aMCI are
elevated based on having an mTBI history. The K23 proposal will provide essential data and first-authored
publications to prepare my first NIA R01, enable me to independently design clinical/translational research that
incorporates biomarkers, and position me to achieve my overall career goal of informing the biological
mechanisms linking onset of ACS, and potentially ADRD, to a history of TBI. Once these goals have been
achieved, I will utilize the new insights to explore potential therapeutic interventions later in my career."
10867490,"Title: Angiopoietin-2/Tie2 signaling regulation of liver metastasis in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver metastases are found in nearly half of PanNET patients at diagnosis while many others develop liver
metastasis after surgical resection of the primary tumor. Though the incidence of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors (PanNET) has increased steadily over recent decades, there are only limited therapeutic options for
metastatic PanNET patients. Furthermore, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) showed the limited efficacy in
patients with metastatic PanNET due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, understanding
the mechanisms underlying liver metastasis, immune evasion, and their convergence on ICI therapy resistance
in PanNET is urgently necessary to improve the clinical management of advanced PanNET.
 Vascular destabilization is recognized as a hallmark of tumor growth and metastasis. Angiopoietin-2
(Ang2), which binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, is a potent vascular destabilizing factor. We
demonstrated that under inflammatory conditions, Ang2 suppresses Tie2 signaling and promotes vascular
destabilization and leakage. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that vascular destabilization facilitates
tumor immune evasion by impairing immune cell infiltration. In preliminary studies using a spontaneous
PanNET mouse model, we found that Ang2 inhibition suppresses liver metastatic growth and improves the
survival. Ang2 inhibition also reduced vascular leakage and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration in metastases.
We previously showed that suppression of Tie2 signaling is accompanied by ectodomain cleavage of the Tie2
coreceptor, Tie1, resulting in increased circulating levels of soluble Tie1 (sTie1). Our preliminary studies show
that elevated plasma sTie1 levels in PanNET patients have significant prognostic implications.
 In this project, we will elucidate the mechanisms underlying Ang2-mediated liver metastatic progression,
immunosuppression, and anti-PD-1 therapy resistance in metastatic PanNET. In Aim 1, we will determine the
contribution of Ang2-mediated vascular destabilization to liver metastatic progression in PanNET by using
human liver metastases and function-blocking antibodies or genetic Ang2 deletion in spontaneous and
experimental PanNET mouse models. Mechanistically, in Aim 2, we will determine whether Ang2-mediated
vascular leakage impairs CD8+ T-cell infiltration in liver metastases, serving as the basis for assessing the
effects of Ang2 inhibition combined with anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic PanNET. We will determine if Ang2
blockade sensitizes PanNET liver metastases to anti-PD-1 therapy by promoting vascular stabilization and
CD8+ T-cell infiltration in PanNET mice. Finally, Aim 3 will identify circulating levels of sTie1 at diagnosis as a
potential biomarker for tumor aggressiveness in PanNET patients. Successful completion of this project, which
elucidates the mechanisms underlying vascular regulation of the immune evasion, could significantly enhance
the clinical management of metastatic PanNET, as well as provide insights for the treatment of metastatic
disease deriving from other tumor types, especially those with poor response to ICI therapy."

10867491,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurobehavioral characteristics have the potential to predict initial weight loss and weight loss maintenance in
response to various treatment approaches in adolescents with obesity. However, prior research is limited by
heavy reliance on cross-sectional analyses and a focus on immersion-type interventions (e.g., inpatient
treatment), which are not widely available. Identifying neurobehavioral predictors of response to clinically
applicable treatments will stimulate needed progress in the emerging field of precision medicine. Building on a
funded, randomized comparative effectiveness trial (R01-DK123273), the current study will prospectively
examine neurobehavioral predictors of initial weight loss response and weight loss maintenance for
adolescents with obesity participating in intensive lifestyle modification therapy (LMT) or low intensity LMT plus
medical management using the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA), semaglutide. In the
proposed study we will: 1) identify baseline neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss response in adolescents
with obesity undergoing intervention; 2) for participants achieving >5% BMI reduction at 6 months (i.e. initial
responders), identify neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss maintenance at 12; and 3) evaluate differences
in predictors of response between intensive LMT and GLP-1RA therapy. This prospective, observational study
will include 116 adolescents with obesity and will focus on the three main aspects of executive functions -
inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory – as well as reward responsivity using gold-standard
measures. For each domain, a single factor (i.e., score) will be created from factor analysis and these latent
factors will be used as predictors in the statistical models. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to
evaluate neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss response to GLP-1RA therapy in adolescents. Moreover,
we will be one of few who have prospectively evaluated neurobehavioral predictors of treatment response and
weight loss maintenance for adolescents with obesity. Our overarching goal is to move beyond the current
“one-size-fits-all” paradigm and understand how to best match adolescents with obesity to personally effective
treatment, which will maximize clinical outcomes while minimizing exposure to unnecessary risks."
10875125,"ABSTRACT
Loss of oligodendrocytes gives rise to demyelination, ultimately resulting in axonal degeneration and debilitating
clinical outcomes in diseases like Multiple Sclerosis. While remyelination can prevent neurodegeneration, there
are currently no approved therapies for promoting remyelination. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify factors
that control remyelination. Neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone are one of the sources of
remyelinating oligodendrocytes. These cells are a heterogeneous population that show diverse responses to
signaling pathways in the healthy vs demyelinated brain. We have studied one such pool marked by Gli1, which
generates remyelinating oligodendrocytes only in response to demyelination. Our previous work showed that the
recruitment and differentiation into oligodendrocytes leading to functional recovery is increased substantially by
loss of Gli1 in this pool of neural stem cells; however the molecular mechanisms involved in this repair is not
known. Through a transcriptomic analysis comparing gene expression in neural stem cells with and without Gli1
expression, we identified the TGFβ1 pathway as a major regulator of remyelination mediated by neural stem
cells. However, the effects of TGFβ1 signaling are context dependent and differ with the cell-type, timing and
dosage suggesting the presence of specific modulators of the pathway in different cells. Using a combination of
bioinformatic analysis and remyelination studies in mice, we discovered a novel mediator of the TGFβ1 pathway,
Gpnmb which is highly expressed along with its receptor CD44 in neural stem cells in response to demyelination.
In the first aim, we will define the cell-autonomous function of Gpnmb in neural stem cells and its role in
remyelination by neural stem cells. In the second aim, we will determine the impact of paracrine Gpnmb signaling
through CD44 receptor on remyelination mediated by neural stem cells. In the third aim, we will elucidate the
mechanisms of regulation of Gpnmb by TGFβ1 ligand and reciprocal modulation of the TGFβ1 pathway by
Gpnmb. For the remyelination studies, we will use the toxin induced models of demyelination. To define the
molecular mechanisms of the TGFβ1-Gpnmb signaling pathway, we will utilize in vitro neural stem cell cultures
from adult mouse brain. Together, these studies will help identify therapeutic targets for promoting remyelination."
10876916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT)
experience clinically significant negative sequelae affecting disease prognosis, survival, and
quality of life. These sequelae include increase in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
higher occurrences of neutropenic fever and higher symptom burden (e.g., depression, pain)
which are associated with circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). CRD involves disruption in
naturally occurring 24-hour cycles of hormone secretion, temperature and activity. CRD raises
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines unfolding a cascade of negative effects that include
higher symptom burden and risk of developing neutropenic fever. CRD has been associated
with poorer prognosis and survival. Our recently completed R21 study showed that morning
circadian-effective illumination of patients' hospital rooms resulted in significantly higher
nocturnal melatonin levels, reduced depression and production of inflammatory cytokines
compared to the circadian-ineffective group (control). In the active group, an improvement in
sleep and reduction in neutropenic fever was observed. Our R21 results also showed a strong
negative relationship between melatonin levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, for
the proposed multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) we hypothesize that circadian
entrainment resulting from morning light exposure will lead to better sleep, lower levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and symptom burden, as well as fewer occurrences of neutropenic
fever. We will investigate if circadian-effective illumination, of patients' hospital rooms/outpatient
settings during ASCT, promotes circadian entrainment and improves sleep, and if circadian
entrainment reduces inflammation. We will also investigate whether better entrainment and
lower levels of pro-inflammatory markers are associated with fewer occurrences of neutropenic
fever and reduced symptom burden. The circadian stimulating light will be installed in the
outpatient setting/hospital rooms since transplants are performed in both settings. A unique
advantage of our intervention is that it does not require any patient effort because the circadian-
active light is delivered throughout the entire room.
The project will determine if: 1) circadian-effective light compared to circadian-ineffective light,
delivered during ASCT results in circadian rhythm entrainment; 2) circadian entrainment
reduces pro-inflammation cytokines and mediates the effects of circadian-effective light on the
cytokines; and 3) reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with reduced
occurrence of neutropenic fever and lower symptom burden in patients."
10876917,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 emulates many aspects of inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases. Circulating autoantibodies have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients where they have an
antigen profile reminiscent of the lupus-associated thrombophilia known as antiphospholipid syndrome. While
the association between infection, critical illness, and the induction of autoantibodies has long been
recognized, pathogenesis and persistence of these antibodies—and most importantly the extent to which they
may be therapeutic targets—have not been well defined. This award will play a critical role in helping me
achieve my long-term career goals, which include: (1) Establishing a unique niche in the area of infection-
associated autoimmunity; (2) Becoming an independent investigator at a leading medical research institution;
and (3) Mentoring and fostering the development of trainees. These objectives will be reached by incorporating
both a strong mentorship environment and a formal instructional plan.
Mentorship Environment: I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Division of Rheumatology at the
University of Michigan with 75% of my effort protected for research. Over the past two years, I have received
strong training from Dr. Jason Knight in antiphospholipid syndrome pathogenesis. With this proposal, I am
seeking support for a new research endeavor, as I turn my attention to the thromboinflammatory
consequences of infection-associated autoimmunity. I have assembled a strong team of advisors, all experts in
their respective fields and carefully selected to compliment the proposed project and career development.
Formal Instruction: My scientific goals for this proposal include: (1) To expertly assess relevant measures of
thromboinflammation; (2) To effectively manipulate and characterize mouse models; and (3) To develop
laboratory skills in support of the study of autoantibodies and NETs in sepsis. Equally important are my career
development goals, which include: (1) To learn to write innovative proposals in support of ethically-conducted
research in humans and animals; (2) To enhance leadership, mentoring, and team-building skills; and (3) To
continue to improve my written and oral communication. These goals will be achieved through a combination of
mentorship, formal didactic instruction, and experimentation.
Research: I plan to use COVID-19 and other severe infections as a window into the origins of autoimmunity
and—in doing so—determine thromboinflammatory mechanisms of infection-associated autoantibodies. Aim 1
will elucidate the durability and clinical interactions of antiphospholipid antibodies and anti-NET antibodies in
patients hospitalized with either COVID-19 or non-COVID sepsis. Aim 2 will characterize pathogenic and
protective functions of infection-associated autoantibodies."

Recent pandemics of human pathogens have revealed the limitations of current surveillance systems. The
sequential arboviral epidemics in the Americas showed how outbreak detection can be delayed and opportunities
missed to collect well-characterized specimens and data for surveillance, basic science, clinical research, and
development of vaccines and new diagnostics. In response, we have assembled a consortium of world-renowned
investigators in arbovirology, epidemiology, immunology, viral diagnostics, phylogenetics, and clinical research,
while leveraging research infrastructure and expertise in long-term cohort and hospital-based studies. This has
resulted from 3 decades of collaborative international research, with over 200 joint publications, and extensive
experience in preparing for and responding to outbreaks working closely with local and international health
authorities and NIAID. With key sites in Asia and the Americas, we will use innovative molecular and serological
methods to identify emerging pathogens and to address fundamental questions in dengue and other arboviral
epidemiology and test viral, host and environmental determinants of differences between sites along a gradient
of urbanicity. Our overarching goal is to develop an interconnected, harmonized network of clinical and
laboratory sites to strengthen research programs, compare disease epidemiology and severity in
different regions, develop and implement cutting-edge diagnostic methods, and respond efficiently and
effectively to outbreaks. Standardized hospital studies and community-based cohorts in Ecuador, Nicaragua
and Sri Lanka will characterize and compare human arboviral illnesses across urban, peri-urban and rural sites
and develop sustainable infrastructure to rapidly respond to epidemics together with Ministries of Health, comple-
mented by outbreak investigation, surveillance of non-human primates, and vector incrimination. We will imple-
ment standardized plans for study administration, data and clinical management, and statistical analysis across
sites, supported by an extensive on-site training program. Aim 1 will establish standard and novel multiplex
assays at each site for surveillance, diagnosis and research of arboviruses and other pathogens. Aim 2 com-
pares dengue/arbovirus epidemiology and transmission in cohort studies located in ecologically distinct regions
over a continuum of urbanicity. In Aim 3, we will characterize complete viral genome sequences for comparative
studies of arboviral phylogenetics, phylogeography and molecular epidemiology. Aim 4 consists of surveillance,
identification, and characterization of novel and unrecognized human pathogens from severe hospitalized cases,
unexpected outbreaks, vectors and non-human primates. Molecular and serological assays will be developed
for newly identified pathogens and quickly implemented across study sites to characterize the epidemiology and
clinical manifestations and will be made available to the EIDRC network. In sum, our A2CARES Consortium will
provide valuable new tools and knowledge and 3 interconnected centers in Latin America and South Asia that
will be able to respond to outbreaks and to study emerging and endemic infectious diseases far into the future."
10877082,"Simulations based on patient-specific inputs have the potential to drive major advances in personalized
medicine. However, important gaps persist that must be addressed before simulation-based engineering can
be fully leveraged in the treatment of corneal and refractive disorders. These include development of clinical
tools for biomechanical characterization, integration of measurement and simulation systems, and model
validation and verification. In this Bioengineering Research Grant, we will address each of these challenges by
the following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop optical coherence elastography (OCE) for 3D characterization
of heterogenous corneal biomechanical properties. In this developmental aim, we will develop and
optimize a new system capable of 1) volumetric regional sampling; 2) true 3D displacement tracking and 3)
simultaneous IOP and viscoelastic property measurement. The system will be used to establish more sensitive
biomechanical biomarkers for keratoconus (KC) and to inform inverse FE models for 3D property estimation.
Aim 2. Integrate 3D OCE and inverse FE modeling to characterize and compare 3D corneal
biomechanical properties in normal, KC, and surgically altered states. Tomography and 3D OCE-derived
measurements will be used to establish and validate patient-specific FE models. We will conduct human
studies to test the hypothesis that OCE-derived biomarkers will better discriminate manifest KC and subclinical
KC from normal eyes than available tomography and air puff-derived biomechanical metrics. We will also
measure spatial biomechanical changes during a longitudinal study of KC progression and compare depth-
dependent biomechanical changes in LASIK, small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), and corneal
crosslinking (CXL). The latter comparison will directly test the widely promulgated hypothesis that SMILE
causes less stromal weakening than LASIK. Aim 3. Develop and evaluate patient-specific computational
models for predicting interventional outcomes, KC progression, and post-LASIK ectasia. We will test
the hypothesis that models populated with subject-specific geometry and material property data are more
accurate predictors of surgical outcomes metrics, KC progression rate, and post-LASIK ectasia risk than
existing methods. Successful completion of the aims is expected to lead to the development and immediate
translation of a personalized precision-medicine framework for leveraging such data for more effective
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning in key clinical conditions."
10877193,"Abstract
 The X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl CpG-binding protein 2) is associated with two major
neurodevelopmental disorders: Rett Syndrome (RTT), caused by loss-of-function mutations in MeCP2, and
MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS), caused by too much MeCP2. RTT is one of the most common genetic
causes of intellectual disability in females, while (MDS) is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in
males. Because the MeCP2 protein regulates the expression of thousands of genes across multiple brain
regions, the phenotype of each disease extends well beyond intellectual disability to affect mood, motor control,
and autonomic functions1. The brain is exquisitely sensitive to the quantity of MeCP2: a drop of just 16% in
MeCP2 levels is enough to produce Rett-like symptoms. This single fact is a salient challenge to the most
promising therapies being developed for these diseases: slightly over-shooting treatment for RTT by increasing
MeCP2 levels too much will cause MDS; suppressing MeCP2 levels too much in MDS will cause RTT. To avoid
simply exchanging one set of debilitating symptoms for another, we need reliable ways to measure treatment
responses and to assess whether we are administering the correct dose.
 Preclinical studies in humanized mice have convincingly demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides
(ASO) can reduce MeCP2 levels and reverse the MDS phenotype; more recent work identified kinases and
phosphatases that regulate MeCP2 stability, again with good results in mice. These options are both extremely
promising, but how do we measure MeCP2 levels in patients? MeCP2 is a nuclear, chromatin-bound protein
that is expressed at very high levels in the brain, where it is not accessible to direct measurement. We have
therefore been searching for other molecules that correlate with MeCP2 levels but are measurable in blood
samples or other relatively noninvasive means. I propose that, for such complex diseases as RTT and MDS, a
composite biomarker panel will be superior to any single-modality measure to judge treatment response. Our
preliminary studies have already identified two important molecular biomarkers that track with MeCP2 levels
in mice; we have several additional candidates as well. This study therefore aims to develop a panel of clinical
and molecular biomarkers that will guide therapeutic efforts to prevent over- or under-treatment in these
diseases. Texas Children's Hospital has the largest patient populations in the country for both RTT and MDS,
so we are well-positioned to accomplish 1) Develop outcome measures for MDS; 2) Correlate phenotypes with
the genomic structure at Xq28 locus; and 3) Validate in humans molecular biomarkers that track with changes
in MeCP2 levels in mice. Completing these three aims will lay the groundwork for clinical trials of ASOs in
MDS and pave the path forward for studies involving other allelic disorders involving too much or too little of
the same gene product."
10877195,"The proposed research investigates the risk of cognitive impairment, dementia and brain atrophy in relation to
physical activity, infection, biological sex, and APOE genotype. We propose to continue longitudinal research
with Tsimane and Moseten, two cohorts of Native South Americans whose lifestyle and environment require
high levels of physical activity and expose them to high pathogen burdens, most like the human preindustrial
past. Though infections are hypothesized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Dementias (ADRD), this is the first population-based study of ADRD in a highly infectious context,
where infection is considered as a primary contributor of risk. The current NIA project (1RF1AG054442) has
revealed: 1) very low prevalence of both coronary artery disease (CAD) and AD, with a shallower cross-
sectional age slope of brain atrophy than in European and US populations, but 2) a high prevalence of
intracranial medial arterial calcification (MAC) associated with cognitive impairment, and 3) an almost two-fold
higher risk of cognitive impairment in females. We propose the following hypotheses to explain these findings:
(H1) high levels of physical activity slow brain atrophy and reduce risk of AD, in part by reducing adiposity,
arteriosclerosis, and metabolically-induced inflammation;
(H2) viral and bacterial infections increase brain atrophy and ADRD risk, by (H2a) affecting amyloid production
and arterial disease, including pathways that affect amyloid and leukocyte trafficking across the blood brain
barrier. We further hypothesize that those impacts are reduced by (H2b) high physical activity and (H2c)
intestinal helminth infection, as helminths have anti-inflammatory and immuno-regulatory effects;
(H3) higher cognitive impairment risk in females is due to greater upregulated innate inflammatory responses
to pathogens (e.g. via increased amyloid and tau production) than in males;
(H4) In a food-limited high-pathogen environment, the APOE ε4 allele has sex-specific and interactive effects
with pathogen burden on immune responses, blood lipids and ADRD risk.
These hypotheses will be tested with a population-based, mixed longitudinal-panel and case-control design,
including two waves of cognitive assessments, family interviews, medical exams and biomarker collection, and
a wave of paired chest and brain computed tomography scans for assessment of longitudinal change in brain
volume and arteriosclerosis. Innovations include blood levels of amyloid and tau biomarkers, gene (mRNA)
expression, and within-individual comparisons pre- versus post COVID-19 illness. The new data collection
builds on a cohesive interdisciplinary leadership team to augment current cross-sectional findings with tests of
causal models of longitudinal change. These populations offer a vanishing opportunity to study how risk factors
operate in diverse environments, and assess the role of infection in AD and brain aging. The data collected will
also constitute a biobank for future research and access to data-sharing consortia."

10881426,"The role of Rok and its substrate Cmb the male germline
 Traditionally, Rho kinase (ROCK, Rok in flies) functions as effector of the non-canonical
Wnt/Frizzled PCP pathway during gastrulation and neural tube formation. It also affects epithelial
barrier formation and is required for cell migration and metastases formation. Unsurprisingly, both
the up- and downregulation of Rok activity can cause severe developmental defects. However, a
function for Rok in the male germline has never been addressed.
 Here, we have identified a novel function for Rok and its substrate Combover (Cmb) in the
male germline in Drosophila, where both are required for spermiogenesis and proper sperm
separation and packaging. Our proposal addresses the hypothesis that, downstream of Rok,
Combover orchestrates a novel transition checkpoint between axoneme elongation and sperm
individualization. In particular, our preliminary data suggest that Cmb coordinates the cytoskeleton
with the plasma membrane, thus ensuring proper growth and resolution of the syncytial
spermatids into functional sperm that are encapsulated by their own plasma membrane.
 Our identification of Rok and Cmb as critical components necessary for male gametogenesis
will have wide-ranging implications for sperm development beyond Drosophila: syncytial
mammalian spermatids have to individualize during spermiation, a process that, although different
in detail in mammals, nevertheless, as in flies, requires tight encapsulation of the sperm tail with
its membrane while shedding unnecessary cytoplasm. The biomedical significance of sperm
individualization is further exemplified by the presence of multiciliate spermatozoa and spermatids
with unresorbed cytoplasm in infertile men."
10881262,"The constriction and regression of brain capillaries is well documented in Alzheimer’s disease and Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (AD/VCID). There is strong preclinical and clinical evidence to suggest that contraction of pericytes leads to abnormal capillary constriction, and that this contributes to cerebral hypoperfusion in AD/VCID. However, rigorous approaches to incorporate pericyte-driven hypoperfusion into AD/VCID models remain limited. This R61/R33 project will develop a novel chemogenetic model for cerebral hypoperfusion that involves adjustable control of CNS capillary flow by engaging pericyte contractile dynamics. We demonstrate feasibility of the approach by expressing in CNS pericytes, Gq-DREADDs (Designer Receptors Activated Only by Designer Drugs), an engineered G protein-coupled receptor that can be selectively and potently activated by ligands with little to no other biological activity. Using this “lock and key” approach, we achieved effective chemogenetic control of pericyte contractility and modulation of brain capillary flow and tissue oxygen levels in vivo. However, some limitations need to be overcome for broader utility of the model. Crossing Atp13a5-2A-CreER-IRES- tdTomato mice with floxed Gq-DREADD mice led to inefficient gene recombination with routine tamoxifen dosing, and the need to cross-breed mice becomes a burden for combining the hypoperfusion model with other disease models. Therefore, this project will develop Pericyte DREADD knock-in mice to circumvent the need for Cre-lox recombination. In the R61 phase, Pericyte Gq-DREADD mice will be created for chemogenetic contraction of brain pericytes in vivo. We will determine optimal dosing for systemic administration of DREADD agonist to achieve chronic blood flow reduction to ~50-75% of basal levels in adult and aged mice. Microvascular perfusion in gray and white matter will be assessed with longitudinal deep two-photon imaging and followed by detailed histology for hypoxic tissue damage and neuroinflammation. Conversely, Pericyte Gs-DREADD mice will be generated to relax CNS pericytes and dilation capillaries through chemogenetic inhibition. This tool can be used to rescue capillary perfusion in disease models where abnormal pericyte contraction has been implicated. If these initial studies are successful, the R33 phase will characterize the Pericyte Gq-DREADD hypoperfusion model by performing a battery of sensorimotor and cognitive tests. Longitudinal high-field MRI for cerebral blood flow and white matter integrity will be conducted. Single cell transcriptomic analysis will be used to map transcriptomic changes resulting from acute and chronic hypoperfusion. Finally, the new mice will be bred with established genetic models of amyloid β over-expression (TgSwDi) to test the hypothesis that capillary hypoperfusion worsens amyloid β deposition and augments pathology. Pericyte Gs-DREADDs will be crossed with TgSwDi mice to determine if age-related cerebral blood flow deficits can be ameliorated. After characterization, Pericyte Gq-DREADD and Gs-DREADD mice will be independently tested by collaborating laboratories and shared through the Jackson Laboratory and MODEL-AD centers."
10881444,"Candida albicans, the primary causative agent of fungal vaginitis, will affect 75% of all women of reproductive
age at least once in their lifetime. Long believed to result from immunodeficiency, a growing body of evidence
strongly suggests that vaginitis is now considered to be an immunopathology, in which the host response
actually drives disease symptoms. Lack of a comprehensive understanding of the host and fungal factors that
initiate symptomatic disease remains a significant barrier to progress in better treating and managing this most
prevalent human fungal infection. Guided by strong published and preliminary data, we have identified that the
fungal peptide toxin candidalysin is the major virulence determinant driving vaginitis pathogenesis and that
amino acid variation of this effector exists amongst C. albicans clinical isolates that impacts pathogenicity.
Therefore, the objectives of this proposal are to determine the capacity to which novel candidalysin variants
can drive IL-1 signaling during vaginitis and whether vaccination strategies and novel thiobenzoate chemical
scaffolds can block both fungal growth and/or inflammation to better resolve disease symptoms. Under the first
aim, we will determine if novel amino acid candidalysin variants observed in clinical isolates impact
pathogenicity or competitive fitness in vivo. We will also determine structure-function activity of the entire
candidalysin coding sequence by performing alanine scanning to identify non-toxic vaccine candidates that my
limit immunopathology following immunization. The second aim will focus on delineating redundant and unique
contributions of IL-1 isoforms in controlling fungal burden and driving inflammation at the vaginal mucosa and
which cell types produce IL-1 during vaginal infection. We will use a series of constitutive and conditional
knockouts to further probe which cell types respond to and govern IL-1-dependent phenotypes. The third aim
seeks to validate previously and newly identified small molecules that possess both anti-inflammatory and
antifungal activity using an established pipeline from in silico molecular docking to functional validation. The
outcomes of this project will provide foundational information regarding function of novel candidalysin isoform
variants, candidalysin-dependent IL-1 responses during vaginitis, and identify promising new chemical
scaffolds to impede IL-1 signaling that may be exploited for improved clinical management of vaginitis."
10882601,"Project Summary/Abstract
We and others showed that ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), a mitochondrial flavoprotein, is induced by
DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner and regulates apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species.
As the only human ferredoxin reductase, FDXR receives two electrons from NADPH and transfers them
one at a time to its cognate substrates ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and FDX2 and subsequently, plays a role in
biogenesis of steroids and iron sulfur cluster proteins. Despite these well-defined biochemical
functions, the role of FDXR in tumor suppression is still poorly understood. Interestingly, recent studies
showed that FDXR is the most consistent acute sensor following DNA damage, suggesting that FDXR
plays a role in DNA damage response and repair. Indeed, our pilot studies showed that FDXR is also
expressed in the nucleus and regulates cell growth and survival potentially via its nuclear substrates
(p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4) in response to a stress. These observations prompt us to hypothesize that the
nuclear FDXR has a critical biological function in tumor suppression. To further test this, two specific
aims are proposed: (1) To determine how FDXR subcellular localization is regulated; (2) To determine
how the nuclear FDXR exerts its biological function."

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including storage, voiding, urinary incontinence symptoms and pain,
and their associated diagnoses are common, costly, and negatively impact women's quality of life throughout
the life course. Despite their common occurrence and high cost, little research to date has focused on
identification of risk and protective factors for LUTS and prevention, and even less has focused on promotion
and maintenance of bladder health. To address this gap, the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
(PLUS) Research Consortium (of which our site is a founding Clinical Research Center) was established to
develop the scientific foundation for future evidence-based bladder health promotion and LUTS prevention
interventions in adolescent and adult women. In this application, we propose to build upon foundational work
conducted in PLUS 1 to further this scientific foundation. Specifically, we propose to establish a large,
longitudinal, national, population-based, observational cohort study (currently under development and co-led
by the Washington University School of Medicine site PI) designed to: a) determine the distribution of and
changes in bladder health over time in the general female population; and b) identify new risk and protective
factors for LUTS and bladder health amenable to intervention. Per the FOA, we have selected one important
risk/protective factor research question for incorporation into the population-based cohort study: does chronic
delayed voiding, a common behavior among women across the life course that can be addressed by
preventive interventions at multiple levels of social ecology, contribute to bladder health deterioration
and the development of LUTS? Guided by an intervention mapping approach and community partner insight,
we will build the evidence base for this research question by conducting a series of innovative, multi-method,
transdiciplinary studies nested within the population-based cohort study, as well as complementary to this
study. Together, this comprehensive set of quantitative and qualitative studies will provide: 1) critical new data
to address the causal nature of associations between chronic delayed voiding and bladder health/LUTS (i.e.,
high-quality, prospective epidemiologic data devoid of temporal biases and supportive biologic, mechanistic
data); 2) new findings to inform the optimal focus and mode of delivery of future prevention interventions (i.e.,
multi-method data on the strongest individual-behavioral, interpersonal, institutional, and community/societal
determinants of chronic delayed voiding, the most effective mode of delivery of educational interventions
[assuming that future interventions will include an educational component], and initial promising educational
messages); and 3) new tools to evaluate future interventions. As such, this complementary set of studies
holds the promise to greatly expand the foundation of knowledge for future bladder health promotion
and LUTS prevention interventions."

CAR T cells can mediate deep, durable cancer remissions but their activity is not controllable once infused, they
are not easily tracked, their risk for toxicity remains an issue, and they are seldom designed to combat the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To provide a means for quantitative control of CAR T cell
activity, our team first created universal immune receptors (UniCARs), a versatile CAR-like platform for the de
novo generation and quantitative control of tumor antigen-specific T cells where human T cells are genetically
engineered with adaptable docking immune receptors and can be conferred with highly personalized tumor
specificity via pre-targeting with “tagged” antigen-specific small molecules, antibodies, scFvs or receptor ligands.
Building upon these principles, and with a multidisciplinary team of physicians and researchers with scientific
expertise in advanced T cell gene-engineering with molecular imaging and chemistry, we propose clinical
development of an orthogonal imaging-enabled, adaptable CAR T cell (ImAC) platform where localization of
infused UniCAR T cells can monitored via noninvasive PET imaging and UniCAR activity can be controlled
through the administration of “tagged” biologics in order to facilitate safe and effective targeted therapy for
cancer. This theranostic ImAC method utilizes a single UniCAR construct with two novel and distinct agents that
share the same clinically-validated CAR-binding tag (DOTA); an imaging small molecule, [18F]-DOTA-Y, that
permits tracking of the cellular product, and a new targeting biologic, folate-DOTA-Y, that redirects the specificity
and activity of UniCAR T cells against folate receptor expressing cells. Folate receptor isoforms are expressed
by the majority of ovarian cancers and by most immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in
the TME, allowing simultaneous targeting of cancer and TAMs via dosing with a single agent. An additional
benefit, beyond the immediate scope of this study, is that targeting biologics can also be applied for diagnostic
imaging prior to CAR T cell delivery to assess localization of the agent to the tumor, to predict response to
therapy, and to test for potential on-target off-tumor toxicity. In the UG3 phase, the goal of our multidisciplinary
team is to refine and optimize the ImAC method to validated optimal dosing schedules, routes and concentrations
that confer a strong tumor response, and to confirm small molecule-based imaging of the administered CAR T
cells in mouse xenograft models of ovarian cancer. With this data in hand, and with the small molecule targeting
biologic being generated by the Immune Cell Network Core (ICN), we will seek to conduct a 3+3 dose-escalation
phase I clinical trial of administration of autologous UniCAR T cells with folate-DOTA-Y for recurrent high grade
serous ovarian cancer with PET-based imaging of the infused cell product in the UH3 phase of the study.
Successful clinical development of this ImAC platform will significantly advance CAR gene therapy by allowing
for the therapeutic coupling of adaptable antigen-targeted T cells with PET-guided monitoring for therapeutic
activity, drug delivery and safety in vivo, which can be readily re-deployed for the treatment of other malignancies."
10880853,"ABSTRACT
The recent development of T cell-based cancer immunotherapies, including checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1,
anti-CTLA-4 and others) or adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) using modified patient T cells, has led to improved
patient outcomes for a variety of cancers. However, durable responses are observed in only a fraction of patients.
Further progress can be made by studying and targeting different T cell signaling pathways, such as the T cell
receptor (TCR)-CD3 signaling pathway. T cell recognition of antigen by the TCR and the resulting proximal
signaling through surrounding CD3 subunits are key steps in the initiation of tumor-killing. Previous studies that
targeted the antigen binding site of the TCR for enhancing T cell responses to tumor antigens often lead to off-
target effects and toxicity. Instead, identification of the specific extracellular interactions between the TCR and
CD3 subunits could offer precise guidance for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate
T cell immunity by targeting signaling through the TCR-CD3 complex without altering antigen-specificity. Our
preliminary data showed that mutating residues in the constant domain of the TCR resulted in altered T cell
cytokine responses. Based on our preliminary data, our hypothesis is that by modulating TCR-CD3 signaling,
immune-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor antigens can be enhanced without losing specificity for the cancer
antigen. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will use an in vitro retroviral TCR display method, a novel CD3-
tetramer assay, and an in-silico structure-based TCR design approach to identify signal-enhancing TCR mutants
that enable T cells to mediate more effective in vitro tumor killing. In Aim 2, we will identify the mechanisms that
drive altered signaling evidenced in select TCR signal-enhancing and signal-hampering mutants. In Aim 3,
identified mutations will be introduced into gp100-specific TCRs with different antigen affinities and their in vitro
and in vivo tumor killing efficacy will be analyzed to characterize the tumor killing potential, T cell differentiation,
and T cell exhaustion patterns of new signal-enhancing T cell clones with the goal of developing a new strategy
for effective T cell therapies against cancer."
10882502,"ABSTRACT:
Almost two billion people worldwide become ill with diarrhea annually, and ~700,000 die. Nontyphoidal
Salmonella, such as Typhimurium, cause roughly 180 million diarrheal illnesses and 300,000 of all diarrheal
disease-associated deaths. Very young and very old people, as well as immunosuppressed individuals coinfected
with HIV or plasmodium, are particularly at risk of suffering life-threatening, systemic nontyphoidal Salmonella
infections. During infection, phagocytic cells bombard Salmonella with highly toxic reactive oxygen species
produced in the respiratory burst of the protein complex NOX2. The metabolic adaptations that promote growth of
Salmonella in macrophages are vital yet largely neglected facets in the pathogenesis of this intracellular bacterium.
In the current grant period, we made a series of crucial new observations regarding the hitherto poorly understood
terminal electron acceptors used by intracellular Salmonella to resist NOX2 killing. (a) Salmonella exploit
anaerobic respiration in order to avoid metabolic pathways particularly sensitive to reactive oxygen species
synthesized by NOX2. (b) The O2-consuming activity of phagocytic cells activates Salmonella anaerobic programs
in mice, macrophages and hypoxic culture conditions that recapitulate microabscesses developing during
Salmonella systemic infections. (c) Anaerobic respiration associated with dmsABC gene products is required for
survival of Salmonella in phagocytes and mice. (d) We have identified methionine sulfoxide, a byproduct of NOX2
enzymatic activity in mice, as the relevant terminal electron acceptor utilize by dmsABC gene products. (e)
Anaerobic respiration on methionine sulfoxide is associated with production of the antioxidant hydrogen sulfide
(H2S) in anaerobic Salmonella undergoing oxidative stress. (f) Intracellular Salmonella also respires on the sulfur
compound tetrathionate to avoid NOX2 killing in macrophages, while activating the expression of Salmonella
virulence programs. Cumulatively, our data support the hypothesis that intracellular Salmonella has coopted the
energetics and signaling pathways arising from a sulfur-centric anaerobic metabolism to counteract the damaging
activity of NOX2 enzymatic complexes in macrophages. Aim 1 will investigate the contribution of DmsA-dependent
anaerobic respiration to the resistance of intracellular Salmonella to NOX2. Aim 2 will evaluate the degree to which
hydrogen sulfide aids the defense of intracellular Salmonella against oxidative stress. Aim 3 will identify the
mechanisms through which tetrathionate respiration fosters the antioxidant defenses of intracellular Salmonella.
The knowledge generated in the course of these investigations will not only illuminate key aspects of Salmonella
pathogenesis but will also identify key terminal electron acceptors utilized by intracellular Salmonella to establish
a stronghold within professional macrophages."
10884526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advent of singe-cell genomics has enhanced our ability to study heterogeneous cell populations (1) to track the
time course of cellular differentiation and identify drivers, (2) to identify potentially novel cell states/types in an
unsupervised manner, and (3) to identify cell populations that are linked disease outcomes. More recently, we
and others have developed single-cell multiomics technologies that enable measuring of multiple modalities of
a single cell at the same time, including the transcriptome, the methylome, the epigenome and surface marker
proteins. These assays offer unprecedented opportunities to study the state of single cells more
comprehensively; by developing the necessary computational methods for these assays, we can obtain more
accurate and deeper characterization of cell states and obtain mechanistic insights into the relationships
between state of chromatin, the proteome and the transcriptomic states within an individual cell. However,
there is a dramatic lack of interpretable computational methods to study multiomics data. To address this gap
and propel the field forward, we are proposing to develop computational methodologies that will (1)
characterize the state of a single cell in a multiomic setting in an unsupervised manner, (2) characterize the
regulatory landscape of single-cells by identifying transcription factor binding activity and (3) identify multiple
structural variations at single-cells.
First, we will develop interpretable topic-modeling based methods for characterizing single cells based on
multiomic readout. Building on our past success with topic models to accurately cluster and characterize
single-cell populations, we will develop novel topic modeling approaches for multiomics assays in order to
achieve a much deeper profiling of the state of a cell, which will lead to potential insights into the links between
multiple modalities measured by a multiomic assay, such as transcriptomic and epigenomic state. Second, we
propose to develop a single-cell transcription factor footprinting (TF) methods. Computational detection of TF
footprints can identify the landscape of active transcription factors that determine important drivers of cell state
and identity. We will develop the methodology to identify active transcription factors at an unprecedented
single-cell resolution and to investigate links between the methylome and TF binding. Lastly, we will develop
methods to identify different types of structural variations at single cell resolution by leveraging novel multiomic
assays developed by my collaborators. This methodology will enhance our ability to study the heterogeneity of
structural variations in different cell populations. Overall, the proposed suite of computational methodologies
will allow a broad audience of researchers who generate and analyze multiomic data to annotate the multi-
modally measured cell states in heterogeneous cell populations in a deep and unprecedented manner at
single-cell resolution. Furthermore, our interpretable methods will yield testable hypotheses to better
understand the cell state."

Economically disadvantaged, racially-diverse youth lag their peers for science achievement by third grade.
Historic divestment in their communities may have already paved their path to poor adult health, fewer
employment opportunities, and lower economic mobility. LEARN Science – Library Efforts to Advance Reading
and Nutrition Science – blazes a new trail for youth using informal science education (ISE) through community
public libraries across Mississippi (MS). LEARN Science is a life science and reading program through a
nutrition science lens to improve science achievement among children in kindergarten through 2nd grade (K-2).
MS is characterized by educational and health disparities, yet it boasts a robust public library system. Public
libraries are potential: 1) bridges to improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
inequities; and 2) key collaborators for health education and promotion. The role of food for survival is a
foundational scientific concept for children to learn in K-2. Food exposes youth to potentially dozens of
scientific concepts daily, as well as to cultural traditions and health principles. As such, nutrition education can
empower youth to make food choices for chronic disease prevention. Our overall long-term goal is to establish
LEARN Science to improve science achievement among children in K-2. The program will be aligned with Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and be consistent with the social ecological model. LEARN Science
will consist of seven lesson units. Each unit will follow a storyline and blend two culturally- and age-appropriate
books with: 1) nutrition science terminology; 2) inquiry-based, hands-on activities using science tools; 4)
scientific observations and reflection; and 4) take-home family learning resources. Unit readings will include
both: 1) a narrative (fiction) book with a nutrition component; and 2) an informational (nonfiction) book
showcasing a scientist and/or a scientific principle. Units will include a mentor guide and information on
connecting families with community food resources. We will: 1) develop and evaluate the LEARN Science
program, utilizing latest educational best practices; 2) establish the NIH SEPA Library Academy, a professional
development program (PDP) focused on mentoring and building self-efficacy among library staff to deliver
LEARN Science across MS; and 3) disseminate LEARN Science across the MS public libraries. LEARN
Science will strengthen ISE opportunities for children in K-2, improve science achievement of children, and
ultimately has the potential to expand the number of children choosing STEM careers."

10887547,"PROJECT 2 | PROJECT SUMMARY
Failure to separate the fetal foregut into distinct trachea and esophagus (TE) can result in a spectrum of life-
threatening tracheoesophageal defects (TEDs). The genetic etiology of TEDs is poorly understood, and risk
variants are known in only 12% of TED patients. Even in cases where the causative mutations are known such
as in developmental transcription factors (TFs), how they result in TEDs is unclear because up until recently the
mechanisms of TE morphogenesis were ill defined. We made significant progress in the previous award. Using
a combination of Xenopus and mouse embryology, we elucidated the conserved cellular events driving TE
morphogenesis and showed that disrupting any step can result in TED-like phenotypes. We used Xenopus
CRISPR screens to validate potential TED-causing variants from patient genome sequences. One major
discovery was that downstream of Hedgehog (HH) signaling and developmental TFs, endosome-mediated
membrane remodeling is required to separate the foregut into distinct TE tubes. Consistent with this, genome
sequencing of 185 TED patients from Project 1 revealed an enrichment of damaging variants in
membrane/vesicular trafficking genes including the endocytic adaptor ITSN1, which in preliminary data we
demonstrated is required for Xenopus TE morphogenesis. The goal of the CLEAR consortium Project 2 is to
define the developmental basis of TED with cellular resolution in animal models. We will: Determine the
mechanism by which endosome trafficking regulates TE morphogenesis (Aim1). Test the hypothesis that
developmental TFs control the cell-specific expression of effector proteins such as endosome trafficking
machinery or cargo (Aim2, in collaboration with Project 3). Assess the pathogenicity of patient variants in animals
testing the provocative hypothesis that endosomeopathies might be a major cause of TEDs (Aim3)."
10887548,"PROJECT 3 | SUMMARY: MODELING EA IN HUMAN PSC-DERIVED EMBRYONIC TISSUES
The esophagus is composed of a layer of stratified epithelium that is surrounded by layers of innervated muscle
that regulates the unidirectional movement of food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal atresia (EA) with
or without associated tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is the most common Tracheoesophageal birth defect
(TED), yet most mutations causing EA are unidentified. This proposal aims to use human pluripotent stem cell
(PSC)-derived esophageal tissues both to understand EA and as a future source for reconstruction. We
developed human esophageal organoids (HEOs) and esophageal organotypic rafts (HEORs) with stratified
esophageal epithelium that is highly similar to human esophagus. We used these to investigate how SOX2, an
HMG-box transcription factor that is essential for esophageal development in mice, might cause EA in humans.
Transcriptional profiling of organoids at different stages of differentiation that are analogous to critical stages of
esophageal development identified that SOX2 regulates expression of Wnt antagonists like SFRP2 in the dorsal
foregut endoderm that gives rise to the esophagus. Loss of SOX2 expression resulted in loss of esophageal fate
and impaired morphogenesis, resulting in EA.
 In humans, patients with EA can have persistent motility defects suggesting that EA-associated genes
may affect development of the smooth muscles or the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the esophagus. Project
1 has identified new TED-associated mutations that we predict may act in specific germ layers to cause EA.
Published and preliminary data indicate that the transcription factors RFX6 and SOX2 act in the epithelium
whereas FOXF1 and SMAD6 act in the mesenchyme. Since esophageal organoids only contained epithelium,
they were not useful to study mutations impacting mesenchyme or ENS. We therefore engineered several new
organoid systems containing mesenchymal and ENS cell types all derived from PSCs. We propose to use these
novel human esophageal systems to test the hypothesis that EA-associated genes impact different germ layer
components and can cause later developmental and functional deficits in the esophagus.
 Here we propose using PSC-derived HEOs and HEORs that contain all three germ layers to identify how
EA-causing mutations impact epithelial, mesenchymal and ENS development. We will then determine how EA-
causing mutations impact the function of human engineered esophageal tissue. Lastly we will use EA-causing
mutations to identify epithelial- and mesenchyme-specific transcriptional programs in the developing human
esophagus."

10886214,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis causes profound changes in host metabolism, including acute and persistent muscle loss.
Among critically ill patients, body composition (including lean muscle mass) predicts mortality, length of stay,
and functional status, and patients with sepsis experience dramatic changes in body composition. Survivors of
sepsis commonly face profound functional deficits due to acute and persistent muscle catabolism.
Our research group has recently discovered that in murine models of sepsis, the gut microbiome
participates in the pathogenesis of acute muscle loss. Using murine models of sepsis, we have discovered
that variation in gut microbiota (e.g., enrichment with butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae spp.) explains
variation in acute muscle loss. Modulation of gut microbiota can attenuate acute muscle loss. These novel
findings suggest that the gut microbiome is an potential therapeutic target for sepsis-induced muscle loss. Yet
no study has investigated whether gut microbiota contribute to acute muscle loss in a human sepsis cohort.
Our central hypothesis is that specific gut bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae spp.) calibrate the body’s metabolic
response in sepsis, both propelling and impeding acute muscle loss. The rationale is that these discoveries will
facilitate development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of muscle loss in sepsis.
 Specific Aim 1: To determine the interaction between gut microbiota and body composition in
predicting clinical outcomes among septic patients. We hypothesize that core microbiome and
morphometric predictors of 28-day outcomes are not independent, but instead have a significant interaction,
supporting a causal relationship between the gut microbiome, body composition, and clinical trajectories.
We will test this hypothesis using a retrospective cohort of 800 hospitalized patients with sepsis. We will
characterize baseline gut microbiota (via 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing of admission rectal swabs),
body composition (using morphomic analysis of CT scans performed within 48 hours of microbiome
sampling), and 28-day clinical outcomes (using validated techniques of EMR interrogation). We will account
for key confounding exposures (e.g., antibiotics and corticosteroids) using our rich clinical data capture.
Specific Aim 2: To identify and interrogate the gut microbiota that predict acute muscle loss in
patients with sepsis. We hypothesize that core features of baseline (admission) gut microbiota predict
degree of muscle loss in septic patients. We will test this hypothesis using a subgroup of 300 patients in Aim
1 who had two CT scans performed more than 72 hours apart during the same hospitalization. We will use
validated morphometric indices to test the hypothesis that baseline gut microbiota predict change in body
composition (e.g., loss of lean muscle mass). We will perform metagenomic sequencing and in silico
metabolic inference to identify candidate microbial and metabolic pathways by which gut microbiota
contribute to sepsis-induced muscle loss."

10888142,"Abstract
The growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease coupled with a dearth of effective treatment options
necessitates the development of novel treatment approaches for Alzheimer’s Disease, particularly
those that pose minimal risk of adverse effects in a medically fragile population. Minimal risk, non-
invasive neuromodulatory therapies, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), may relieve
symptoms and enhance function in older adults with diverse conditions. We developed an at home
tDCS and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, and in a pilot study conducted in patients with
early Alzheimer’s disease, at home tDCS improved cognitive performance as well as stability in brain
metabolism.
We now propose to build and expand on the pilot study to test the clinical efficacy of home based tDCS
using a rigorous double blind randomized clinical trial design in 100 patients with mild to moderate
Alzheimer’s disease who will be randomized to receive either tDCS five days per week for six months
at home or to sham treatment at the same frequency. All participants will receive cognitive assessments
at baseline, post-intervention, and at one month and three months after intervention to explore and
document durability of effects. Our primary outcome is change in cognitive performance (assessed by
the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale test). Secondary outcomes include
measures of mood, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with both the device and procedure.
Neuroimaging markers of potential neuroplasticity will also be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention,
and at three months post-intervention.
We predict that the active tDCS will result in better cognitive performance, and higher quality of life, as
compared to sham, and will be a satisfactory treatment approach for patients and their families. We
also hypothesize that the clinical response produced by active tDCS will be associated with improved
functional and structural connectivity and use of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and associated
networks (e.g. executive control/salience networks).
The proposed study is highly responsive to PAR-19-298, which solicits applications to establish initial
efficacy of neurostimulation/neuromodulation in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementia. Our proposed clinical trial will provide high-quality evidence about the efficacy of at-home
tDCS in the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. If efficacy is demonstrated, this non-invasive, non-
pharmacologic intervention may become an important part of dementia care."
10888143,"DNA methylation, 3D genome organization and gene expression during Trichomonas vaginalis: host
interaction
ABSTRACT
Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite that colonizes the human urogenital tract
causing infections that range from asymptomatic to highly inflammatory. Chronic infections can lead to
severe complications such as infertility, premature birth during pregnancy, increases the risk of acquiring
HIV, cervical cancer and aggressive prostate cancer. Hence, understanding how the process of infection in
Trichomonas parasite is regulated remains an important goal in parasitology research and human health.
Host: parasite interaction is regulated by changes in gene expression, but it is still largely unknown how
these changes in transcriptional profiles are controlled as very few transcriptional regulatory elements have
been described. Our recent works highlighted the importance of epigenetics in the regulation of
transcription and possible role in parasite pathogenesis. Specifically, we analyzed the abundance of DNA
methylation demonstrating that N6-methyladenine (6mA), and not 5‐methylcytosine (5mC), is the main DNA
methylation mark in T. vaginalis. Genome-wide distribution of 6mA reveals that this mark is enriched at
intergenic regions, with a preference for certain superfamilies of DNA transposable elements. Interestingly,
bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of transcriptionally active or repressive intervals flanked by
6mA-enriched regions and results from chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments suggest these
6mA flanked regions are in close spatial proximity. This finding revealed a new role for 6mA in modulating
3D chromatin structure and gene expression in this parasite. Based on these antecedents we now propose
that 6mA could be a key regulator of 3D genome architecture by modulating expression of transcriptional-
modules of genes during parasite infection. Three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in the nucleus are
increasingly seen as key contributors to the regulation of gene expression but studies on how genome
structure and nuclear organization influence transcription have so far been limited to a handful of model
species. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to further analyze the
role of 6mA in the regulation of 3D genome conformation and gene expression during the process of
parasite attachment to host cells. These results will provide new insights into T. vaginalis epigenetic
regulation that may help to understand the mechanisms that lead to parasite adherence and cytotoxicity;
key steps toward dissecting the specific outcomes of Trichomonas infection. Importantly, the association of
6mA with chromatin looping is noteworthy because it points to a novel function for this epigenetic mark in
eukaryotes with scarce 5mC levels.

Willi L. Tarver is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, College of Medicine at
The Ohio State University. Dr. Tarver is responding to PAR-21-295 to obtain the skills, knowledge and mentored
research experience that are essential for a career as a research scientist focusing on cancer health informatics
and health disparities research. His long-term goal is to build an independent program of research that utilizes
health information technologies to improve cancer care and cancer health equity. The short-term goals for the
award period include: 1) gaining formal training in psychometrics and practical experience with Patient-Reported
Outcomes (PROs) and their assessment in the cancer context, 2) expanding knowledge and skills of Qualitative
and Mixed Methods Research Approaches; 3) gaining formal training in health disparities research, with a focus
on approaches to cancer health disparities studies; and 4) developing leadership skills training for research
scientists, including training in manuscript writing and grantsmanship toward building a presence in his respective
field. Blacks or African-Americans experience a greater cancer burden and poorer health outcomes, and face
more negative social determinants of health (SDH) (e.g., lower socioeconomic status, more barriers to care, etc)
than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. PROs provide additional prognostic information that may lead to
more patient-centered care, improved patient-provider communication, and better clinical outcomes such as
survival. However, studies have shown that Black cancer patients are less likely to complete PROs and more
likely to report difficulty in understanding the wording of PRO questions. Furthermore, adequately assessing
PROs in this population may require the collection of data beyond standard clinical measures, such as SDH.
This proposal is aimed at improving the assessment of patient-reported outcomes among Black cancer patients.
I will conduct qualitative interviews with Black cancer patients to understand the concerns and barriers to (e.g.,
computer literacy, security concerns, etc.) and facilitators of (e.g., education or other assistance) completing
PROs and SDH items. I will also conduct qualitative interviews with cancer care providers to understand their
barriers to and facilitators of the collection of PROs and information about SDH, their information needs, and
their preferences for assessing and using PROs and SDH in providing care for their cancer patients. The
knowledge derived from the interviews of patients and providers will inform the development, refinement, and
implementation of a PRO/SDH tool tailored to the needs and preferences of Black patients and their cancer care
providers. The resulting PRO/SDH tool and delivery approach will undergo feasibility testing and will be adapted
in a manner supportive of provider workflow. The research accomplished during this award period will lay the
foundation for a randomized trial to test the effects of providing cancer care providers with PRO/SDH data on
provision of care and clinical decision-making and examining whether changes in medical treatment and care
are indicated."
10887269,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in older adults age 65+ are a substantial and rapidly growing clinical problem.
About 40% of older adults are current drinkers, 5.6 million have recently engaged in binge drinking and 1.2
million have a diagnosable AUD. This has been characterized as a “silent epidemic” because AUDs in older
adults are vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated in health care. This problem will likely broaden as the
number of older adults is expected to increase from 54 million in 2019 to 77 million by 2034. Inadequate access
to care for AUD may be a key reason for undertreatment. This is particularly relevant for older adults enrolled
in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, who are subject to rules set by insurers regarding care utilization. These
rules include restrictions to receiving care from providers within plan networks. There is a substantial gap in
rigorous evidence characterizing the accessibility of providers of AUD care within MA plan networks, and
quantifying the effect of inadequate access on older adults' utilization of AUD care. These insights support the
long-term goal of our research, which is to guide payers and health systems increase the uptake of care for AUD
through rigorous evidence on the effects of provider networks and other managed care approaches. To advance
these goals, this R21 project will examine quantify and examine the effects of access to AUD care among older
adults enrolled in MA and will accomplish the following three specific aims: 1) describe geographical variation
in diagnosis of AUD and unmet treatment need among older adults, 2) descriptively characterize access to
providers of services for AUD among older adults, and 3) estimate the relationship between access to care and
use of care for AUD. Research in all aims will be conducted using extensive Medicare administrative and claims
data, which tracks enrollment in MA and the health service use of Medicare beneficiaries nationally. In Aim 1,
geographical variation in AUD diagnosis will be quantified using spatial mixed effects regression models.
Exploratory analyses in Aim 2 will quantify access to providers of AUD care across several measures by
utilizing comprehensive data on provider networks made available through the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation. Multivariable regression models will be applied to identify individual and local area factors
associated with greater access to care. In Aim 3, econometric models for health care utilization will be applied
to quantify the relationship between use of AUD care and access measures generated in Aim 2. Products from
this study will provide timely data-driven insights for health care stakeholders responsible for ensuring
individuals' ability to access care for AUD meets adequate standards. Also, insights identifying the dimensions
of access to care that most strongly influence utilization will help stakeholders prioritize approaches to increase
uptake of care for AUD. Finally, the current project will generate preliminary data for more complex studies
that examine the effects of other managed care approaches that may hinger uptake of care for AUD using
rigorous methods for causal inference using observational data."
10887270,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the US, at a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. One of the
hallmarks of this cancer are the driver mutations, which include KRAS and p53 mutations. Mutations of p53, a
tumor suppressor, causes the tumor to become more invasive and chemoresistant. Moreover, a major
contributor of morbidity of pancreatic cancer patients, is cachexia, which is defined as an involuntary loss in
muscle and fat deposits. Cachexia is a devastating syndrome which affects about 80% of pancreatic cancer
patients and increases mortality and decreases quality of life. Most cachectic patients don’t qualify for
chemotherapy and if they do, they are refractory to them. Currently, cachexia is treated in the clinic with nutritional
supplements and appetite stimulants. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies for cachexia yet. Our
preliminary data implicated Perp, to be a potential target in the tumor and muscles in PDAC. We utilized age-
appropriate murine models of cancer and cachexia and observed Perp, a known p53 target gene, to be increased
in PDAC tumors. Further, we observed that inhibition of Perp decreased tumor proliferation/burden. Expression
of Perp demonstrated to be negatively correlated to patient survival. Moreover, patients with mutant p53, also
had an increased expression of Perp as compared to patients with wildtype p53.Inhibition of Perp in p53 mutant
tumors increased downstream p53 signaling targets, implying possible activation of p53-associated pathways.
Furthermore, we also observed increased expression of Perp in cachectic muscles, which decreased upon
preventing muscle loss. Subsequently, we also demonstrated increased expression of Perp to be an early event
in cancer conditioned-media mediated myotube atrophy. In this study, we will investigate the differential role of
Perp in tumor progression and chemoresistance in mutant p53 compared to wildtype p53 tumors. Next, we will
utilize genetic tools and murine models to target Perp in the muscles in vivo. The overarching goals of the first
two aims are to establish Perp as an efficient target in the tumor and muscle. In silico modeling of Perp provided
a list of compounds with binding affinities to two predicted binding sites of Perp. We shortlisted compounds which
were successful in decreasing tumor burden and rescuing muscle atrophy in vitro. In the third aim, we will further
characterize/modify these molecules for specificity, toxicity and stability and test them in preclinical models of
PDAC and cachexia. Development of novel therapies which have the potential to decrease tumor burden and
rescue muscle wasting will be beneficial in improving patient survival, chemotherapy tolerance and quality of life."
10887323,"Project Abstract/Summary
Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) is a major public health problem especially postpartum. Postpartum
hypertension (HTN) accounts for nearly 75% of maternal hemorrhagic strokes, heart failures, and deaths, one-
third of which occurs in the first week after birth. Patients who survive these devastating complications face a
lifelong sequela of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mechanisms behind the increased risk of CVD involve
vascular dysfunction generated by HDP and further exacerbated by postpartum HTN. The postpartum period is
a time of high vascular remodeling following pregnancy, and even more so following a hypertensive pregnancy.
Patients who had HDP have lower flow mediated dilation (FMD) and higher arterial stiffness measured by pulse
wave velocity (PWV) compared to patients with no HDP. They also have higher levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine
kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an anti-angiogenic protein that causes vasoconstriction and endothelial damage. Our
preliminary studies demonstrate that intensive blood pressure (BP) control to target of <140/90 mmHg for 6
weeks after giving birth is safe and leads to lower rates of immediate postpartum complications. However, two
critical gaps in knowledge remain: 1) Does more intensive postpartum therapy during vascular remodeling
reduce the number of individuals with chronic HTN at one-year postpartum, and 2) Does the favorable impact of
lowering BP translate into improved vascular function and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, known to predict
future adverse CV events. We plan to address these gaps with Reducing the risk of chronic hypErtension and
imProving vAscular functIon following pReeclampsia (REPAIR) study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial
of 618 patients with HDP randomized to tight BP control postpartum versus usual care. Our central hypothesis
is that intensive short-term (for 6 weeks) BP control during vascular remodeling that happens after childbirth, will
accelerate recovery of vascular function and reduce the risk of chronic HTN and future CVD. We will pursue the
following two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of intensive postpartum BP control on new diagnosis of
chronic HTN at one year postpartum; and 2) Determine the effect of intensive postpartum BP control on vascular
function and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk following HDP. We will utilize remote BP monitoring with daily
medication adjustment the first 6 weeks postpartum, the time when there are substantial fluctuations in BP. Given
racial disparities in HDP and CVD, oversampling of Black patients with HDP will be done to ensure they comprise
50% of study participants. The primary outcome, new onset chronic HTN, defined as stage I HTN ≥130/80
mmHg, and secondary outcomes, change in FMD, PWV, and sFlt-1, will be evaluated at one year postpartum.
The REPAIR study will provide high-level evidence for BP management postpartum and will have a direct impact
on clinical practice. If proven effective, the REPAIR study will lead to standardization of postpartum BP
management and to reduction in the long-term risk of CVD following HDP. This contribution will be significant
because the at-risk population for HDP is growing and our impact will increase over time."

10887259,"Project Summary/Abstract
Research: Despite the recent groundbreaking discoveries in the field of nanomedicine, tumor-specific delivery
of therapeutics still poses a big hurdle for translation of nanoparticle-based approaches. Engineered bacteria
have recently emerged as a novel delivery vehicle against cancer by producing therapeutics such as bacterial
toxins and checkpoint blockade to take advantage of their capability to produce therapeutics in situ. However,
their therapeutic efficacy has been limited against tumors and unable to accommodate non-biological
therapies. This project aims to understand interaction between bacteria and nanoparticles in tumor
microenvironment to enable coordination of these two platforms for cancer therapy through synergy between
synthetic biology and nanomedicine. Aim 1 will engineer bacteria to reprogram tumor microenvironment to
enhance penetration of nanoparticles. Bacteria will be programmed to reorganize aberrant extracellular matrix
of tumor by producing proteases and inhibitor of the upstream pathway. Aim 2 will program in situ interaction
between nanoparticles and bacteria for enhanced delivery of nanoparticles in tumor. Bacteria will be
engineered to display peptide tag that nanoparticle can target, and this programmable interaction will allow
spatial coordination between bacteria and nanoparticles for drug delivery. The data generated here will reflect
potential opportunities and challenges of combining two platforms to create biohybrid systems for cancer
therapy. The completion of these aims will generate strategies to program bacteria and nanoparticles that can
spatially and temporally coordinate with each other to develop biohybrid cancer therapy.

relapses. With this proposal, Dr. Fussner’s goals are to expand her skillset to include advanced statistical
modeling and bioinformatics coupled with understanding of immunological methods to investigate novel
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AAV, and leverage markers and modifiers of those mechanisms for
personalized management of these rare diseases. Career Development Plan: To achieve these goals, Dr.
Fussner and her primary mentor, Dr. Kymberly Gowdy, MS, PhD, have outlined a comprehensive career
development plan incorporating coursework and experiential learning in immunology, biostatistics,
bioinformatics, and strategies for study design in rare diseases. Central to this plan is strong mentorship from
Dr. Gowdy (expert in translational innate immunity in lung and vascular diseases), Ohio State co-mentors, Dr.
Elliott Crouser (pulmonary/critical care physician-scientist, monocytes as biomarkers) and Dr. Guy Brock
(biostatistics/bioinformatics), and international leaders in vasculitis, Drs. Ulrich Specks (pulmonary physician-
scientist at Mayo Clinic) and Peter Merkel (rheumatology physician-scientist at Penn, Director of the Vasculitis
Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC)). Environment: Ohio State’s research environment couples a large
patient population with well-funded multidisciplinary clinical, translational, and basic research infrastructure. This
includes the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute.
Research: Dr. Fussner will investigate the role of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) and monocytes as drivers and
markers of AAV. A1AT is the primary inhibitor of proteinase 3, which is the predominant target of ANCAs in the
western hemisphere. Patients with A1AT deficiency alleles have increased risk of AAV, and our preliminary data
indicate that A1AT genotype impacts the clinical phenotype of AAV. Dr. Fussner’s specific aims are: Aim 1:
Determine whether A1AT levels, alone or in combination with ANCA levels and monocyte inflammatory
markers, predict disease activity and clinical phenotype of AAV. Aim 2: Determine whether ANCA-
induced monocyte signatures predict clinical features of AAV and evaluate the impact of exogenous
A1AT. Dr. Fussner will utilize clinical data and samples from two cohorts: (i) patients with AAV with and without
A1AT deficiency alleles from the VCRC, the world’s largest vasculitis biorepository, and (ii) a clinical trial cohort
of patients with relapsing AAV. Patient total and functional A1AT levels, and ANCA-induced monocyte responses
will be analyzed for prediction of disease activity and specific manifestations of AAV. These studies will enhance
understanding of AAV pathogenesis and identify new biomarkers and safer treatment strategies in AAV."
10887263,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its transmission across the
world was the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CoV entry is mainly initiated by the binding of furin
cleavage activated spike (S) protein with ACE2 receptor protein on the surface of host cell. Next, S2’
cleavage by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on the cell surface induce the conformational
change of S2 subunit to activate the membrane fusion and entry of virus genetic material. Therefore, S
protein has been the major target to design the vaccines and therapeutics. While a handful of
investigations have been reported about the structure of S protein:ACE2 complex, critical questions about
the detachment of S1/S2 subunits, structural changes in S2 and their dynamics to activate the membrane
fusion remain. These answers will help to improve the current understanding of the mechanism of virus
entry and should be highly significant for the development of effective preventions and therapeutics.
 I propose to combine novel DNA nanoswitch calipers (DNC), single-molecule fluorescence integrated
optical tweezers, and high-throughput magnetic tweezers to study the dynamics of the molecular events
associated with the membrane fusion process of viral entry and analyze the heterogeneity of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs). Using DNC that I developed, we showed the measurement of multiple distances within a
target biomolecule at angstrom level precision. Next, we showed the high-throughput measurements in
magnetic tweezers to analyze the heterogeneous mixture of peptides. Therefore, DNCs are useful to study
multicomponent protein-protein interactions and simultaneously monitor the structural changes associated with
the process. By executing these projects, I will have the following three important answers. First, I will measure
binding dynamics of full-length S protein and monomer/dimer ACE2 receptor proteins to understand the entire
energy landscape governing the interaction of these proteins. Second, I will measure the detachment kinetics
of S1/S2 subunits, induced by TMPRSS2 and determine the change in conformation of S2. These reactions
are critical to understand the membrane fusion process. Third, I will utilize the similar approach to measure the
binding dynamics of nAbs with S protein. By high-throughput measurements in magnetic tweezers, I will
analyze the efficacy and heterogeneity of nAbs to understand the immune response of the patients and
vaccinated individuals, and also validate DNC assay with a cell-based pseudovirus neutralization assay.
 Hence, the proposed work will provide detailed insight into understanding the mechanism of SARS-
CoV-2 entry and rapid analysis of immune response of the patients. My quantitative approaches and advanced
single-molecule approaches will bring insights, into the field of virology and immunology. This study will also
give me firsthand experience in biochemistry, molecular biology, virology, and immunology, enabling me to
better apply my quantitative and physical training to more topics in biological research in the future."
10888307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mammalian auditory brainstem contains specialized synapses that preserve the precise timing of action
potential spikes. We propose to study two of these specialized synapses: the large calyx of Held synapse in
the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the small bouton-type glycinergic synapses of the lateral
superior olive (LSO), that are linked through the MNTB principal neuron. The long-term goal is to determine the
biophysical properties and structure/function of these two pivotal synapses in the circuitry that computes the
locus of high frequency sounds. We will perform patch clamp recordings in mouse brainstem slices from more
adult-like stages of development, when mice fully acquire their fine-tuned ability to hear and localize sound.
Our preliminary data show that several fundamental aspects of brainstem synapses mature only at postnatal
day 30. We thus propose to study the synaptic delays, synaptic strength and short-term plasticity of adult-like
auditory synapses. The first hypothesis is that adult-like calyx-type nerve terminals in the MNTB contain
heterogeneous and crowded active zones (AZs) with multiple docked vesicles that produce ultrashort delays in
vesicle exocytosis. We will perform detailed ultrastructural reconstructions of the AZs using high-resolution
electron tomography (ET). We plan to identify the major factors that promote short exocytosis delays, such as
a large vesicle pool size, crowded AZs with diffusional barriers for Ca2+ ions and tight vesicle-to-Ca2+-channel
coupling. The second hypothesis is that the timing and strength of glycine release in the LSO change during
postnatal development due to shifts in release probability and the size of the readily releasable pool of
vesicles. We report for the first time that inhibitory postsynaptic currents from LSO neurons are preceded by a
prespike waveform that reflects the synchronous arrival of the presynaptic action potentials at multiple synaptic
boutons. This allowed us to quantify for the first time the synaptic delay of a glycinergic auditory synapse. We
will also test the hypothesis that the temporal precision of spike-evoked glycine release relies on large
multiquantal exocytosis. The third hypothesis to be tested is that during postnatal development the LSO
glycinergic synapse acquires a robust Ca2+-dependent vesicle recruitment mechanism. A sustained steady-
state release of glycine onto the LSO neurons thus effectively blocks their ability to fire spikes in response of
excitatory inputs. Our preliminary LSO data show, surprisingly in contrast to the calyx of Held, that maturing
glycinergic LSO synapses decrease their vesicle pool size and increase release probability. Using confocal
microscopy and genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators, we will image Ca2+ influx at glycinergic boutons, and for
the first time describe, using ET, their 3D ultrastructure at high resolution. Together with our collaborators we
will further validate and study the physiological relevance of our results using in vivo recordings and computer
modeling. The proposed experiments will launch new studies on mature LSO synapse structure/function using
electron tomography, patch clamp recordings, and direct Ca2+ imaging of LSO bouton-type nerve terminals."

The goal of this application, submitted in response to PAR-19-368, “Accelerating the Pace of Drug Abuse
Research Using Existing Data” is to leverage data from the NIDA Clinical Trials Network to enhance our
understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity in psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders.
Treatment effect heterogeneity is particularly a concern in research of substance use disorder treatments, in
part due to heterogeneous sub-phenotypes of patients in symptom profile, disease course, and recovery
trajectory. Nevertheless, analysis of treatment effect heterogeneity in substance use disorder research has
been often conducted in a suboptimal manner using subgroup analysis (i.e., estimating impacts separately
within groups defined by a single covariate), which could result in finding spurious differences in treatment
effects by subgroup due to the performance of multiple statistical tests and random variability across patients.
Another challenge of single covariate-based subgroup analysis is that most covariates have small moderating
effects and their individual contribution to treatment effect heterogeneity is not meaningfully informative to
treatment decisions. Our objective is to apply a novel statistical method, causal forest approach, to
systematically examine treatment effect heterogeneity of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders.
This study uses data from 12 randomized controlled trials in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network which examined
effectiveness of nine distinct psychosocial treatments against treatment-as-usual condition (Motivational
Incentives, Motivational Enhancement Therapy, Screening Motivational Assessment, Therapeutic Education
System, Brief Strategic Family Therapy, Twelve-Step Facilitation, Motivational Interviewing, Seeking Safety,
and Exercise Program). For each type of psychosocial treatment, we propose to implement the causal forest
approach to estimate the expected effect of a treatment for each individual while taking into account multiple
covariates simultaneously. The estimated treatment effects will be used to test the presence and degree of
treatment effect heterogeneity in each type of psychosocial treatment. Using the variable importance measure
obtained from the causal forest, we also plan to identify the most important covariates contributing to treatment
effect heterogeneity in each type of psychosocial treatment. These analyses will be repeated for multiple
outcomes (e.g., abstinence, reduction in frequency of target substance use) to examine whether and how the
degree of treatment effect heterogeneity as well as common effect moderators differ across outcomes. Overall,
these analyses will grow the evidence base that can be used by treatment providers to guide treatment
decisions for individual patients with substance use disorders."
10888309,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fibrotic lung remodeling is a hallmark of many lung diseases, including severe influenza infection, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19. While a basal-like epithelial cell has been identified as a central player to this
aberrant repair response, little has been done to investigate the behavior and interactions of other cells in the
diseased tissue, particularly alveolar macrophages. Therefore, the goal of this study is to leverage a biomimetic
engineered lung model system to investigate the relationship between regenerating basal-like progenitor cells
and pulmonary macrophages. This engineered lung tissue system is based on cellular repopulation and culture
of a decellularized native rat lung scaffold. This platform enables a well-controlled, native-like tissue environment
for the evaluation of cell-cell interactions, without the systemic confounders of in vivo studies. It is expected that
macrophages will significantly influence and direct epithelial remodeling by these basal-like cells, particularly in
relation to the fibrotic or anti-fibrotic activation state of the macrophages. This work expands on previous findings
that adding macrophages to engineered lung cultures containing basal-like progenitor cells significantly improves
tissue architecture and regenerative epithelial cell phenotype, compared to engineered lung cultures without
macrophages. First, pulmonary macrophages will be isolated from rats by bronchoavleolar lavage and
characterized. Protocols will be developed to chemically stimulate macrophages in vitro to a disease-like
inflammatory state, or to a reparative anti-fibrotic state. Next, macrophages of different activation states will be
introduced to air-liquid interface cultures of regenerative basal cells, to evaluate epithelial-macrophage
interactions in isolation. Finally, activated macrophages will be introduced to engineered lung cultures containing
regenerative basal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelium to recapitulate essential native cellular communities.
Engineered lung tissues will be evaluated for histologic and biomechanic changes between conditions, as well
as differential cell signaling patterns, as evaluated by single-cell RNA sequencing. It is expected that
inflammatory macrophages will contribute to fibrotic response in regenerating epithelium, whereas anti-fibrotic
macrophages will contribute to more functional alveolar regeneration by basal-like cells. The findings of this
study will elucidate the role of pulmonary macrophages in governing lung repair and regeneration in this model
system. Further, this work may suggest possible routes for the treatment of fibrotic lung diseases. The proposed
research project will be executed by Allison M. Greaney at the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under the Sponsorship of Dr. Robert Langer, and
Co-Sponsorship of Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov at Yale University. Dr. Langer and Dr. Medzhitov will mentor Allison in
her Research and Professional Training Goals to develop new research and scientific communication skills, so
she may be well-equipped to secure a tenure-track faculty position at a top research institution."

Venous thrombosis affects approximately 1 in 200 hospitalized children. Important symptoms after deep
venous thrombosis (DVT) involving lower extremities and pulmonary embolism (PE) include shortness of
breath and exercise intolerance resulting in a decreased quality of life. The mechanisms of these symptoms
are unknown. Although patients with venous thrombosis with excise intolerance and exertional dyspnea are
generally considered to be deconditioned, our preliminary data challenge this conventional wisdom. Thus, it is
presently unclear if exercise intolerance or exertional dyspnea are due to cardiovascular, pulmonary, or limb-
muscle dysfunction and whether acquired risk-factors such as deconditioning or obesity contribute to these
problems. If we find evidence of deconditioning causing or complicating exercise intolerance or dyspnea,
exercise training would be dramatically beneficial; for obesity-related changes in respiratory mechanics,
aggressive weight loss measures may be necessary before exercise training can be tolerated. In this
application, we will utilize state-of-the-art measures, including 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging, at rest and
during exercise to investigate central and peripheral mechanisms of these common symptoms. Aim 1 will
characterize cardiac limitations; Aim 2, pulmonary and Aim 3, skeletal muscle metabolic aberrations following
DVT and PE at 3 and 12 months post-diagnosis in pediatric patients following diagnosis. Our long-term
objective is to provide novel and clinically relevant results that could potentially alter approaches for preventing
and treating exercise intolerance and dyspnea and improving the quality of life for pediatric patients with VTE."
10886558,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Following transcription, mRNAs transmit the genetic information that dictates protein production. In eukaryotes,
transcription and translation occur at different timings and in distinct subcellular compartments. It is commonly
believed that these two fundamental processes are uncoupled and have little “cross-talk”. Recent evidence
suggests that translation of aberrant mRNAs leads to genetic compensation, a transcriptional response to
rapidly upregulate genes with similar functions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cytoplasmic
translation communicates with nuclear transcription remain elusive. During the course of studying translational
control in response to amino acid starvation, we observed transcriptional upregulation of genes undergoing
stress-induced ribosome pausing. Relying on a newly developed sequencing method, Ezra-seq, we discovered
the existence of endogenous ribosome footprints. We hypothesize that these mRNA fragments serve as novel
chromatin modulators by influencing gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner. The goal of this
proposal is to characterize the genetic circuit coupling cytoplasmic translation and nuclear transcription. By
identifying and mapping chromatin-associated ribosome footprints, we will elucidate the novel type of RNA-
mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We propose that the genetic circuit formed by ribosomes
contributes to genetic robustness and is a common mechanism for stress adaptation. We will also explore the
potential of designing artificial ribosome footprints to achieve controllable gene expression, revealing new
routes toward novel therapeutics. The conceptual establishment of ribosome-mediated genetic circuit is
transformative in our understanding of the central dogma in molecular biology and opens a new research
avenue towards genetic reprogramming."
10886712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal childbirth injury is the leading risk factor for pelvic floor muscle dysfunction and the resultant pelvic floor
disorders, which include pelvic organ prolapse and urinary and fecal incontinence. Despite high prevalence,
significant morbidities, and economic burden associated with pelvic floor disorders, preventative strategies are
almost non-existent, and the available treatments are delayed and compensatory as they do not directly target
the underlying pathophysiology. Thus, our long-term goal is the development of new, minimally invasive tissue-
engineered therapies for the prevention and treatment of pelvic muscle dysfunction. Our pilot studies of pelvic
floor muscle morphometric properties in parous women with pelvic organ prolapse and the rat model of simulated
birth injury demonstrate substantial degeneration, specifically cell death, myofiber atrophy and fibrosis. The above
alterations render muscles insensitive to rehabilitation and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. We
developed a novel tissue-specific injectable extracellular matrix hydrogel, derived from decellularized porcine
skeletal muscles, which promotes muscle regeneration. This proposal is centered around the overall hypothesis
that the skeletal muscle matrix hydrogel, which contains tissue-specific cues, can be delivered alone at the time
of birth injury to prevent pelvic floor muscle dysfunction or following a maladaptive post birth injury recovery to
reverse pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. We will test this hypothesis in our translationally-relevant pregnant model
by comparing untreated and treated pelvic floor muscle phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional signatures at
multiple time points following birth injury and determining mechanisms by which the extracellular matrix hydrogel
enhances regeneration. Collectively, this innovative study will provide comprehensive and functionally relevant
assessments of the role of this low-cost acellular minimally invasive regenerative therapy in pelvic floor muscle
recovery following birth injury and the fundamental knowledge of the biological processes involved in the
regulation of pelvic floor muscle regeneration. The above has a high potential for the development of novel
preventative and therapeutic strategies to counteract pelvic muscle dysfunction and the related pelvic floor
disorders."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 5 million Americans. At 
the same time that the prevalence of AD is increasing, the number of new investigators in the US is 
decreasing, which may severely hamper our efforts to develop better diagnostic and treatment tools for AD and 
related dementias (ADRD). The goal of the Research Education Component (REC) of the Goizueta 
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Emory is to support research educational activities that 
complement and enhance the training of the future workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and 
clinical needs in ADRD. We will achieve this goal by identifying and supporting the research education of junior 
investigators and trainees from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. In Aim 1, REC leadership and mentors 
will work with these trainees to develop and execute tailored educational plans for new and early stage 
investigators to advance towards independence in conducting AD-related research. In Aim 2, we will leverage 
Emory’s wealth of basic and clinical scientists as well as partner Atlanta-area institutions to identify, recruit and 
support the research training of new/early stage investigators and trainees from diverse backgrounds and 
disciplines, with special emphasis on URMs, to engage in AD-related research. In Aim 3, the REC leadership 
and external advisory committee will rigorously monitor and evaluate the trainees, mentors, and the overall 
program, and implement improvements when necessary. Success of the REC will result in rolling cohorts of 
new investigators with a focus on diversity to lead the next generation of ADRD research."

clinical translation of basic and population science research from Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center 
(SCCC) research programs and identification of clinically relevant hypotheses for testing by SCCC basic science 
programs. The four program specific aims focus on therapeutic development and biomarker discovery, where 
members work collectively to: (1) develop molecular therapeutic sensitizers by focusing on the development of 
unique tumor-selective agents that enhance existing therapies, (2) target tumor microenvironment with 
immunotherapy by modulating the role of immune cells in tumor progression, (3) advance imaging and drug 
delivery by developing novel imaging and nanotechnology delivery platforms to enhance cancer diagnosis and 
therapy, and (4) exploit cancer vulnerabilities by leveraging synthetic lethalities as new “targeted” therapy for 
cancer. The ET Program brings together 78 SCCC members from six basic science and 12 clinical departments 
comprising 44 NCI-funded projects, including two SPOREs and 14 multi-PD/PI awards. In response to evaluative 
activities and strategic goals to facilitate collaborative translational research, ET recruited new senior clinical 
researchers; expanded translational studies and investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs) to include most cancer 
types and to address the needs of the catchment area; enhanced interactions with SCCC members; integrated 
radiation oncology faculty into the program; and improved the infrastructure and funding for IITs. ET members 
participate in and lead multicenter IITs and they collaborate with pharma/biotech, which often leads to 
investigator-initiated trials and translational studies. Importantly, the funded SPORE programs in kidney and lung 
cancers and new SPORE applications in prostate and liver cancers are actively supported by ET member 
expertise. The ET Program has expanded therapeutic pipelines in a majority of adult and pediatric cancers. 
Highlighted successes include the in-house development and clinical translation of therapeutic strategies for 
KRAS mutant cancers, HIF2alpha-targeting for kidney cancer, antagonists against mutant estrogen receptors in 
breast cancers, strategies to activate the STING innate immune pathway, and clinical trials capitalizing on 
synergy between stereotactic radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Future directions include 
investment in preclinical models (spheroid/organoid cultures, humanized mice), precision oncology (customized 
panels, SCCC molecular tumor boards, recruitment of a translational leader in genomic oncology), immuno- 
oncology (immune profiling; novel PET tracers; systemic and organ-specific autoantibody biomarkers; expansion 
of the innate immunity program), disease-focused translational research programs (recruitment of leadership in 
breast, GI, lung, GU, neuro-oncology, hematologic malignancies, and Phase I programs); and expansion of 
interactions with the Office of Community Outreach, Education & Equity in order to increase clinical trial accruals

Millions of people worldwide are affected by liver diseases. Some of these individuals progress to acute or acute-
on-chronic liver failure where liver transplant becomes the only recourse. Given the shortage of transplantable
organs, over >40% of patients on the waitlist do not receive a liver transplant in a timely manner. This motivates
a strong interest in developing bioartificial liver (BAL) systems that may be used as a bridge-to-transplantation
or a bridge-to-recovery for patients with liver failure. BAL systems are populated with liver cells (hepatocytes)
that perform a wide array of liver functions (e.g. protein synthesis and glucose regulation) in addition to detoxifi-
cation. Ideally, BAL systems should contain human hepatocytes, however, because such cells are typically
derived from cadaveric organs, their availability is limited. Use of xenogenic (e.g. porcine) hepatocytes is com-
mon but less than ideal because of the potential for zoonotic transmission of diseases. Human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generally known as human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs), may be expanded indefinitely and differentiated into any desired cell type, including hepatocytes.
hPSCs hold incredible promise as the source of cells for many therapeutic strategies, including BAL systems.
There are, however, distinct challenges that remain to be addressed: 1) stem cell (SC)-hepatocytes need to be
differentiated at scale to achieve sufficient liver mass (~ 200 gr) to treat a patient, and 2) functionality of SC-
hepatocytes needs to be improved to approach that of adult hepatocytes. Our project will take a step toward
addressing these challenges by developing bioactive heparin-containing microcapsules that will carry hPSCs,
will be loaded with growth factors for local and sustained delivery, and will enable high-density suspension cul-
tures.
Broader Impact: This project will enable scalable differentiation of hPSCs through the use of microencapsula-
tion. Microcapsules will be used to deliver inductive cues for stem cell differentiation and will protect cells from
mechanical damage in a stirred bioreactor. The use of microcapsules will allow us to increase the rate of oxygen
and nutrient delivery to the cells and will enable higher density cultures. While the present project focuses on
using encapsulated SC-hepatocytes in a BAL system, immunoisolation and other survival advantages offered
by microcapsules will also enable future applications for cell transplantation."

lessons learned in RASOR (SEPA R25GM129838-01A1; Rural Alaska Students in One-health Research) to
co-create, with tribal partners, an ecosystem of One Health learning and research opportunities that are
culturally-centered and community-based. These efforts will create a sustainable network that encourages
integration of personal, cultural, and science identities, and will result in a greater sense of belonging and
persistence in biomedical and STEM careers. THE GOAL of OH STEM! is to increase representation of rural
and Indigenous Alaskans in biomedical and STEM fields and is supported by our 3 specific aims: AIM 1)
Culture - Implement culturally-centered One Health/STEM curricula to promote belonging and STEM
advancement in Indigenous and rural students. AIM 2) Continuity - Establish a frictionless ecosystem of
advancement pathways for Indigenous and rural student scientists. AIM 3) Sustainability - Create an
integrated, mutually supportive, and sustainable One Health/STEM and Culture network including Tribal
governments, cultural institutions, a Tribal research network and university partners supporting local school
districts and teachers.
OH STEM! will bring One Health experiences and experts to middle and high school students in remote
communities to spark awareness and excitement around STEM education and career opportunities in SE
Alaska. Two dual enrollment, variable credit courses: an Indigenized, place-based One Health Research

college credits, get matched with a research mentor, investigate a One Health research question, and develop
their critical thinking skills, all within their home community and cultural context. These experiences will prepare
them and connect them to opportunities to present their research, attend a conference, take additional
courses, intern, and work in One health research positions in their community. By emphasizing collaboration,
OH STEM! will facilitate the participation of students in multiple opportunities and scaffold along a continuum
from awareness and engagement to preparation, original contribution, and scientific self-efficacy. We will also
support the development of Southeast Alaska regional capacity to inspire and train STEM professionals with
strong science and cultural identities to meet the particular needs of their own communities. OH STEM! will

10888786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Microbial biofilm infections are a leading complication in healing of wounds arising in a multitude of settings,
including severe burns, non-healing pressure ulcers, dog bites, surgical site infections, and gunshot wounds.
Infection impairs the wound healing process and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. A recent
meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence of biofilms in chronic non-healing wounds is 78% [1]. Biofilm
formation imparts resistance to antibiotics through innate resistance factors including the drug diffusion barrier
of the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and through induced changes in gene expression, cell
signaling and metabolism. Significant correlations have been demonstrated between biofilm formation and
multi-drug resistance (MDR) in diverse clinical isolates from wounds [2]. An additional complication is that
biofilm formation and progression are not visible to the naked eye; as a result, biofilm infections are not
discerned until they are well established and recalcitrant to treatment.
A key barrier to identification and treatment of biofilm infections is penetration of their EPS in order for an
imaging contrast agent or therapeutic to reach the infecting bacteria. Penetration of biofilms by surfactants,
primarily through detergency and surface energy modifications that inhibit bacterial adhesion, may offer a
solution to this problem. Strong surfactants such as Tween 20 and Triton X-100 have been shown to disperse
biofilms but are too cytotoxic for systemic clinical applications. Polymeric surfactants such as poly(acrylic acid)
polyelectrolyte, Carbopol 934TM, and poly(alkylene oxide), Poloxamer 407TM, inhibit biofilm formation but are
non-specific and are not strongly antimicrobial [3].
We have recently developed novel graft polyelectrolyte surfactants (PS) that combine the functionalities of these
previously used materials with the ability to encapsulate into nanoparticles and deliver cationic antimicrobials
(CAMs), with the result being enhanced activity against biofilms in vitro. We propose that such PS can be
employed in the wound infection environment, both for imaging and for treatment, by formulation into a
“nanospray” that is able to achieve broad coverage within the wound bed, avoid rapid clearance of dyes or of
active CAMs in the highly active regenerating wound environment, and penetrate biofilm barriers via the
polyelectrolyte surfactant detergency. In order to test this hypothesis, we will: (1) expand the repertoire of CAMs
that can achieve favorable nanoformulation with the PS; (2) evaluate the ability of nanospray PS-CAM
formulations to treat biofilms in vitro and in vivo; and (3) develop and evaluate the ability of PS-CAM-ICG (where
ICG = indocyanine green) formulations to image biofilm formation."
10888789,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Exogenous oxytocin (OT) is widely used for the induction of labor in pregnant women. Though induction of labor
with OT confers many maternal and neonatal benefits, its use is not without adverse effects. Epidemiological
studies suggest an association between OT use and neurodevelopmental disorders, but they are conflicting and
do not provide mechanistic information. This knowledge gap is concerning because signaling through the OT
receptor (OTR) is critical for the establishment of social behavior in mammalian species. With the rising popularity
of elective induction of labor, where labor is induced for convenience and not for maternal or fetal indications, it
is important to comprehensively understand the impact of maternally administered OT on the developing brain.
Though OTR dysregulation in the developing brain has been suggested as a possible mechanism, mechanistic
studies are lacking because of the lack of a high-fidelity animal model that mimics labor management in pregnant
women. To address this, we successfully created and validated a pregnant rat model for labor induction by
continuously delivering an escalating dose of intravenous OT through a microprocessor-controlled precision
pump. In new preliminary studies, we adapted this high-fidelity model to mice with minor technical modifications
and confirmed that induced birth with OT was associated with a substantial decrease in OTR gene expression
in the neonatal mouse cortex. The fundamental objective of this proposal, therefore, is to chart the developmental
trajectory of OTR and OT expression in the postnatal brain after induced birth with OT. To accomplish this, we
will induce labor with OT in transgenic reporter mice (OTRvenus/+) and leverage the use of high-resolution brain-
wide imaging techniques (serial two-photon tomography and light sheet fluorescent microscopy imaging) to
comprehensively visualize the developing OTR-OT system in the postnatal brain (Aim 1). Motivated by our
observations of early communicative delay and impaired empathy-like behaviors in male rat offspring after
induced birth with OT, we will extend these behavioral studies to mice to enable mapping of dysregulated
behavior to brain-wide changes in the OTR-OT system (Aim 2).
Successful completion of these experiments will (i) provide a comprehensive perturbation map of how perinatal
OT exposure alters the developmental trajectory of the OTR-OT system, and (ii) delineate the neurobehavioral
impact of such perturbation. Because these studies are ethically inconceivable in human subjects, combining
our mouse model for labor induction with innovative whole brain imaging techniques provides unparalleled
opportunities to comprehensively answer this important question. Regardless of the outcome of our research,
our findings will have a significant impact — be it a paradigm shift in current dogma or providing scientific
reassurance to potential mothers."
10888861,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Down syndrome (DS) is a developmental genetic condition caused by trisomy of human chromosome 211-6. DS occurs
in approximately 1 in 600-1000 live births and affects more than 300,000 individuals in the USA. Neuropathological
and clinical features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) present early in life through the seventh decade in a predictable
sequence of events, and include amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, nerve growth factor (NGF) dysmetabolism
and cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration, CNS inflammation, and cognitive decline1-10. DS is an outstanding
natural genetic model for the study of AD pathophysiology, AD biomarkers research and to conduct
preventive clinical trials. Despite the molecular and genetic similarities between AD and DS, there exists a paucity
of information on the biological mechanisms underlying the onset of cognitive decline in adults with DS. For this
INCLUDE application, our overall goal is to investigate DS-specific pathophysiological mechanisms of AD
and identify novel biomarkers within and outside of the AT(N) framework, with a special focus on immune
and NGF dysregulation at different stages of AD pathology in DS by capitalizing on the ongoing highly successful
collaboration between our teams: Jorge Busciglio (University of California, Irvine, USA), Claudio Cuello (McGill
University, Montreal, Canada), Thomas Wisniewski (New York University, NY, USA) and Juan Fortea (Hospital of
Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain)7-9, 11, 12.
We propose to test the central hypothesis that CNS inflammation and NGF metabolic dysfunction are early and key
pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration, accelerated aging and cognitive decline in DS. As
detailed below, we will utilize a novel approach combining unbiased discovery (transcriptomics and proteomics)
(Aim 1) and targeted biomarker analyses (Aim 2), using multiple complementary model systems, to establish a
model of the temporal relationship between immune and NGF dysregulation and AD-related
neurodegenerative changes in persons with DS (Aim 3). This will be achieved by correlating our findings with AD
pathology, related biofluidic and imaging biomarker data from among the largest well characterized, DS patient
population found globally. We propose the following 3 aims:
Aim 1: To elucidate the relationships between immune deregulation and NGF dysmetabolism with AT(N)
hallmarks in the DS brain and in human trisomy 21 cortical cultures.
Aim 2: To investigate the presence of immune dysregulation and NGF dysmetabolism markers in plasma and
CSF and in extracellular vesicles derived from brain tissue, primary cultures and body fluids across the AD
continuum in DS.
Aim 3: To establish the temporal ordering of immune dysregulation and NGF dysmetabolism with respect to
the AT(N) framework within a cohort of adults with DS assessed longitudinally with multimodal biomarkers.
The comprehensive combination of neuropathological, cellular, and clinical studies using the same biomarkers will
lead to a detailed characterization of the role of immune and trophic factor alterations in the development of AD
pathology and associated cognitive decline in DS. Guided by the INCLUDE initiative goals, the results will inform
future preventive trials and assist in the prediction of the onset and evolution of AD dementia and in the identification
of potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this vulnerable population."
10888864,"The objective of this competitive renewal R01 is to continue to uncover mechanisms that contribute to the severity
of disease in the 30%+ of asthmatics who are sensitized to fungi. Leukotrienes, immunopathogenic mediators
derived from the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), are often elevated in severe
asthma. As such, this pathway is a therapeutic target of the FDA-approved anti-asthmatic drugs Zileuton®/Zyflo®
(inhibits 5-LOX) and Singulair®/Montelukast® (leukotriene receptor antagonist). A second enzyme involved in
AA metabolism is 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX). We show that asthmatic C57BL/6 wild-type mice have
increased lung expression of Alox15 mRNA as well as increased levels of the 12/15-LOX product 12-HETE
compared to naïve or vehicle treated mice. Asthmatic 12/15-LOX deficient mice (Alox15-/-) demonstrated lower
airway hyperactivity (AHR) in the presence of lower type 1 and type 2-associated mediators, lower chemokine
levels and decreases in multiple myeloid cell types. Bone marrow chimera studies identified 12/15-LOX
expression in hematopoietic cells as contributing to exacerbation of allergic fungal asthma. Intriguingly, the
absence of 12/15-LOX expression in dendritic cells and/or macrophages (via Cd11c Cre/Alox15 floxed mice)
had no effect on AHR, implicating other hematopoietic cells in driving 12/15-LOX mediated AHR during allergic
fungal asthma. In other data, we demonstrate the development of a 12/15-LOX reporter mouse in which 12/15-
LOX is HA-tagged and show feasibility of using these mice to identify 12/15-LOX expressing cells in the lung by
flow cytometry. Thus, 12/15-LOXHA mice will serve as a novel tool to identify hematopoietic/myeloid cell type(s)
expressing 12/15-LOX during allergic fungal asthma. In other studies, we found that mice deficient in immune
response gene 1 (Irg1-/-) (also known as aconitate decarboxylase, Acod1), which generates the
immunomodulatory TCA cycle metabolite itaconate, clear A. fumigatus from the lung more efficiently, seemingly
as a result of increased proinflammatory responses and augmented macrophage and neutrophil antifungal
activity. In contrast, Irg1/Acod1-/- subjected to allergic fungal asthma had increased AHR, indicating a protective
role for itaconate. Collectively, we hypothesize that the severity of allergic fungal asthma is dictated by the
balance between specific lipidomic (i.e. 12/15-LOX) and metabolomic (itaconate) responses. The specific aims
of the proposal are: (1) to define hematopoietic-associated 12/15-lipoxygenase dependent mechanisms
promoting AHR during allergic fungal asthma, (2) to define mechanisms of itaconate-mediated regulation of AHR
during allergic fungal asthma and (3) to define the therapeutic potential of 12/15-LOX and itaconate on AHR
during allergic fungal asthma."
10890657,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria often change their cell shape as a fitness strategy to survive or thrive in diverse environments.
Filamentation is one such morphological strategy, whereby a bacterium dramatically increases in cell size as
it undergoes longitudinal growth without septation. Many bacteria have been observed to undergo
filamentation, but the purpose of these filaments in a host animal is often unknown and the genetic
mechanisms governing this morphological change are largely understudied, outside of the canonical SOS
response. This proposal utilizes an innovative model system to study bacterial filamentation in the context of
a host animal, which consists of a facultative intracellular bacterium, Bordetella atropi, that filaments in the
genetic model organisms Oscheius tipulae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Strikingly, B. atropi uses
filamentation as an adaptive response to nutrients for cell-to-cell spreading: after invasion of an intestinal
epithelial cell, B. atropi converts from a coccobacillus to a filamentous morphology and these filaments invade
multiple neighboring epithelial cells. This filamentation by B. atropi was found to be independent of the
canonical SOS response but required a conserved nutrient-sensing pathway, the glucolipid pathway, which
produces and utilizes the bacterial metabolite UDP-glucose. Divergent bacteria use the glucolipid pathway to
detect rich culture conditions and delay the divisome resulting in moderately larger progeny after binary
division. Taken together, these discoveries suggest that B. atropi detects the rich intracellular environment of
its host cell to trigger filamentation, allowing it to invade neighboring cells. This proposal will further elucidate
the mechanism that the glucolipid pathway uses to inhibit the bacterial divisome and initiate filamentation,
uncover the role that host metabolites play in triggering the phenotype, and discover other genes/pathways
controlling intracellular filamentation by bacteria. First, the genetic mechanism that glucolipid pathway
members use to constitutively inhibit septation will be investigated in B. atropi and this pathway will be tested
in related bacterial species for a role in controlling filamentation. Second, given that the glucolipid pathway
can delay binary division in bacteria grown on rich media, B. atropi will be tested for dependency on host
glucose levels and a rich intracellular environment to induce filamentation. Finally, a transposon mutagenesis
screen will identify a majority of bacterial genes required for intracellular filamentation in O. tipulae. The
results established here will serve as a technical roadmap for determining whether other bacteria can use the
glucolipid pathway or other novel genetic pathways to induce filamentation. Given the importance of
filamentation to bacterial function and survival in a variety of niches, including in the context of a host animal,
this work will increase our understanding of both the environmental triggers and genetic mechanisms that
lead this vital morphological change."

 The element iron plays an enormous role in biology, including electron transport reactions
(ferredoxins), oxygen transport and storage (hemoglobin and myoglobin), catalysis
(nitrogenase, P-450, hydrogenase, and thousands of other enzymes), small molecule sensing
(especially O2, CO, and NO), and DNA processing and repair. The health-relatedness of a
better understanding of the structure and function of biological Fe is clear.
 The general theme of research in the Cramer lab involves the use spectroscopy as a tool
for characterization of metals in biological systems. Much of this work involves the application
of synchrotron radiation x-ray sources. Thanks to enormous improvements of these sources,
experiments with exquisite sensitivity can now be conducted on dilute Fe samples. These
include the technique Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS), which is sensitive
to the motion of 57Fe in a sample. Another new technique, nuclear-resonant time-domain
interferometry (NR-TDI) can probe motion of all atoms in a sample. The x-ray experiments at
international facilities are complemented by IR and Raman measurements at the home lab.
The goals for the next 4 years can be divided into 3 main themes:
· better understanding of the catalytic intermediates of the enzymes that process hydrogen –
 [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases,
· information about structural changes that occur when Fe-S cluster proteins sense their
 environment, including mitoNEET and NAF-1, two health-related proteins which sense and
 communicate pH and redox status, and
· characterization of protein dynamics in extremophiles (organisms that live at extremes of
 temperature, pressure, pH and other stressors) using the protein rubredoxin as a model
 system and using NRVS and NR-TDI to respectively measure the motion of Fe or the entire
protein.
 The overall vision of this research program is to use spectroscopic methods to better
understand how iron is used in important proteins, in ways that complement the information
that can be gathered from diffraction and microscopy. In the course of research on specific
topics, spectroscopic techniques such as NRVS will be further developed for the bioinorganic
community. The novel NR-TDI technique will be assessed as a complementary probe of
dynamical information about proteins."
10890664,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Autoimmune tissue inflammation is dictated by a balance between effector and regulatory T cells.
During an autoimmune reaction, effector T cells hyper proliferate, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines
and suppress expansion and generation of regulatory T cells resulting in inflammation. Cytokines play
a key role in the process, but other factors such as metabolism and physical factors like oxygen tension,
pH and space in tissue microenvironment play an equally important role in regulating effector vs. Treg
balance. However, the analysis of T cell metabolism in tissue is challenging due to limitations of
available cell numbers and current metabolic techniques. We developed a novel computational
algorithm called Compass that can predict metabolic state of cells using single cell RNAseq data.
Facilitated by this tool, we identified polyamine metabolism as a major driver of pathogenicity of Th17
cells. Herein we observed that Odc1 inhibition can regulate mitochondrial function by increasing
mitochondrial complex stability genes with potential consequences in effector T cell function. Further,
our preliminary data suggests a connection between the polyamine pathway (rate limiting enzyme,
Odc1) and an epigenome modifier, JMJD3/Kdm6b. We also provide evidence that inhibition of the
Odc1-JMJD3 axis by chemical inhibitors or genetic deletion modifies the transcriptome and epigenome
(genome accessibility) of Th17 cells in favor of Tregs with relevance in tissue inflammation in CNS in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Based on these data we hypothesize that
polyamine pathway is a critical metabolic and epigenetic regulator of effector vs. Treg differentiation
and thereby affects development of tissue inflammation. The key element of the pathway, Odc1-
JMJD3 axis is a checkpoint that can be regulated by cytokines and can sense environmental
cues such as hypoxia and subsequently adjust metabolic and epigenomic state of T cells to
regulate effector vs. regulatory T cell balance. We will test this hypothesis in two aims: 1) determine
how polyamine biosynthesis restricts mitochondrial oxphos and promotes reverse electron transport to
impact effector vs. Treg development in inflamed CNS during EAE; 2) determine whether polyamine
metabolism enzyme Odc1 interferes with JMJD3 function to modulate the genome accessibility of T
cells favoring Th17 over Treg development during EAE development. The polyamine metabolism
pathway likely has broader implications in T cell biology. Hence, we will focus on the relevance of the
Odc1-JMJD3 axis in inflamed CNS in the context of Th17/Treg balance. The proposed study is highly
relevant in human diseases as reflected by a significant overlap (about 25%) between multiple-
sclerosis risk variants and genes that differentially regulate effector Th17 vs. Treg differentiation."

FLASH irradiations, irradiations with dose rates >40 Gy/s, have been shown to greatly reduce
radiation damage for normal tissue while not affecting tumor control. This sparing effect was
demonstrated in multiple animal models, mostly using electron FLASH irradiations. The pre-
clinical data generated a strong push to translate FLASH radiation therapy (RT) into the clinic.
Only a few human patients have so far been treated with FLASH-RT. The first patient, a
single cutaneous lymphoma lesion was treated with electron FLASH-RT. Recently, Varian an-
nounced the first clinical trial of proton FLASH-RT (phase 1) and treated the first patients with
symptomatic bone metastases.
Yet many questions remain unanswered. Most significantly, the underlying mechanism of
FLASH induced sparing of healthy tissue still remain elusive. As corollary, the constraints im-
posed on the clinical parameters (e.g. dose, dose rate and time within and between treatment
fields) to induce the FLASH tissue sparing effect are still not determined.
While there are many experimental efforts currently being pursued, my team has worked on
understanding FLASH both from an experimental as well as theoretical point of view. Our ex-
perimental preliminary data show proton FLASH tissue sparing in intestine, brain and skin.
Our theoretical preliminary data include modeling oxygen depletion and simulations of radi-
ochemistry using TOPAS-nBio, a mechanistic Monte Carlo framework developed by our group.
Our central hypothesis is that the FLASH effect is caused by a combination of (stem) cells in
a low-oxygen niche and long-lived (µs to ms) daughter products of chemical reactions involving
oxygen. We propose an interplay between experiments and modeling to determine the under-
lying mechanism of FLASH-RT tissue sparing by employing TOPAS-nBio to investigate the
involved chemical reactions based on their intrinsic time features.
We propose to test the hypothesis and validate the model with the following aims:
SA 1: Investigate the mechanisms of proton FLASH-RT
 1. Conduct multi-scale experiments to guide the modeling efforts.
 2. Model the mechanism and chemical processes at relevant time scales in TOPAS-nBio.
SA 2: Validate the model and determine clinical parameters for FLASH tissue sparing."

One of the fundamental scientific problems in neuroscience is to have a good understanding of how cognition and
behavior emerge from brain function. Tremendous strides have been made over the past decade to elucidate the biological
mechanism that creates remarkable oscillatory patterns of functional fluctuations. From a data science perspective,
functional neural activities manifest geometric patterns, as evidenced by the evolving network topology of functional
connectivities (FC) even in the resting state. Since the co-activation of spontaneous functional fluctuations is often
encoded in a symmetric and positive-definite (SPD) matrix, it is more reasonable to put the spotlight on the geometric
patterns of evolving functional connectomes on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, instead of using Euclidean
operations. In this regard, we will develop a novel computational model to understand the control mechanism underlying
functional dynamics through the lens of cutting-edge manifold, control theory, and machine learning technologies. The
overarching goal of our project is to establish a new underpinning of the relationship between analytic measurement of
control mechanisms and cognitive functions, which allows us to understand the mechanism of how the human brain works
and discover new imaging biomarkers with great mathematics guarantee. To do so, we define a trajectory of the complex
neural system to be the temporal path on the Riemannian manifold that steers the human brain traverses through diverse
cognitive states. In this regard, we will first develop a deep end-to-end model to uncover the characteristic equation of
dynamical systems from the time series of FC matrices in Aim 1. The backbone of our deep model is a data-driven
linearization process that projects high-dimensional manifold instances to a subspace such that the nonlinear dynamic
mechanism of evolving SPD matrices on the manifold can be dissected using a well-studied linear model on the latent
vector space. Furthermore, we integrate the notion of optimal control into the deep model, which allows us to (i) uncover
the multi-frequency oscillatory functional network modes for brain state transitions and (ii) measure the controllability for
not only the whole brain but also each brain region. We will address the following scientific questions in Aim 2 using the
existing unprecedented amount of human connectomes: (i) What is the relationship between brain controllability and
visual working memory? (ii) In what control mechanism does each brain region contribute to the altered functional
dynamics associated with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH)? (iii) What is the statistical power associated with the
identification of disease-specific connectomes using the newly established system-level understanding of functional
dynamics? Successfully executing this project will shed new light on elucidating the working mechanism that links brain
function and cognition, which is instrumental in understanding cognitive control in the neuroscience field. We will release
the software to facilitate other human connectome studies."

 While heart disease remains as the leading cause of death in the United States, an estimated 6.7 million
Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 2023 and over 11 million American
caregivers providing an estimated 18 billion hours of care valued at $339.5 billion. These astronomical
numbers continue increasing as the whole population is aging. Furthermore, women are more prevalent to AD
and have higher risk to cardiovascular disease at older age than men. Currently no cure of AD and very limited
treatment that may slowdown AD, the best alternative care is to adapt lifestyle changes as recommended by
Alzheimer's Association and CDC. Lack of exercise is one of the key lifestyle factors contributing to the risk of
AD. Reducing these modifiable risk factors could reduce AD prevalence. Autopsy studies show that as many
as 80% of individuals with AD also have cardiovascular disease. Exercise has been shown to have numerous
benefits in both cardiac and cognitive function, and may slowdown AD. However, more mechanistic studies are
needed to elucidate the effect of exercise on metabolic and vascular health of both the brain and heart in AD.
 Growing evidence suggests a close link between cardiovascular dysfunction and the AD progression.
Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Cardiovascular health
influences cerebral blood flow (CBF), and impaired blood flow to the brain can contribute to neurodegenerative
processes, including AD. Reduced cardiac function can lead to decreased oxygen supply to various organs,
including the brain, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired energy production, and increased oxidative
stress, which are also observed in AD. Echocardiography has been performed on 5xFAD and found a
significant reduction in cardiac ejection fraction compared to wild-type controls, but no report on cardiac
metabolism. There is a gap in our knowledge of the interplay between vascular and metabolic health of the
brain and heart in AD, how these key functions may be improved by routine exercise to slow down AD
progression, and any gender differences.
 In this pilot study, we will evaluate the feasibility of two non-invasive and translatable imaging techniques in
5xFAD AD model that rapidly recapitulates major features of AD amyloid pathology, with a moderate exercise
remedy over time to monitor their metabolic and vascular functions of the brain and heart associated with
amyloid pathogenesis. We will also investigate whether female and male mice benefit from exercise equally.
The techniques and multi-modal imaging proposed in this grant will allow us to probe how MRI can yield
metabolic and vascular information that may enable better classification, end points and mechanistic
understanding of the effect of exercise on AD and gender differences. These studies have direct translatable
value for human AD imaging research."

Organoids reproduce the complex differentiation, cell sorting and self-organization of organogenesis, enabling
the study of tissue development and modeling of organ physiology and disease ex vivo. The induced human
Pluripotent stem cell (ihPSC) derived organoids are on their way to revolutionizing the future of human
cell/organ transplantations. However, a major challenge is centered around the limited ability to control and
direct the dynamic process of self-organization at the cellular population level. This drawback diminishes our
engineering efforts to build reliable human tissues by mimicking natural biological processes. As such,
currently, human organoids exhibit (a) aberrant cell types and (b) stalled developmental stages (immaturity) (c)
limited robustness and reproducibility during multilineage tissue formation. In this proposal, we will harness the
power of synthetic and system biology and provide a framework to build next-generation organoids with
augmented performance and robustness for regenerative medicine. Our method is guided by computational
models and genetic technologies. We have recently discovered that in our liver organoids, GATA6-engineered
circuits can dictate final cell fates based on the initial GATA6 expression level. Here in Aim 1, we will establish
a clonally resolved engineering approach to build human organoids. We will use our library of genetically
engineered clones to rationally design mixtures of clones that exhibit specific quantitatively defined outcomes
at the tissue level and use this to augment and reconstitute mesodermal niche important for liver maturation.
The successful completion of this aim enables us to build human organoids with a high degree of
reproducibility. In Aim 2, we devise a computational platform to design and build organoid variants with defined
hepatic functions. The successful completion of this study will result in a hypothesis-driven framework for
rational engineering and advancement of stem cell-derived tissues ex vivo. Our study will also generate liver
tissues with close proximity to adult human liver and reduces dependence on animal experiments and
increases access to refined human tissues."

Malaria is a major public health burden, causing over a half million deaths and two hundred million
clinical episodes annually. During the pathogenic, asexual erythrocytic stage, the malaria parasite
scavenges the fatty acids (FA) it needs for lipid synthesis from the host’s plasma. This metabolic
requirement is a vulnerability that could be exploited to block parasite replication. Two parasite acyl-
Coenzyme A synthetases, ACS10 and 11, likely play key roles by activating fatty acids to acyl-CoA
thioesters, although little is known about their specific roles. Mutations in both enzymes have been
associated with resistance to anti-malarial compounds, with ACS10 shown to be a direct target, and
an ACS inhibitor is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials. Thus, a deeper understanding of the
roles of ACS10 and 11 could accelerate drug discovery efforts. We hypothesize that ACS10 and 11
each make important contributions to parasite FA uptake through distinctive specificities. In this
proposal, we will develop a new approach, termed “FA alkyne profiling”, for the systematic analysis of
FA uptake and lipid biosynthesis in P. falciparum and will employ it to gain insights into the roles and
specificities of ACS10 and 11 and the effects of ACS inhibition. In Aim 1, we will optimize FA alkyne
profiling in P. falciparum using six structurally-diverse fatty acid alkynes that together represent three-
quarters of P. falciparum fatty acids. Each FA alkyne probe will be validated in competition assays
with natural FAs and in parasite viability assays. These studies will provide a quantitative basis for
exploring the effects of perturbations in parasite fatty acid metabolism. In Aim 2, we will employ FA
alkyne probes to interrogate the physiological roles of ACS10 and 11. Parasite lines capable of
inducible knockdown of ACS10 or 11 will be profiled to establish the effects of enzyme depletion on
FA alkyne utilization. We will also use FA alkyne profiling to investigate the effects of two validated
ACS inhibitors with anti-malarial activity. These studies will provide insights into the physiological roles
of specific parasite ACSs and will establish a general framework for investigating he effects of
inhibition or knockdown of key lipid metabolic enzymes."

Currently, cardiovascular disease ranks as the leading cause of death in the United States. It is projected that
by 2035, over 130 million adults in the U.S. will have some form of cardiovascular disease. Vascular graft
technologies with patency rates equivalent to the clinical success of autologous grafting are lacking. Our goal is
to utilize novel biomaterial surface modifications and develop nucleic acid delivery technology to improve host-
biomaterial interactions with particular focus on the failure mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia resulting from
smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Previous work by our team has optimized surface characteristics
(physical topographies and biochemical modifications) to promote endothelialization without increasing
thrombosis. However, the addition of controlled therapeutic nucleic acid delivery with this proposal will address
intimal hyperplasia by directly altering smooth muscle cell phenotype. This work will develop the material surface
delivery techniques to alter host-biomaterial responses, which occur after graft implantation. Our use of poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) biomaterials is integral to these studies because it is a highly modifiable material; however, these
results can be readily translated to other modifiable off-the-shelf materials. Our aims are to: (1) develop nonviral
delivery of miR145 with surface- and sustained-release via nanoparticles complexed to our novel PVA-CDI
immobilized aminated fucoidan (PCAF) biomaterials, (2) characterize the effects of PCAF delivered miR145 on
vascular cell responses, including endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts and (3)
characterize the in vivo effects of PCAF-delivered miR145 on neointimal formation under healthy and diseased
states. Using PCAF with previously established topographies and surface chemistries known to support
endothelialization while maintaining hemocompatibility, we will utilize innovative gene delivery technologies in
conjunction with our clinically relevant animal models. These strict models have the potential to improve
translation by testing the material modifications in a whole, non-anticoagulated, flowing blood model of
thrombosis and a clinically relevant end-to-side model of vascular grafting implantation. The deliverables for this
project will include (1) efficient and sustainable delivery of miRNA-145 from our previously optimized PCAF to
smooth muscle cells (SMCs), (2) induction of the SMC contractile phenotype without causing endothelial
dysfunction, inflammation, or thrombosis, and (3) confirming a reduction of neointima formation in vivo without
harmful “off-target” effects or harmful accumulation in organs. The potential significance of this translational
project is the improved design of novel, functional biomaterial surfaces for cardiovascular applications. While we
are focused on vascular graft applications in this proposal, the principles of surface controlled responses can be
applied to multiple blood contacting devices. Our research will enable development and optimization of vascular
biomaterials for use in humans."
10892253,"Lung Transplantation is a vital therapeutic option for select individuals with end-stage lung disease, however
patient outcomes lag those for other solid organ transplants. The major early complication, primary graft
dysfunction (PGD), refers to acute lung injury occurring in the first 3-days posttransplant. Severe PGD has been
associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) or chronic rejection, the major limitation to long-term
survival among lung transplant recipients (LTRs). However, the epidemiologic and basic mechanisms that link
severe PGD to CLAD represent a significant knowledge gap in the field. This multi-PI proposal seeks to establish
an NIH Lung Transplant Consortium (LTC) Clinical Center (CC) between Pitt, UCSF and JHU to investigate the
epidemiologic and molecular impacts of severe PGD on acute cellular rejection (ACR) and allograft bacterial
infections, which are both risk factors for CLAD, along with one-year pulmonary function. This proposal tests the
hypothesis that PGD initiates a cycle of hypoxia and inflammation that drives ACR, infection, and impaired lung
function. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we will assess the distal airway transcriptome with airway brush samples
obtained at 3 time points during the first-year post transplant, to determine the molecular pathways by which
severe PGD impacts airway inflammation and pulmonary function. Dr. Merlo will direct Aim 1, which will
determine whether severe PGD grade 3 is a risk-factor for reduced peak FEV1, and increased ACR and allograft
bacterial infections in the first-year. Dr. Greenland will direct Aim 2, which will determine whether severe PGD is
associated with an airway hypoxia gene signature that predicts pulmonary function and infections in the first-
year. Dr. McDyer will direct Aim 3, which will determine whether severe PGD is associated with molecular
evidence of Type-1 inflammation and associated ACR. The multi-PIs have a strong history of collaboration
together, with synergistic expertise in clinical phenotyping of LTRs, transplant immunology, RNAseq analyses
and biostatistics/bioinformatics critical for the success of this project. Each CC site has an established research
program with mature lung transplant registries and biorepositories that include airway brushes and experienced
research coordinators, faculty, and personnel to advance the aims of this study and other LTC projects. This
LTC CC proposal is ideally suited to address both the key knowledge gaps identified above and bring state-of-
the-art capabilities to enhance the productivity of the LTC. Success in this project will advance the epidemiologic
and mechanistic insights into how severe PGD drives peak pulmonary function, and hypoxic and Type-1 immune
responses in the airway transcriptome during the first-year posttransplant. Together, this LTC CC project will
delineate novel biomarkers and key targetable pathways that will contribute to the diagnoses, treatment, and
potential future interventional studies to prevent post-transplant complications and advance the translational
science of lung transplant."
10892254,"Vertigo/disequilibrium is a frequent medical complaint for individuals with peripheral vestibular disorders or
after concussion, especially individuals with lengthy recovery periods. Concussion and vestibular disease often
result in vertigo/disequilibrium, abnormal eye movements, altered self-motion perception, and imbalance.
Degraded vestibular perception has recently been linked to balance problems. Despite existing therapies to
retrain balance and reflexive eye movements, little is known about the role that self-motion perception plays in
the recovery from persistent vertigo/disequilibrium or how to effectively re-train these abnormal perceptions.
 This career development award will establish Dr. Eric Anson as a clinician scientist with expertise in human
vestibular research including basic science ranging from physiology to perception and translational science to
enhance the care and quality of life for individuals experiencing chronic dizziness/vertigo. This K23 will ensure
Dr. Anson develops expertise in 3 primary domains: 1) Advanced concussion management training; 2)
Influence of cognition and emotion on SmP; and 3) statistical methods, perceptual psychophysics, and
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. Dr. Anson has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts in
concussion management (Jeffery Bazarian, MD, MPH), cognitive and emotional impacts on balance (Mark
Carpenter, PhD; Jeffery Staab, MD), vestibular adaptation (Michael Schubert, PT, PhD), and perceptual
psychophysics (Benjamin Crane, MD, PhD; Mark Carpenter, PhD; Jeremy Jamieson, PhD) to facilitate
achievement of his goals.
 Dr. Anson will conduct a series of studies to answer these important questions. He will investigate whether
different disease states (concussion and vestibular disease) with similar symptoms lead to differences in self-
motion perception (Aim 1). He will determine whether vestibular reflexes and vestibular self-motion perception
adapt independently (Aim 2). He will use balance-related anxiety at high heights to investigate the link between
emotional regulation, body sway, and self-motion perception (Aim 3). This research plan leverages unique
existing resources at the University of Rochester including the CTSI and equipment in the labs of Drs. Anson,
Crane, Bazarian, and Jamieson. Dr. Carpenter’s research lab provides access to unique resources for
exploring balance-related anxiety as a stressor and training methods to enhance self-motion perception. Dr.
Staab’s clinic and research lab provide access to unique resources for training in cognitive behavioral therapy
and patients with behavioral variables that contribute to persistent vertigo. The proposed training and mentored
research are consistent with the NIDCD strategic plan for research in hearing and balance, specifically
addressing current understanding of self-motion perception in health and disease. The proposed training will
be the foundation for future R01 applications using self-motion perceptual training to enhance current
vestibular rehabilitation, improving quality of life for individuals with vestibular disease or concussion."

Although radical cystectomy is often recommended for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), a well-tolerated
alternative called bladder-sparing trimodality therapy (TMT), consisting of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) follow-
ing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), has equivalent long-term outcomes to cystectomy while
preserving the patient’s native bladder. However, 20-30% of patients treated with TMT require a salvage cystec-
tomy due to recurrent disease, and there is an unmet need for molecular biomarkers to precisely identify appro-
priate candidates and to monitor for recurrences after therapy. We recently developed methods for the microflu-
idic isolation and molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood, which have potential
as non-invasive, serial “liquid biopsies” to predict and monitor therapeutic responses. Our long-term goal is to
develop predictive molecular biomarkers that can precisely guide the individualized care of patients with bladder
cancer. The overall objectives of this application are to (i) optimize CTC and tumor molecular signatures for the
prediction of therapeutic responses and longitudinal monitoring of patients treated with TMT, and (ii) to elucidate
molecular mechanisms of treatment resistance based on the evolution of CTC and tumor molecular profiles after
CRT. Our central hypothesis is that CTC molecular signatures, in combination with tumor molecular profiles, can
predict and monitor therapeutic responses after bladder preservation therapy in patients with MIBC. The rationale
for this project is that the development of molecular biomarkers will enable the tailored selection of therapy and
accurate monitoring of treatment response for MIBC patients. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Identify pretreatment CTC molecular signatures that, combined with tumor molecular
profiles, correlate with prognosis after TMT; 2) Identify CTC molecular signatures to monitor for early detection
of recurrence after TMT; and 3) Evaluate dynamic changes in CTC and tumor molecular profiles before and after
TMT to elucidate mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. In the first aim, we will optimize pretreatment CTC and
tumor predictive signatures in MIBC patients undergoing TMT, followed by validation in MIBC patients enrolled
in the SWOG/NRG 1806 clinical trial. In the second aim, we will optimize a CTC RNA signature for early detection
of recurrence after TMT in a cohort of MIBC patients, followed by validation in patients enrolled in SWOG/NRG
1806. In the third aim, we will analyze CTC and tumor transcriptional profiles collected longitudinally from TMT
patients who develop recurrent disease to identify molecular signatures associated with therapeutic resistance.
The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will develop novel molecular assays based on
the microfluidic isolation and RNA expression profiling of CTCs in bladder cancer patients. The proposed re-
search is significant because it will yield clinically useful biomarkers for the precise selection of patients appro-
priate for bladder-sparing TMT and the non-invasive monitoring of these patients, while also advancing our un-
derstanding of molecular determinants of response and resistance to CRT in bladder cancer."

While relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) can effectively be managed by a pantheon of disease
modifying drugs with anti-inflammatory activities, the transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is met with
refractoriness to therapeutics and a downward spiral of neurodegeneration. This dire scenario has called into
question the role of inflammation in SPMS, and cast SPMS treatment as a pressing unmet clinical need!
However, meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissues (mELTs), which appear during SPMS in pathognomonic fashion,
could drive atypical inflammatory activity and provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention. These
indeterminate structures are B cell-rich aggregates that accumulate in the subarachnoid space of the meninges,
and resemble tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) observed elsewhere in the body during various autoimmune and
infectious conditions. In both MS patients and animal models, mELTs are conspicuously located over activated
sub-pial microglia in areas of extensive cortical demyelination and neuronal loss, raising speculation they rain
down as yet unknown incendiary factors that spark “compartmentalized inflammation” and neurodegeneration.
Their role in SPMS etiopathogenesis nevertheless remains ambiguous, as the composition,
compartmentalization, and gene expression of the varied cell types comprising mELTs have not been evaluated
in relation to disease status and locale along the CNS axis – factors that can significantly impact the meninges
and, thus, potentially mELTs. Technical hurdles had precluded examining these issues, but methodological
advances by this group now allow for interrogation of mELTs – histologically and transcriptionally – within their
native meningeal habitat. Two broad Aims are thus proposed to fill these major gaps, and test the hypothesis
The cellular composition, organization and gene expression of meningeal Ectopic Lymphoid Tissues
(mELTs) depend on CNS locale and disease status. Aim 1 will analyze animals at early and late stages of
secondary progressive disease, and characterize the cell composition of mELTs in brain and spinal cord.
Emphasis will be placed on identifying immune, stromal cell and vascular cell types found in known TLOs, and
detailing their 3D organization with respect to each other and meningeal elements. Attention to meninges will
be critical, as meningeal trabeculae might nucleate mELT assembly and/or segregate mELT cells into functional
domains. High-resolution, 3D fluorescence microscopy and immuno-scanning electron microscopy will be used
to view mELT cell organization at the light microscopic and ultrastructural levels, respectively, and imaging mass
cytometry to reveal the full repertoire of cells in context with meningeal structures. Aim 2 will dissect the
respective transcriptomes of the different mELT cell populations in brain and spinal cord in situ during early and
late disease, using laser capture microdissection coupled to RNA-seq to preserve context-dependent gene
expression patterns. This deliberative and methodical spatiotemporal analysis will yield foundational information
necessary for resolving the contribution of mELTs to SPMS and highlighting new therapeutic prospects."

This project focuses on the development of treatment to combat giardiasis resistance to standard care drugs.
Giardia lamblia is a highly infective waterborne parasite that causes severe diarrhea. Current antigiardiasis drugs
fail in about 20% of cases, and they all have undesirable side effects. Additionally, drug-resistant G. lamblia
strains can be readily raised in the laboratory, increasing the risk of this category B bioterrorism organism.
Chronic infection of giardiasis and lack of treatment in developing countries lead to malnutrition, growth
retardation in children, and death. Thus, the prevalence of giardiasis impacts global health profoundly, and the
World Health Organization has included giardiasis in its Neglected Diseases Initiative.
Our collaborators and NCATS/NIH investigators identified fumagillin as a lead compound through screening an
approved drug library. Fumagillin kills Giardia trophozoites in vitro with high potency via MetAP2 inhibition. It has
also shown excellent efficacy in an in vivo mouse model; however, it has two liabilities: heat and humidity
instability, as well as potential toxicity in humans. These liabilities hamper the further development of fumagillin.
We addressed these issues during our lead optimization process and identified PTLS-209, which has high
potency for MetAP2, low bioavailability, improved efficacy, and enhanced stability. Thus, PTLS-209 has the ideal
attributes to be an effective and safe intestinal targeting drug for treating giardiasis, particularly drug-resistant
giardiasis.
The arsenal of drugs available for treating giardiasis belongs to only a few chemical classes, primarily
nitroimidazoles, thiazolides, and benzimidazoles. G. lamblia drug resistance already exists for each of these
classes of compounds. None of the currently used drugs to treat giardiasis act on the MetAP2 enzyme. Thus,
PTLS-209, a fumagillin analog, will not be subject to the current drug resistance mechanisms that result in
treatment failures.
PTLS-209 has an excellent safety profile, while other analogs of the fumagillin class, beloranib, ZGN-1061, and
ZGN-1258, have shown adverse effects in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Note that these analogs were
administered subcutaneously, whereas PTLS-209 is administered orally and has a very low oral bioavailability
in mice (which may be the cause of its low toxicity). In order to mitigate the risks early, we have adopted the “Fail
Early, Fail Cheap” approach. We propose two critical tests to evaluate these toxicity concerns in our SBIR Phase
I portion of the Fast-Track application. Once we meet our Phase I milestones, we will continue IND-enabling
studies to ensure that PTLS-209 has all the attributes to be a successful treatment for giardiasis and will file an
IND application."

infant’s diet); however, many communities lack access to IBCLCs. Racial and ethnic minority mothers have
lower breastfeeding rates, and limited access to professional lactation support may contribute to this disparity.
Virtual “telelactation” consults that use two-way video have the potential to increase access to IBCLCs among
underserved populations. Telelactation is convenient because it does not require a new mother to travel with
her infant and can be provided on demand. Telelactation is also less costly than an in-person visit. Since 2015,
several companies have begun to offer telelactation through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, where women
initiate video calls with providers using their personal devices (e.g., mobile phones); however, no published
research has linked telelactation with breastfeeding outcomes. To address this evidence gap, we will expand on
a successful pilot study that demonstrated the feasibility and perceived value of telelactation in a rural
community, and conduct an innovative “siteless” randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of DTC
telelactation on breastfeeding outcomes. We will recruit 2400 primiparous pregnant women age >18 who plan
to breastfeed and live in the 17 states most underserved by IBCLCs. Recruitment will occur via Ovia, a popular
pregnancy tracker mobile phone application. Women will be randomized to: 1) on-demand telelactation video
calls on personal devices or 2) usual care. Quantitative data on breastfeeding rates, as well as qualitative data
on experiences with telelactation, will be captured via surveys and in-depth interviews and compared across
racial and ethnic groups. The specific aims are: 1) Assess the impact of DTC telelactation breastfeeding
duration and exclusivity, compare effectiveness by race/ethnicity and rural/urban location, and explore
whether self-efficacy serves as an explanatory mechanism; 2) Explore how acceptability of and experiences
with telelactation vary across subpopulations of mothers. This research aims to improve children’s health and
reduce disparities in key maternal and child health outcomes. It will also inform the design and execution of
future siteless trials among pregnant and postpartum women to enhance minority participation in research
and reduce the time and resources required to surface evidence on the impacts of new eHealth interventions.
Study results will inform policy debates about reimbursement of telelactation and will identify strategies to
further tailor these services to meet the needs and preferences of racial and ethnic minority women."

Breastfeeding offers many medical and neurodevelopmental advantages for mothers and infants; however, the

milk at six months of age. Professional lactation support by International Board Certified Lactation

10892315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related
quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve
HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations
themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely
encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the
patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack
of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate
those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to
characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support
personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99
phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze
symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol
created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct
a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about
ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in
patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid
visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the
decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering
competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The
long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent
program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to
improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular
conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training
activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs
of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be
conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing
technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and
innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to
SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for
other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions.

10892465,"Project Summary/Abstract
Perception of ecologically relevant visual stimuli such as faces and bodies is achieved through
two processing streams extending from early visual cortex (EVC) to lateral occipito-temporal
cortex (LOTC) and ventral temporal cortex (VTC), respectively. However, if and how the
underlying microstructure and white matter connections constrain the functional organization
and support neural computations in these visual streams remains poorly understood.
Leveraging advancements achieved in the prior funding period, we propose a unique
multimodal approach, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), quantitative
MRI (qMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), anatomical quantification, and innovative computational
modeling to elucidate how structural factors constrain the functional organization of LOTC and
VTC. The research has three main aims. Aim 1 will test a quantitative model of functional-
anatomical correspondence in high-level visual cortex. Using fMRI, analysis of micro- and
macro-structure, the research will quantify the correspondence between macroanatomical
landmarks, cytoarchitecture, and functional regions in LOTC and VTC. Aim 2 will determine
how white matter connections regulate the functional organization of high-level visual
cortex. Using dMRI and fMRI this aim will test (i) if different white matter connections from EVC
to downstream regions contribute to the segregation of functional regions within and across
visual streams, and (ii) if the eccentricity of the origin of these white matter connections impacts
the visual field coverage of downstream regions. Aim 3 will develop and test a
spatiotemporal population receptive field model of responses in visual cortex. This aim
will provide not only an innovative approach using fMRI and computational modeling to predict
responses to a large range of stimuli that vary in size, position, timing, and duration, but will also
provide a quantitative framework to test the impact of top-down attention on basic visual
computations. Overall, the proposed research will significantly advance understanding of high-
level vision by filling in longstanding gaps in knowledge. The research will (1) provide a
parsimonious model of how the microstructure and connections scaffold the function and
computations of both ventral and lateral streams, (2) break new ground in computational models
of visual cortex, and (3) generate innovative multimodal in vivo methods to quantify
microstructural properties of visual cortex. Together, the research has important implications for
clinical conditions that are associated with malfunction of high-level vision including
developmental prosopagnosia, autism, and dyslexia."

patients with metastatic disease is critically needed; however, there is a dearth of literature on this topic. Within
the Asian American population, Confucian-heritage East Asian and Southeast Asian ethnic groups share
cultural values and norms relevant to tailoring cancer care, and a goal of the K99 phase is to generate mixed-
methods data on supportive care needs specifically for Chinese-, Vietnamese-, and Korean-descent (CVK)
patients with metastatic cancer. Findings from the K99 phase will be shared with research participants and
applied collaboratively to develop culturally relevant supportive care resources in the R00 phase. The overall
training objective of this Early K99/R00 is to provide Dr. Kim with additional years of mentorship to become a
highly qualified independent investigator at the intersection of culture and supportive oncology. Training goals
include developing competencies in: 1) patient/family-centered and stakeholder-engaged cancer care
research, 2) patient-reported outcomes, needs, and preferences in metastatic cancer, 3) advanced mixed-
methods research particularly for working with non-English speaking participants, and 4) psychosocial
intervention development in cancer. Through the proposed training, Dr. Kim’s background in qualitative and
quantitative research, culturally-grounded research in Asian American populations, and cancer-related coping
processes will be integrated to solidify expertise in mixed methods and cultural implications for
psychosocial/behavioral cancer control as she transitions into an independent tenure-track faculty position.
During the K99 phase, Dr. Kim will be under the primary mentorship of Dr. Annette Stanton at UCLA, alongside
a strong co-mentorship team of experts (Drs. Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, Qian Lu, Anna Lau) committed to
advancing Dr. Kim’s career. The proposed research will also document participants’ reflections about the

10864684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The lack of a noninvasive, cost-effective, and highly accessible technology for monitoring cerebral metabolic rate
of oxygen (CMRO2) poses a critical gap in neurology and brain health. Current methods, including positron
emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffuse optical tomography, and catheter-based
jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring, have limitations such as radiation exposure, invasiveness, limited
spatial and temporal resolution, and reduced accessibility. This project aims to address this unmet need by
developing the next-generation photoacoustic computed tomography through an ergodic relay (PACTER) device
for noninvasive CMRO2 monitoring. In Aim 1, the device will be designed and fabricated to enable high-resolution
vascular imaging of oxygen metabolism. This will involve integrating an acoustic impedance-matching layer,
using longer-wavelength illumination for improved spatial resolution and penetration depth for imaging the carotid
artery and internal jugular vein, and employing dual-wavelength illumination for quantifying total hemoglobin
concentration and oxygen saturation. Additionally, blood flow will be measured using photoacoustic vector
tomography. The device will be customized for handheld operation, ensuring easy access to imaging regions. In
Aim 2, the next-generation PACTER device will be characterized and validated for monitoring CMRO2 in humans.
Imaging performance, accuracy, and sensitivity will be assessed using tissue-simulating phantoms, animal
models, healthy volunteers, and patients with neurological conditions. By measuring relevant parameters in the
carotid artery and internal jugular vein, including blood volume, hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation,
and blood flow, the device will enable the calculation of oxygen extraction and CMRO2. Comparisons with
existing methods, such as fMRI, will be conducted, setting the stage for future clinical validation studies. The
proposed research addresses the significant gap in noninvasive CMRO2 monitoring and offers transformative
advancements. The development of the next-generation PACTER device will facilitate personalized diagnostics
and care for neurology, neurosurgery, and critical care patients. It will provide timely and crucial information for
accurate diagnosis, treatment guidance, and surgical decision-making, ultimately leading to improved medical
outcomes and quality of life. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of PACTER will contribute to
reducing the overall cost of medical care and benefit researchers in the field. The project's innovation lies in the
creation of a highly accessible device with label-free, non-ionizing, and high-spatiotemporal-resolution imaging
capabilities, overcoming the limitations of current CMRO2 monitoring techniques. In summary, the next-
generation PACTER device offers a novel approach to noninvasive CMRO2 monitoring, addressing a critical gap
in the field. This research will facilitate progress towards significant improvements in brain health assessment,
personalized diagnostics, and intraoperative monitoring, ultimately advancing our understanding of brain function
and improving patient outcomes."

Ototoxicity is a common side effect of platinum-based chemotherapy that leads to significant negative health and
psychosocial consequences among adult cancer survivors (Miaskowski et al. 2018; Dillard et al. 2022).
Prospectively monitoring patients with cancer for early signs of ototoxicity provides the opportunity to mitigate its
adverse effects when the oncologist is able to modify drug treatment, and/or the audiologist can deliver timely
rehabilitation (ASHA 1994; AAA 2009). Unfortunately, significant barriers exist to integrating audiology supportive
services into oncologic care. Principal among these are barriers related to care and referral coordination with
oncology, audiology workload, and lack of protocols. Development of interventions is further hampered by
uncertain pathophysiology and variable patient susceptibility to ototoxicity, particularly as it relates to the
development of tinnitus and difficulties understanding speech in noise. The result is that ototoxicity management
(OtoM) as delivered currently in VA is elective care that occurs sporadically and fails to inform the patient’s
ototoxicity risk stratification, oncologic treatment or survivorship plan (Konrad-Martin et al. 2021, 2023).
The objectives of Dr. Konrad-Martin’s program of research are to: (i) construct tools to forecast individual patient
susceptibility to ototoxic hearing loss and tinnitus; (ii) test new hypotheses developed in animal models, about
the cochlear changes that trigger tinnitus and temporal processing problems in humans; and (iii) characterize
ototoxicity and OtoM from the perspectives of the patient and provider. For this research, patients receiving
cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin are providing behavioral and physiological measures of auditory function
before, during, and after treatment. A subset contribute a blood sample for a genetic association pilot study.
i. Forecasting model development. We have developed a prognostic model to mathematically transform the
patient’s personal and treatment features into the expected post-treatment audiogram, which can be expressed
on a variety of measurement scales to address the clinical concern for patients, audiologists and oncologists
(McMillan et al. in progress). Into this model, we have incorporated population-based data from unexposed
controls on normal test-retest variability in pure tone thresholds. For Dr. Konrad-Martin’s SPiRE, model predictors
additionally include the presence and numbers of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms within four genes
selected for their potential association with cisplatin ototoxicity, including: ACYP2 (Xu et al., 2015); COMT
(Hagleitner et al., 2014); TPMT (Ross et al., 2009); and TRPV1 (Jiang et al., 2019).
ii. Relating ototoxic symptoms to the underlying auditory injury. A combination of wideband acoustic reflex (AR)
amplitude growth (Westman et al., 2021), and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels is being
used to distinguish damage to the cochlear afferent system from outer hair cell dysfunctio n to determine the
extent to which tinnitus, speech understanding deficits, and reduced benefit from temporally-based spatial cues
can be attributed to cochlear injury, after controlling for cognitive function. Results are examined at one month
and one year after the initial chemotherapy treatment to allow for neuroplasticity within the central auditory
pathways (Kaltenbach et al. 1998, 2001; Chambers et al. 2016).
(iii) Characterize patient and provider perspectives on ototoxicity and OtoM. Patient and provider perspectives
on ototoxicity and OtoM are necessary to determine high value aspects of OtoM and barriers to care. Patient-
centered rating scales and questionnaires are being used to obtain the patient’s perspective on ototoxicity and
OtoM. We surveyed 63 VA audiologists and 12 VA oncologists nationally regarding their views on OtoM and
barriers to care. These results, together with completed work indicate that although OtoM has been
recommended for patients receiving cisplatin, carboplatin, or chemoradiation to mitigate ototoxicity, OtoM is at
best underutilized in VA (Konrad-Martin et al. 2021, 2023)."
10867527,"ABSTRACT
The long term goal of our research is to understand the computational role of mental imagery in
human cognition, and to operationalize this understanding to provide new tools for improving
mental health. For most people, mental imagery is experienced as visual content that is
independent of vision but indispensable for thought. This experience suggests that mental
imagery serves an important cognitive function; however, studies of the brain systems that
generate mental imagery have yet to reveal how or if mental images contribute to cognition. In
this proposal, we test the hypothesis that mental imagery supports cognition by permitting the
comparison of seen to unseen images. The comparison of seen and unseen images is a routine
operation that occurs, for example, when one judges how a seen image differs from a
remembered image, or from a target image that one wants to detect. To test this hypothesis we
will measure brain activity in people as they imagine and as they complete a variety of tasks that
require them to compare pictures displayed on a screen to pictures that they have been asked
to remember. Using techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence (AI) we will extract from
these data information about individual mental images, and then determine if this information
can predict brain activity and behavior during the tasks. If successful, this proposal will establish
a functional and computational role for imagery. Since very little is currently known about the
function of mental imagery, our work is an essential step toward understanding how mental
imagery interacts with and supports cognition, and how disregulated mental imagery can disrupt
mental health."
10864137,"Drug use among older adults has increased sharply over the past decade. The combination of the aging and
increasing use of psychoactive drugs, including misuse of prescription psychotropic medications, creates a
growing public health problem with rising numbers of older adults at risk for experiencing harm from drug use.
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that older adults are more susceptible to the harms of drug use due to
age-associated physiological changes, social factors such as increased isolation, increases in comorbidity, and
use of medications that may interact with other drugs. There is a lack of reliable estimates of drug use among
older adults that may contribute to the perception that they do not engage in use, making them less likely to be
screened for use. As such, we believe the prevalence of drug use among older adults is underestimated. More
focused surveys assessing drug use aimed at older adults are needed. Additionally, intentional and
unintentional underreporting of drug use remains common across populations. Combining surveys with
biological testing could detect underreporting and unintentional exposure to drugs, and this combination can
also be used to adjust estimates of use. Thus, assessing drug use through surveys plus biological testing will
provide important information that informs how both researchers and clinicians screen and address drug use in
this population. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive expertise in drug use epidemiology among older
adults, survey design, population sampling, and advanced toxicology testing. We will administer a rapid drug
survey to query use of ~100 illegal drugs and a variety of prescription psychoactive drugs in 300 adults aged
≥65 in New York City. We will calculate the prevalence of use of a wide variety of drugs and assess the value
of adding saliva testing and hair testing to the survey. We will apply a targeted street intercept sampling
approach to reach diverse older populations often overlooked by national surveys, including people
experiencing homelessness. We can test exposure to >1,000 drugs including over 100 fentanyl analogs. The
aims of this project are to: 1) determine if and to what extent saliva and hair testing add to the prevalence of
self-reported drug use, 2) delineate risk factors for testing positive for exposure after not reporting use
(discordant report) and deduce the extent to which discordant report is from unknown adulterant exposure vs.
misreporting, and 3) characterize use of cannabis and other illegal drugs in terms of reasons for use, route(s)
of administration, and whether adverse effects (including substance use disorder) have resulted from use. This
interdisciplinary research spanning aging research and drug use epidemiology will inform public health
responses and improve age-friendly health systems to address the increase in psychoactive drug use and its
adverse health effects among older adults. This study will not only inform how researchers and clinicians
screen and address psychoactive drug use, but these methods will inform more largescale epidemiology
studies estimating drug use and associated effects in this population overlooked in drug use epidemiology."
10864213,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., those with same-sex partners or attractions, or identify as lesbian, gay, or
bisexual) are subjected to stigma and discrimination. They also disproportionately experience poverty, sexual
violence, and limited access to high-quality reproductive healthcare (including family planning services). As a
result, SMW may have higher rates of unintended pregnancies than their heterosexual peers. Particular sub-
groups of SMW may suffer from greater disparities. First, SMW who are racial/ethnic minorities may experi-
ence greater disparities than white SMW due to their multiple marginalization. Second, SMW who live in states
with restrictive policies—including those related to reproductive health (e.g., abortion/contraception) or discrimi-
nation (reflective of sexism/heterosexism)—may experience greater disparities due to having less access to
reproductive healthcare and greater exposure to discrimination. Furthermore, as access to abortion is re-
stricted, especially post-Dobbs, more unintended pregnancies will be carried to term, and thus, increasing risk
for adverse perinatal outcomes. However, we do not know the extent to which state-level reproductive health
and discriminatory policies impact SMW, particularly those who are racial/ethnic minorities. This project will use
longitudinal data from the Growing Up Today Study (N=15,044) and Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N>51,094, open
cohort) to investigate the sexual orientation-related disparities in unintended pregnancies and resulting adverse
perinatal outcomes (Aim 1) and quantify the intersectional disparities in these outcomes among those doubly
minoritized by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity (Aim 2). I will also determine the extent to which state-level
reproductive health (abortion/contraception) and discriminatory (sexist/heterosexist) policies modify these dis-
parities, and the extent to which individual-level experiences of violence and discrimination ameliorate or exac-
erbate policy impacts (Aim 3). This work is timely as reproductive health policies have become more polarized
since the Dobbs decision, and discriminatory policies impacting SMW have dramatically increased. This work
is also innovative because the geographic spread of participants and ~30 years of ongoing follow-up will allow
me to examine impacts of policy changes over a long time period, how changes in sexual orientation identity
impacts changes in disparities, and how moving to more or less restrictive states impacts unintended pregnan-
cies among SMW. This award aligns with NICHD’s scientific priority to understand the impacts of reproductive
health policy changes in an NIH health disparities population, SMW. I will obtain advanced training in intersec-
tionality and policy surveillance methods. This training and research will be critical for helping me build an inde-
pendent career in quantifying how policies and structures affect reproductive health outcomes and reproductive
agency. The proposed research is an essential next step towards (1) identifying particular harmful policies for
policy change, (2) elucidating the mechanisms by which state policies affect unintended pregnancies and their
outcomes among SMW, and (3) laying the foundation for similar research in other stigmatized populations."
10864214,"Pressure injury (PrI) prevention remains a major challenge over the long term for Veterans with impaired
mobility, in particular those with spinal cord injury (SCI). PrI limit activities of daily living, often leading to
prolonged bedrest, hospitalization and even death. Clinical practice guidelines recommend weight-shifting
every 20 minutes for persons with SCI, which is impractical when busy with activities of daily living. We have
previously shown that long term use of dynamic gluteal intermittent stimulation (iGSTIM) using percutaneous
electrodes and an external stimulator effectively provides an extra means of weight shifting, improves local
blood flow, increases muscle size and reduces the incidence of tissue breakdown, specifically pressure
injuries. User feedback was that long-term use of iGSTIM meant they no longer worried about recurrent skin
problems requiring significant periods of bedrest. Furthermore, daily use of the system was easy and fit well in
to their activities of daily living. However, continued usage is necessary to sustain improvements in tissue
health and the need to keep percutaneous lead exit sites covered and regularly cleaned became arduous over
time. Users requested a fully implanted iGSTIM for regular weight shifting and PrI prevention.
Our team has been contacted many times over the years by individuals asking for a system that could be
entirely implanted. Other prevention methods these individuals tried have failed and they are desperate for a
new alternative. We have therefore developed the flexSTIM biomimetic implantable pulse generator (IPG).
Prior funding synergized recent advances in flexible hybrid electronics, additive manufacturing and packaging
with our prior clinical findings to provide initial development and testing of the flexSTIM IPG laying the
foundation for translation and clinical implementation in persons with SCI. Combined with industry-standard
intramuscular electrodes, the VA-patented flexSTIM IPG is a novel technology that proactively addresses the
issues of decreased muscle quality and the long-term need for regular weight-shifting for persons with limited
mobility, in particular Veterans with SCI. This small flexible 2-4 channel system meets the end user need for
straightforward automated weight-shifting and can be initiated daily at the touch of a button. flexSTIM is
designed to be inserted into a subcutaneous pocket through a 1” incision, with the whole iGSTIM system
implemented as an outpatient procedure.
The overall goal of this TRRA-1 planning grant is to complete review of technical merit of the research
completed to date together with evaluating the further testing proposed, in order to assemble the detailed
documentation necessary for a pre-IDE (Q-Sub) meeting with the FDA on the iGSTIM system including
implanted flexSTIM Class III IPG and intramuscular electrodes with an external (primary) coil. Specific activities
will include: Management of regulatory tasks including regulatory file maintenance and Master file ratification
together with review of further in-vivo testing so that the FDA can provide clear guidance on the preclinical
testing needed for the IDE submission. The conditionally approved IRB protocol proposed under the requested
IDE will also be reviewed. The current study design would evaluate whether use of the fully implanted iGSTIM
system using the flexSTIM IPG to deliver neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the buttocks provides reliable
regular weight shifting and improves the health of the muscles over time in 10 Veterans with SCI. The initial
pre-IDE meeting will be scheduled during the third quarter of the planning grant. The fully implanted iGSTIM
system has enormous potential to enhance health and quality of life for Veterans with SCI."

Title: The role of Septin6 Group in Murine and Human Hematopoiesis
1 R01 DK137172-01
Septins are highly conserved GTPase proteins which regulate a variety of cellular functions including cytokinesis, polarity, cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, exocytosis, and creation of diffusion barriers. We have recently identified a non-syndromic newborn with severe neutropenia (Renella, AJH 2022) with a novel X-linked germline mutation in the C-terminus of SEPTIN6 gene (SEPTIN6 c.1282T>C p.428Glnext*9) associated with dysmyelopoiesis. Editing the germline mutation into normal male CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/P) phenocopied key pathologic features of the clinical syndrome, including large, multinucleated nuclei and reduced myeloid progenitor growth in vitro (preliminary data). The C-terminus has been proposed to play a key role in filament stabilization, bundling and bending as well as interactions with other septins and in silico modeling suggest the addition of 9 amino acids (aa) associated with the SEPTIN6 c.1282T>C p.428Glnext*9 mutation would alter function by interfering with SEPTIN6 protein interactions. Based on our initial publication, a second patient with severe neutropenia has since been identified in Seattle with a distinct mutation in the same codon (SEPTIN6 c.1282T>A) (Mohamad, Allensbach, Williams, accepted for presentation, ASH 2022). While the aa substitution is different, modeling predicts that SEPTIN6 variants adopt the same structure. Both identified patients had a high degree of myeloid tetraploidy in the marrow and were refractory to G-CSF."

B cells are a central player in the humoral immune response, which is elicited by differentiated, antibody-
producing B cell-types known as plasma cells (PCs). During viral infections such as influenza or SARS-CoV2,
PCs produce antibodies that neutralize viral activity. Furthermore, PCs have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of many autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, the capacity to modulate B cell function,
notably PC differentiation and activity, has broad clinical implications. The leading therapy for specific regulation
of B cell function is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, leading to brash depletion of virtually all B cell subsets
and resulting in various side effects. Thus, there is a clinical need for molecular targets that affect B cell function
in more refined and precise manners.
Ion channels and transporters (ICTs) mediate the flux of ions across the lipid bilayer, which can further regulate
intracellular signaling. ICTs are desirable clinical targets because 1) many are surface proteins accessible to
biologics and 2) multiple small-molecule ICT modulators have already been developed. Unfortunately, though
substantive evidence exists that different ICTs can contribute to different aspects of B function, this intersection
remains poorly investigated. To address this gap, I will leverage transcriptomic analyses and functional
genomics, coupled with experimental validations. Based on an RNA-seq and a CRISPR screen, I came across
SLC4A7, a Na+/HCO3- co-transporter known to regulate intracellular pH. Deletion of SLC4A7 in B cells selectively
impaired PC differentiation in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1, I will further characterize how SLC4A7 affects PC
differentiation signaling pathways, intracellular pH, and the autophagy pathway. In Aim 2, I will determine how
deletion of SLC4A7 in B cells affects the immune response against influenza infection as well as the
pathogenesis of a murine model for MS. Overall, this project will elucidate novel mechanisms by which
intracellular pH regulates PC differentiation and reveal a novel target (SLC4A7) with which B cell function
can be modulated, especially in the context of MS."

 The overall objective of this research is to develop statistical methods for quantifying the effects of interventions
to prevent infectious diseases. The primary motivating examples for this research are studies of vaccines, although
the developed methods will be general and have immediate application in other settings. One particularly significant
and challenging problem in vaccine studies entails assessing indirect (spillover) effects of vaccination. For vaccines
that are costly or do not afford complete protection from disease when an individual is vaccinated, evaluating indirect
effects (or herd immunity) is important in policy considerations about vaccine introduction and utilization. Failure to
account for herd immunity can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the public health benefit of a vaccine. Drawing
inference about herd immunity is non-standard because indirect effects measure the effect of vaccinating one
individual on another individual's health outcome. In the nomenclature of causal inference, this is known as
“interference.” That is, interference is said to be present if the treatment (e.g., vaccination) of one individual affects
the outcome of another individual. In this grant innovative statistical methods will be developed for drawing inference
about the effects of a treatment or exposure when there is possibly interference between individuals. For each of
the project's aims, the theoretical properties of the proposed statistical methods will be established. Simulation
studies will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods over a wide range of realistic
settings. The developed methods will be used to analyze data from several large infectious disease prevention
studies, providing new insights into the different effects of vaccines for cholera, influenza, and other pathogens, and
malaria bed nets. The resulting inferences will have straightforward interpretations in terms of the expected number
of infections or cases of disease averted due to the intervention. User-friendly software implementing the proposed
methods will be developed and made freely available. The statistical methods and software developed will be
applicable to many other settings where interference may be present, including econometrics, education, network
analysis, political science, and spatial analyses."
10876918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Low back pain represents a significant health care burden in the United States and accounts for nearly four
million emergency department (ED) visits per year. In nearly two thirds of these visits, an opioid medication is
administered or prescribed, making low back pain the most common reason for which opioids are prescribed.
Despite this aggressive medication-based approach, patient outcomes after an ED visit for back pain remain
poor: after three months, nearly half of all patients report persistent functional impairment, and one in five
patients report continued opioid use. Additionally, low back pain continues to be a major driver of unnecessary
diagnostic imaging. Nearly one in three ED visits for low back pain results in a plain radiograph, despite
multiple professional society guidelines advising against routine imaging.
ED-initiated physical therapy (ED-PT) is a promising new resource to improve patient care for low back pain.
A growing number of EDs now have dedicated physical therapists that can be consulted to evaluate and treat
patients through a combination of education, anticipatory guidance, and early mobilization and exercise. Our
preliminary data indicate that patients receiving ED-PT, compared to usual care, report more rapid functional
improvement, use fewer opioids, and receive less diagnostic imaging. However, these observational data are
limited by biases in treatment selection due to physician discretion in which patients receive ED-PT, as well as
other measured and unmeasured confounders.
To more rigorously evaluate the efficacy of ED-PT for acute low back pain, we propose (Aim 1) to develop a
revised model of ED-PT in which the physical therapist is “embedded” within the primary ED treatment team
to evaluate all patients with acute low back pain early in the overall treatment course: the Northwestern
Embedded Emergency Department Physical Therapy (NEED-PT) protocol. We will then (Aim 2) conduct a
physician-randomized trial of NEED-PT versus usual care (i.e., no physical therapy) in ED patients with acute
low back pain, comparing a primary outcome of patient-reported functioning and a secondary outcome of
opioid use at the primary endpoint of three months. Finally, we will (Aim 3) compare diagnostic imaging
utilization among ED back pain visits receiving NEED-PT versus usual care. We hypothesize that patients
receiving NEED-PT will experience greater improvement in functioning and lower use of opioids, and that ED
visits with NEED-PT will utilize less diagnostic imaging. The findings generated from this research have the
potential to meaningfully mitigate the current reliance on opioids for low back pain. As such, we believe this
proposal is both timely and responsive to the ARHQ Special Emphasis Notice on Health Services Research to
Address the Opioids Crisis (NOT-HS-18-015)."

Hypertension (HT) in youth tracks into adulthood, contributing to adult cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HT in children and adolescents were last updated in
2017, with definitions for HT that vary by age. To date, most children and adolescents with elevated blood
pressure (BP) or HT are not diagnosed or inadequately treated. Factors that contribute to these deficits in care
include: the need to translate pediatric BP measures into BP percentiles, lack of clinician familiarity with
pediatric HT guidelines, and competing demands at clinical encounters.
Electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) can be used to address these barriers
and improve the identification and management of elevated BP and HT in children and adolescents. With
funding from NHLBI, our team developed, implemented, and evaluated a sophisticated web-based, EHR-linked
CDS to provide patient-specific clinical care recommendations in real time and in accordance with national
guidelines for BP management in youth. In a 2-year cluster randomized trial in 20 urban and suburban primary
care clinics in an integrated health system in Minnesota, we demonstrated that our CDS increased repeat
measurement of elevated BP during a visit and more than doubled clinician recognition of HT, while promoting
dietitian referrals and additional next steps in care consistent with national guidelines. The CDS system was
well accepted by providers and as such, is now standard of care in 55 primary care and 17 subspecialty clinics
serving children across our health system. Implementation of this CDS, now referred to as Peds & TeenBP, in
a new health system is a logical next step, yet optimal strategies for adaptation and implementation of CDS in
clinics serving rural populations have not been well described.
In the current proposal, we will implement Peds & TeenBP in a large health system with many clinics located in
rural regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. In order to compare approaches to implementation of
Peds & TeenBP to usual care, we will randomly assign 15 primary care clinics to receive high-intensity
implementation (CDS with online and in-person training, and audit-feedback), 15 clinics to receive low-intensity
implementation (CDS with online training only), and 15 clinics will continue with usual care (no CDS). Primary
outcomes are repeat BP measurement and HT recognition. Secondary outcomes include management of HT
and BP control at 12-month follow-up. As rural children face reduced access to pediatric subspecialists, tools
such as Peds & TeenBP are needed. The proposed comparison of high-intensity and low-intensity approaches
to implementation, with a focus on delivery of a new intervention in a rural healthcare setting, is consistent with
AHRQ’s research priorities in providing meaningful decision support while increasing evidence to support
adoption across a health system."
10877037,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of regenerating the entire hematopoietic system. This capacity is
fully unleashed upon bone marrow transplantation, however, recent studies including ours indicate that HSCs
have a much more limited contribution to hematopoiesis during homeostasis. While stress from sources like
chemotherapies or inflammation increases the contribution from HSCs to multiple hematopoietic lineages, little
is known about how HSCs respond to stressors that cause anemia. Identifying the progenitor cell population and
signals that promote erythroid regeneration may lead to novel strategies to better harness HSCs for the treatment
of anemia and regenerative medicine overall. Using a HSC lineage tracing model, we found that hemolytic
anemia specifically enhances erythroid contribution by HSCs, indicating that HSCs respond to erythroid stress
by initiating erythropoiesis. After hemolytic anemia, HSCs expressed more erythropoiesis-related genes and
exhibited enhanced erythroid differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, HSCs had increased iron content
after hemolytic anemia and iron chelation prevented erythroid-biased differentiation. Iron is a cofactor for the
iron(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase TET2 that demethylates DNA, and erythropoiesis is associated
with DNA demethylation. We found that TET2 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in HSCs during anemia and
deletion of Tet2 suppressed the enhanced erythroid differentiation of HSCs we observed following hemolytic
anemia. We thus hypothesized that HSCs respond to anemia by increasing iron uptake, TET2 expression, and
DNA demethylation, thereby increasing the expression of erythropoiesis genes. In Aim 1, we will study the
heterogeneity of splenic HSCs during anemia and identify the erythroid-biased fraction of HSCs. In Aim 2, we
will examine the role of TET2 in promoting erythroid commitment of splenic HSC. In Aim 3, we will investigate
the mechanism by which TET2 protein is stabilized in HSCs during anemia. Completion of this study will provide
novel insights into the differences between bone marrow and splenic HSCs in responding to anemia, and the
mechanism by which iron and TET2 instructs HSCs to become committed to the erythroid lineage."
10877039,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental patterns,
increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood.
In response to RFA-AA-21-007, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium
on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for the next 5 years a
diverse community sample of male and female participants recruited in three age bands (12-14, 15-17, 18-21
years old) when most were no-to-low drinkers and tracked over the last 8 years across 5 sites (N=831; 93%
retention rate). Monitoring has involved annually acquired multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state
fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer
and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep
and physical activity tracking. This cohort sequential design uniquely positions NCANDA-A to quantify transient
or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in specific adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories
and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol's effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g., age
of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will quantify the
impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and their relations
with alcohol use patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among patterns of
alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine the extent to
which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect,
sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects of frequent binge
alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history, impact of alcohol
use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by
discovering elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."
10877040,"Unanticipated adverse drug reactions remain a major cause of post marketing withdrawals of drugs and of
restricted access to new medications. Adverse drug reactions are often caused by reactive metabolites that form
covalent adducts with proteins, but the identity and extent of protein adducts formed is often difficult to predict
and characterize. Despite decades of research, current methods are unable to produce a comprehensive and
quantitative catalog of xenobiotic protein adducts. This hinders progress in optimizing safety of novel medications
and limits our ability to define mechanisms of clinically observed adverse drug reactions. To bridge this gap, we
have developed innovative proteomic methods for discovery, characterization and quantification of protein
adducts in simple and complex biological matrices. The goal of this proposal is to establish these methods for
rapid, reliable and quantitative identification and characterization of drug-protein adducts, and uniquely
customize these methods for human adductomics research impacting drug safety assessment. We will focus on
covalent protein modifications resulting from metabolic oxidative activation of drugs. We will use a set of model
compounds that are known to cause adverse events in patients and form reactive metabolites that likely result
in protein adducts. In our aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that the modification masses and chemical
characteristics of protein adducts formed by reactive metabolites in recombinant enzyme systems predict adduct
formation in more complex systems such as liver microsomes and S9 fractions. Through this work we will
optimize our proteomics methods for complex human liver preparations from individual donors. In aim 2 we will
test the hypothesis that adduct formation varies quantitatively between individuals and due to differences in
metabolic activity and individual genotype. In this aim we will establish quantitative adductomics for individual
donors and define the basis for inter-individual variability in drug-protein adduct formation. In aim 3 we will test
the hypothesis that human hepatocytes exposed to reactive metabolites generated in situ secrete proteins that
have been adducted by the reactive intermediates. In this aim we will establish the in vitro relationship between
hepatocyte adductomic burden and secretion of adducted proteins as biomarkers. When completed, the
proposed studies will be transformative in integrating novel suite of cutting-edge tools and high-dimensional
proteomics data to characterize the deep adductomic profiles of key drugs resulting in adverse drug
reactions. The methods developed will enable the assessment and quantification of a broad range of adducts
across the human proteome. The results will generate unprecedented insight into mechanisms of enzyme
inactivation, liver adductomes formed after exposure to reactive metabolites and quantitative relationships
between adduct formation and metabolic activity in the liver. The results may ultimately lead to novel drug
discovery approaches that mitigate risk of adverse drug reactions resulting from adduct formation and to
development of targeted therapeutic interventions designed to treat adverse drug reactions."
10877041,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Using human brain connectivity to identify the causal neuroanatomical
substrate of depression symptoms
Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Identifying the brain regions causing depression
symptoms can lead to better treatment targets and therapies. Most neuroimaging studies identify brain regions
where activity correlates with depression symptoms but cannot determine whether these regions actually
cause symptoms. The goal of this project is to causally link depression symptoms to human neuroanatomy.
Lesions and brain stimulation can provide causal links to human neuroanatomy. Because symptoms can come
from regions connected to the lesion or stimulation site, we study the connectivity of these sites (not just their
location) using brain connectivity data from a large cohort of normal subjects (functional connectivity MRI,
n=1000). This allows us to map symptoms caused by lesions or stimulation to brain circuits without
connectivity data from the patients themselves. With NIMH support, we found that lesions, transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) sites, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) sites that cause a change in depression
symptoms are all connected to a common brain circuit across 14 independent datasets (Siddiqi et. al 2021
Nature Human Behaviour). Connectivity to this circuit was a better predictor of antidepressant response to
TMS or DBS than connectivity to other candidate regions (e.g., subgenual cingulate). However, this circuit
requires validation before it can be translated into a target for clinical trials. Here, we will validate our brain
circuit for depression using three independent causal sources of information: lesions (Aim 1), DBS (Aim 2), and
TMS (Aim 3). For all aims, we will use our published a priori depression circuit to predict overall depression
outcomes. We will also perform exploratory data-driven analyses to test whether different circuits are
responsible for different symptoms of depression. In Aim 1, we will prospectively test whether our depression
circuit can predict depression scores after stroke. In Aim 2, we will test whether our depression circuit can
predict change in depression score after DBS across a wide range of DBS patients with different diagnoses. In
Aim 3, we will test whether individualized connectivity to our circuit prospectively predicts change in depression
symptoms with TMS. Completion of these Aims will validate our depression circuit across different diagnoses
and across three independent causal sources of information, providing much stronger validation than could be
achieved with one modality alone. If successful, this study will facilitate future trials directly targeting our brain
circuit with therapeutic neuromodulation for depression."
10877157,"Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs offer a range of services to women living
with HIV (WLHIV) to maintain their health and minimize the risk of their HIV-exposed infants (HEI) acquiring
HIV. Despite widespread implementation of PMTCT services in sub-Saharan Africa, only two-thirds of WLHIV
are virally suppressed, and nearly 40% of HEI are lost to follow-up or die by 18 months of age. There is a
critical need to develop person-centered strategies targeting the factors preventing WLHIV and their HEI from
realizing the full benefits of PMTCT care. Mentor Mothers (MM) are peer advocates who support WLHIV and
HEI to promote improved PMTCT outcomes. While MM show promise in this regard, it is clear a “one size fits
all” approach lacks responsiveness to the fact that some WLHIV and HEI need minimal support while others
have specific needs. Research is needed to understand what strategies MM can use to address factors known
to influence PMTCT outcomes, and how best to implement these strategies with high-fidelity in real-world
settings. This proposal aims to address knowledge gaps and promote optimal PMTCT outcomes through
person-centered development of an enhanced MM strategy that focuses on both the specific problems faced
by WLHIV and HEI, as well as the real-world constraints of PMTCT programs. The central hypothesis is that
this enhanced MM strategy can be implemented with high acceptability and fidelity, resulting in improved
PMTCT outcomes. We will test this hypothesis through research targeted to the following Specific Aims. AIM 1:
Use a participatory research approach to develop an enhanced MM strategy. In Sub-Aim 1a we will perform
qualitative interviews with MM and WLHIV (both those with and without unfavorable PMTCT outcomes
[attrition, viremia, or vertical transmission]) to identify: (i) feasible enhancements to the current MM strategy, (ii)
barriers to optimizing the MM strategy, and (iii) approaches to overcoming these barriers. In Sub-Aim 1b we
will conduct participatory design workshops with key implementation stakeholders (MM, PMTCT program
leadership, and clinic staff) to develop an enhanced MM strategy with optimal potential for sustainable
implementation. AIM 2: Conduct a pilot hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness study of the enhanced MM
strategy. The enhanced MM strategy will be implemented at one clinic. We will use a mixed-methods approach
to thoroughly assess acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity to the enhanced MM strategy. A pre-post assessment
of key PMTCT outcome measures will provide preliminary effectiveness data. We expect this K23 proposal to
advance my expertise in HIV implementation science, qualitative and mixed-methods research, and person-
centered participatory design while also generating the compelling preliminary data needed to support a future
R01 application for a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial of the enhanced MM strategy. These K23
research and career development activities will culminate in my transition to independence as an R01-funded,
physician-scientist."

 The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify novel aspects of human innate lymphoid
cell (ILC) biology in airway diseases using patient-oriented research (POR) and through mentoring junior
clinical investigators. The candidate has a strong record of mentoring individuals at many levels including
clinical investigators in multiple specialties. The mentoring plan includes recruitment and training of fellow
and faculty investigators from three disciplines (allergy, otolaryngology, and pulmonary) within the UCSD
Center for Asthma and Sinus Disease center of excellence to foster the careers of junior investigators
and perform outstanding POR. There are currently large gaps in our understanding of the roles of ILCs
in human sinus disease and asthma which cause significant morbidity worldwide. ILCs are divided by
the types of cytokines they secrete and ILC2s that secrete Th2 cytokines have been shown to promote
airway inflammation in animal models. Importantly, recent work has shown that ILC2s are increased in
samples from patients with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Our group was the first to show
that ILC2s are increased in a subgroup of nasal polyps in CRS that contain eosinophils and are also
recruited to the nose after aspirin challenge in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease
(AERD). AERD patients have severe sinus disease with nasal polyps, moderate to severe asthma, and
respiratory reactions to aspirin and similar compounds. In the current proposal, we will test the hypothesis
that through the use of cutting-edge technology (single cell RNA-seq) we will be able to identify specific
subgroups or “endotypes” of patients with CRS and asthma by tissue and blood ILC subset composition.
We also posit that biologic blockade of type 2 inflammation in AERD, asthma and CRS patients will
reduce ILC2 recruitment to the airway. Critically, this award will provide protected time for POR in sinus
disease and asthma and allow for outstanding mentorship of the next generations of POR investigators."
10876970,"Project Summary
NOD1 and NOD2 are Pattern Recognition Receptors that sense fragments of bacterial peptidoglycans, and are able to detect perturbations in cellular processes such as the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and disturbance in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Under different stressful conditions, such as bacterial infections, protein misfolding and perturbations in calcium homeostasis, the ER is unable to maintain homeostasis and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Within the UPR three transmembrane receptors, IRE1α, PERK and ATF6, are activated and regulate biological processes such as inhibition of protein translation, autophagy,
and inflammation to reestablish cellular homeostasis. NOD1 and NOD2 have been implicated in ER stress- induced inflammation, by acting downstream of IRE1α in the UPR to induce inflammatory responses. This link between the UPR and NOD1/2 signaling is of particular interest in intestinal inflammation since mutations in genes associated with the UPR (XBP1) and innate immune signaling (NOD2) have been associated with intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) dysfunction in intestinal inflammatory diseases. Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) is a gram-negative bacterium that induces robust inflammation, partially dependent on NOD1/2 activation, of the intestinal epithelium resulting in gastroenteritis. As a survival mechanism, S. Tm has adapted to these
inflammatory conditions in the intestinal tract by utilizing products of inflammation as a nutrient source to outcompete the resident microbiota. Considering the importance of ER stress in intestinal inflammation and the fact that S. Tm is a major cause of gastroenteritis, it is surprising that ER stress in the context of Salmonella infections is significantly underexplored. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether S. Tm can exploit ER stress-induced inflammation resulting in luminal expansion. Our objectives are to investigate the link between ER stress and inflammation in the S. Tm-induced colitis model. Our central hypothesis is that activation of the ER stress response in the gastrointestinal tract contributes significantly to S. Tm-induced inflammation, luminal expansion and pathology. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims. 1) Determine the contribution of calcium flux and UPR activation to NOD1/2 signaling. In in vitro experiments we will determine which branches of the UPR, in conjunction with dysregulation of calcium signaling, contributes to NOD1/2 activation. 2) Determine the role of CHOP in the S. Tm-induced colitis model. Using Chop-/- mice and conditional mutant mice we will investigate the role of CHOP in S. Tm-induced inflammation and outgrowth. 3) Determine the role of NOD1/2 and IRE1α in response to S. Tm. We will investigate the role of IRE1α in Nod1/2-/- mice in the S. Tm-induced colitis model. Characterizing the mechanisms downstream of the UPR that orchestrate ER
stress-induced responses is necessary to safely modulate this process for the development of future therapeutics and will significantly increase our understanding in Salmonella pathogenesis."

The T cell receptor (TCR) endows mammals with the capacity to detect cellular perturbations in a host
resulting from myriad infectious pathogens, physical damage (thermal, irradiation, etc.) or pre-malignant or
malignant cellular transformations while averting strong self-reactivities that could induce autoimmunity. The
recent discoveries uncovering the mechanoreceptor properties of the TCR and its developmental precursor,
the preTCR, have far-reaching implications in T cell biology. The overall goal of this Program Project is to
understand the molecular underpinnings of TCR function through a convergence of single molecule, structural
and biological investigations. First, Core B will support each project by providing protein production at scales
appropriate for single molecule, single cell, NMR, or X-ray crystallography. The range of proteins to be
produced in wild-type, conjugated, or mutated forms include: TCRαβ, TCRβ, preTCR (pTα/β), MHCI (full length
and truncated), and MHCI-like T22, CD1c and CD1d. Core B operates synergistically, where the experimental
(Project 1-3) and computational teams (Core C) will cooperate with the protein production team to guide
mutant design, construct selection and subsequent production. Our teams have already laid the foundation for
successful demonstration of this workflow. Second, Core B will serve as a central repository for DNA
sequences and constructs to assist in transfer of knowledge between projects. We have designed a vector
suite facilitating the transfer of each clonotypic TCR sequence as well as sequences of MHC between each
technique encompassed in the Program Project. Third, Core B will work closely with Project 3 to incorporate
specific labeling technologies into both prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein production processes. By combining
these critical functions, Core B will be a central hub contributing to the entire program."
10877943,"Project Summary: Core C – Molecular Dynamics (MD) Core
 This P01 project explores several novel concepts and hypotheses regarding the role of mechanical force for
the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire selection, antigen recognition, and signal generation. Core C carries out
computer simulations that are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms at the atomistic level. Supported by our
preliminary experimental and computational data, the key scientiﬁc premise of Core C is that pre-TCR (pT - )
and TCR function not as static structures, but by undergoing dynamic conformational motion. In particular, we
have found that load can control the relative motion between different domains of TCR, which in turn affect the
geometry of the antigenic peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding interface. The novel
mechanism will be further tested and reﬁned through collaboration with experimental projects. Our analyses
include: exhaustive monitoring of intra- and inter-molecular contact dynamics, conformational entropy calcu-
lation, and identifying mechanically responsive domain motion. To test whether the proposed load-response
mechanism is speciﬁc for TCR , we will carry out comparative studies of TCR that is functionally different
from TCR and is less responsive to load. Using the computational approaches developed for TCR , we will
investigate the effect of load on pT - . Preliminary simulation using our newly discovered x-ray structure rep-
resenting a preTCR-MHC complex indicates that the binding interface between a peptide-free MHC and TCR
is highly dynamic and mobile. We posit that a bound antigenic peptide and load will stabilize the interface into a
conﬁguration amenable to the repertoire selection at the pT - stage. Simulations in Core C will be developed
through strong feedback loops established with individual projects, utilizing data from optical tweezers (Project 1
and 2), transcriptome (Project 1 for TCR and Project 2 for pT - ), and NMR (Project 3). Furthermore, in col-
laboration with Core B (Protein Design), Core C will provide simulation-based design of mutants and chimeras
that will be experimentally tested. Simulations will be performed on structures available in Protein Data Bank
as well as new structures of TCR and pT - , individually or complexed with pMHC, that will be solved in
this P01 project. We have access to several supercomputers that are sufﬁcient for performing simulations as
needed."

Project 1 investigates αβTCR function spanning in vitro single molecule and single cell assays that interrogate
force-dependent mechanosensor activation by peptide/MHC (pMHC) ligands with optical tweezers to in vivo
assays with corresponding retrogenic αβ T cells addressing biological consequences such as naïve T cell
expansion and memory T cell formation and maintenance. Thus, Project 1 couples αβTCR molecular
mechanism with functional biology. From a systems perspective, Project 1 links with Project 2 of the preTCR
(pTαβ) by executing parallel tests on the mature αβTCR. Parameters will also be measured for single cell
activation including the activation threshold, force range for activation and intracellular calcium profile. Project 1
is tightly integrated with NMR and Project 3, where structural and conformational changes as a consequence
of mutations (strengthening, weakening, substitutions) will be defined and mapped onto changes in measured
parameters. At the single molecule level, conformational change(s), force bond lifetime, extension magnitude,
critical force and transition energy landscape will be measured. At the single cell level, the physical and
chemical requirements to trigger (critical force window and pMHC density) will be characterized. TCRs will also
be evaluated in vivo (naïve mouse) for their ability to induce T cell proliferation upon exposure to infectious
pathogens such as influenza A and their ability to form central or tissue resident memory T cells. Single cells
will be triggered at critical force thresholds and then recovered through micropipette aspiration for
transcriptome analysis. The overarching goal is to pair single molecule and single cell measurements of Aim 1
with functional biological impact of Aim 2. Strategically, the project will execute a cycle of measurements
involving single molecule single cell, functional biology, structure biology utilizing NMR and molecular
dynamics to permit refinement of our models and confirmation or rejection of our atomistic hypotheses to
explain αβTCR mechanobiology."

  T cells mediate adaptive immune recognition essential for self vs. non-self discrimination via clonally
distributed T cell receptors (TCRs) generated in the thymus through  and  gene rearrangements. Sculpting of
the T cell repertoire through both positive and negative selection occurs at the CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP)
stage of thymic development where  TCRs first appear. Prior to the DP stage, individual  chains associate
with the invariant pre-T (pT), forming preTCRs on the surface of early thymocytes. pT consists of a C-like
Ig domain lacking a V domain. Signaling through preTCR was considered a ligand-independent, autonomous
process. Our recent data show otherwise. Using NMR spectroscopy, interactions between two distinct preTCR
 chains and peptide/MHC (pMHC) ligands are observed involving canonical V CDR loops and a hydrophobic
patch accessible on the molecular surface of the unpaired preTCR V domain. These observations have been
recapitulated and extended using biomembrane force probe (BFP) and optical tweezers (OT) analyses of
preTCRs on intact early thymocytes. Mutation of preTCR V CDR and patch residues impacts early thymocyte
proliferation and developmental progression to the DP stage in both fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) and OP9-
DL4 stromal cell-dependent differentiation systems. PreTCR-pMHC interaction triggers thymocyte calcium flux,
revealing ligand-dependent signaling. Here we pursue three aims to define preTCR mechanobiology. In Aim 1,
we will use high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) of thymocyte subpopulations to determine 
repertoire changes as a consequence of preTCR-ligand interaction in vitro using single chain pMHC expressing
stroma and thymocyte progenitors as well as by performing in vivo analysis in B6 MHC sufficient and deficient
mice. We shall identify  chains selected for loss or survival during thymic development and perform RNAseq
on B6 Rag2-/- thymocytes transduced with each type, determining the relationship of preTCR ligation,
biomechanics and transcriptome at population and single cell level. In Aim 2, structural features and
mechanobiology of the preTCRs will be interrogated with single molecule (SM) OT experiments to assess the
impact of diverse preTCRs on structural transitions, bond lifetimes, hopping between compact and extended
states and their relationship to thymic development. In addition, structural studies by NMR in collaboration with
Project 3, Core B, Core C and X-ray crystallography shall define individual molecular population states of ligated
and unligated preTCR conformers. In Aim 3, we will determine if TCRs, distinct from TCRs and preTCRs in
lacking the elongated C chain FG loop element, manifest bond prolongation under force. Both human and
mouse TCRs with defined CD1c or CD1d ligand specificities as well as G8  that interacts with T22 will be
compared using SM, single molecule single cell (SMSC) and single cell (SC) OT analyses with chimeric versions
in which VV module is intact but CC replaces the CC constant module. B6 Rag2-/- thymocyte transduced
wild type  versus chimeric TCRs will be assessed for progression in the presence or absence of ligands."

 To protect us from myriad diseases, adaptive immunity requires T cell recognition of protein-derived peptides
of foreign, mutant, or otherwise anomalous origin expressed on the surface of aberrant cells. Central to T cell
function is the cell surface  T cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes these various peptides bound to major
histocompatibility molecules (pMHC). While a great deal is known about the static conformations of TCR
molecules and their pMHC ligands as well as the resultant ligation complexes, it is still unknown precisely what
happens within the TCR-pMHC complex to generate the diverse signaling outcomes which drive T cell
responses. Recent experiments have highlighted the dynamic nature of TCR-pMHC ligation and signaling, with
a critical input of force necessary to generate T cell responses. This implies a dynamic system, poised to signal
with the input of piconewton (pN) amounts of force to generate signaling-ready TCR proteins. We propose to
develop NMR methods for studies of large extracellular domains involved in TCR mechanobiology, including the
TCR and its developmental precursor, the preTCR, as well as the pMHC ligands that are at the limit of NMR
observation. This includes protein domains that cannot be expressed in bacterial systems and thus cannot
readily be perdeuterated, a current standard labeling strategy for addressing high molecular weight protein
systems. Thus, in Aim 1 we employ direct 15N-detection methods, which do not require protein perdeuteration
for backbone resonance assignment. Further, we will develop new 13C-detected experiments with TROSY
enhancement that yield highly resolved spectra of aromatic side chains. To augment the state of the art NMR
technology above, in Aim 2 we will establish new labeling schemes to aid in deciphering the structure and
dynamics of preTCR, TCR and pMHC. To tackle the resonance assignment of these large proteins we will pursue
the use of “mixed pyruvate” as a carbon source to label proteins to obtain residue specific patterns. In tandem
with Aim 1 we will produce isolated 13C and 13C-19F labeled aromatic amino acids through chemoenzymatic
synthesis. Since some protein components of the TCR systems we intend to study cannot be recombinantly
expressed in E.Coli, we will pursue expression in eukaryotic systems, where complete deuteration is a challenge.
The labeling technology developed here will be transferred to Core B. In Aim 3, we will use the NMR technologies
and labeling methods, described above, to obtain information about structure and dynamics of TCR-pMHC
complexes. In particular relaxation dispersion and CEST, we will leverage 19F nuclei as probe to access dynamics
in the low microsecond time scale. The extracted dynamics information will be utilized with the MD Core C to
observe dynamics in silico and link the dynamics and conformational states measured in NMR to those that are
observed under force. Functional impact of the atomistic findings will be assessed in Projects 1 and 2 through
mutational iterations. The NMR methods forged here will illuminate the proverbial blind spot in mechanistic
understanding of TCR activation, already previewed via exciting preliminary hidden state data in Aim 3."
10877950,"PROJECT 1: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Project 1 of the UC Berkeley Superfund Research Center will conduct discovery- and community-driven
research in some of California’s (CA) most vulnerable communities to elucidate the perinatal health effects
associated with exposures to drinking water contaminant mixtures (Aim 1), characterize the presence of
chemical contaminants in drinking water of current and emerging health concern (Aim 2), and report back
results to participants, communities and agency decision-makers to inform public health actions (Aim 3). Over
three quarters of the public water systems that are out of compliance are in just 7 of CA’s 58 counties in the
southern San Joaquin (Tulare Lake Basin), and Salinas Valleys, where industrial and agricultural activities
have resulted in elevated levels of hazardous chemicals in drinking water. These contaminants include arsenic,
nitrate, pesticides, hexavalent chromium, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which each have
documented health effects such as carcinogenicity, developmental effects, and endocrine disruption. That
these exposures occur in disadvantaged communities that are disproportionately Latinx raises environmental
justice concerns and underscores the need for community-engaged research. Project 1 proposes research
through the auspices of the Water Equity Science Shop (WESS), a multidisciplinary collaboration that includes
the Community Water Center, the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles, Silent Spring Institute,
and the CA Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Together WESS members will collaborate
with US EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure and BC Labs to carry out the project aims.
We will assess the perinatal health effects of multiple drinking water contaminants found in community water
systems and domestic well areas in the Salinas Valley and Tulare Lake Basin using mixtures methods and
machine learning to characterize heterogeneous effects of contaminants on fetal growth outcomes in a
demographically diverse study population (Aim 1: N=~740,000 births). We will recruit and sample tap water
from 100 households in the same regions to characterize drinking water threats from regulated and novel
unregulated compounds using data-driven methods, including dasymetric mapping techniques, to identify and
prioritize disadvantaged communities for study testing. We will then apply targeted and non-targeted analyses
of tap water samples to characterize the presence of multiple regulated and unregulated novel compounds of
current and emerging concern for cancer, developmental toxicity, and endocrine disruption (Aim 2). Finally, we
develop and deploy novel digital tools for report back of individual and aggregate contaminant measurements
to households and stakeholders to elucidate solutions to prevent and reduce exposures (Aim 3). The
combination of prior successful partnership, scientific expertise, and deep community knowledge makes the
WESS well-suited to conduct the collaborative science needed to effectively address drinking water threats
and associated health risks in CA’s most vulnerable communities."

There are no effective non-invasive diagnostic imaging approaches to accurately stratify and monitor
immunotherapy in adults and children with glioma. PET imaging, utilizing radiolabeled antibody fragments,
minibodies (Mb), or diabodies (Db), stably chelated to radiometals, is a promising option for the safe and effective
direct quantification of cell surface markers in glioma patients that reflect dynamic immunological processes that
bear directly on immunotherapeutic effectiveness. However, development of PET for molecular imaging of
markers to guide immunotherapy is in its nascent stage. The long-term goal of this application is to translate
effective antibody fragment-based radiotracers for non-invasive diagnostic imaging before and during
immunotherapy to meaningfully impact clinical decision making for patients on immunotherapies. The overall
objective of this application is to validate radiotracer compositions for unique situations in monitoring
immunotherapies in patient-relevant murine glioma models. The rationale for the proposed research is that non-
invasive diagnostic imaging with radiotracers quantifying an important immune target, activated T-cells, and
immunosuppressive cells to prevent and shorten the duration of ineffective therapies. The central hypothesis is
that radiolabeled CD11b, EphA2, and CD69, antibody-based PET tracers can effectively guide immunotherapies
for malignant gliomas. In Aim 1, CD11b will be quantified in glioma models by PET with Cu-64-labeled anti-
CD11b Mb/Db to quantify immunosuppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMC) before and during TAMC-
targeted immunotherapies. In Aim 2 preclinical PET will be employed to quantify EphA2 expression levels in
gliomas. EphA2, a highly relevant clinical immunotherapy target, will serve as a “proof of principle” antigen, and
provide a base to develop comprehensive antigen-PET strategies. Standard uptake values (SUV) of Cu-64-
labeled anti-EphA2 Mb/Db will be used to quantify EphA2 levels on glioma cells in syngeneic orthotopic models
with a range of EphA2 levels and identify glioma-bearing mice that will respond to immunotherapies. In Aim 3,
responses to glioma immunotherapy will be assessed by CD69 PET with Cu-64-labeled anti-CD69 Mb/Db to
quantify T-cell activation and predict survival rates of glioma-bearing mice following T-cell-mediated
immunotherapies. The use of robust imaging probe chemistry, adult and pediatric murine glioma models, and
immunotherapy approaches, will validate novel human/mouse cross-reactive Mb/Db for their translational
capacity. If successful, this proposal will radically change the way gliomas are stratified and monitored on
immunotherapy trials, using real-time molecular PET imaging to determine which subjects to enroll and when to
stop or continue therapy. Outcomes from this research will greatly improve response rates to immunotherapy
while reducing unnecessary treatment-related side effects, ineffective and costly treatments, in an era of
precision medicine with increased treatment options."
10884224,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding how the coordination of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) influences biological processes, such as
transcription and alternative splicing, is a major goal in computational genomics. This remains a challenge
because CRE activity at any given locus may depend on a host of other factors, including sequence context
and/or the presence of other CREs nearby. Recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have revolutionized our ability to predict regulatory functions from DNA sequence. Unlike previous computational
methods based on position-weight matrices, which capture an additive model of CREs, CNNs can, in principle,
also learn higher-order dependencies within the CRE, with other CREs, and with the broader sequence context.
However, CNNs are essentially black box models, with parameters that don’t have clear biological meaning.
Hence it remains a challenge to translate the improved predictions of a CNN to new biological insights. Here we
propose to develop three different computational methods that can comprehensively characterize higher-order
interactions within CREs and across different CREs from functional genomics data, specifically ChIP-seq and
CLIP-seq data publicly available through ENCODE. Each method serves as its own separate Aim and will be
developed in parallel. In Aim 1, we will develop a new post hoc model interpretability method based on employing
interpretable quantitative models originally developed to understand complex genetic interactions in laboratory-
based comprehensive mutagenesis (e.g. multiplex assays of variant effects) to characterize CRE dependencies
learned by a CNN, using synthetic sequences to target specific biological hypotheses. In Aim 2, we will develop
new CNN architectures where the learned parameters will express higher-order interactions that have direct
biological interpretations. In Aim 3, we will combine a Bayesian nonparametric framework for modeling CREs
with CNN-based CRE annotations and GPU acceleration to develop new methods for understanding how CREs
are specified in the genome. Successful completion of these Aims will provide a leap forward in our
understanding of higher-order CRE dependencies that are exploited but have not yet been fully revealed by
CNNs. This work will provide the community with: (1) a new suite of open-source computational tools that
address the problem of modeling CREs and their dependencies in functional genomics data; and (2) a
comprehensive genome-wide catalogue of CRE syntax for transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins that
will be hosted on a user-friendly webserver."
10881197,"Clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa) initiates the activation of the coagulation cascade by binding to the procoagulant
cofactor tissue factor. Recombinant FVIIa is a clinically approved drug for treating bleeding in hemophilia patients
with inhibitors and other bleeding disorders. It is also used off-label to treat severe bleeding associated with
surgery, liver disease, and intracerebral hemorrhage. We have discovered that FVIIa also binds to the
anticoagulant cofactor, endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR). FVIIa binding to EPCR modulates protein
C/activated protein C-mediated anticoagulant pathway. Our studies also established that FVIIa-EPCR activates
protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-induced biased cell signaling, resulting in anti-inflammatory and vascular
barrier protective effects. Interestingly, our recent studies revealed that FVIIa-EPCR-PAR1-mediated biased
signaling induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from endothelial cells (EEVs). These vesicles are
found to exhibit hemostatic and anti-inflammatory properties. EVs are increasingly recognized as important
mediators of intercellular communication, play an important role in various pathophysiological processes, and
likely have immense therapeutic potential. Understanding the biogenesis and release of FVIIa-generated EVs,
characterizing their cargo, interactions with recipient cells, and their behavior in vivo is crucial for assessing their
role in pathophysiology and fully capitalizing on their therapeutic and drug delivery potential. The proposed aims
are designed to address these important knowledge gaps. Our overall hypothesis is that FVIIa-released EVs
contribute to hemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and vascular barrier protective effects by communicating with other
cell types by transferring their unique cargo. These EVs hold therapeutic potential in treating bleeding disorders,
inflammation, and hemophilic arthropathy. The specific aims are, Aim 1: Investigate the hypothesis that FVIIa-
released EEVs are unique and distinct from EEVs released by other coagulation proteases. Aim 2: Elucidate the
mechanism of FVIIa-released EV biogenesis, phosphatidylserine (PS) enrichment of FVIIa-released EEVs, and
their distribution and fate in vivo. Aim 3: Determine the role of FVIIa-released EEVs in hemostasis and
inflammation and elucidate potential mechanisms. Aim 4: Determine the effect of FVIIa-released EEVs in the
treatment of hemophilic arthropathy (HA) and explore the potential contribution of miR10a, found in the cargo of
FVIIa-released EEVs, to this process. In these proposed studies, we will employ an unbiased omics approach
to characterize FVIIa-released EEVs. We will also use loss- and gain-of-functional studies, unique transgenic
mice, and murine model systems of bleeding, hemophilic arthropathy, and inflammation. The knowledge gained
from our studies will not only lead to more efficient and cost-effective clinical treatments for hemophilia patients
but also lead to novel therapeutic strategies for bleeding and inflammatory disorders. Our studies will contribute
to a paradigm shift in our current understanding of proteases-induced cell signaling and their potential to affect
cellular processes in distant cells through communication via EVs."

The long-term goals of this project are to develop a high-resolution understanding of ion channel function,
assembly, and regulation. Our studies focus on uncovering the architectural foundations that underlie the
modulation and assembly of channels from the voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily and seek to
address the fundamental question of how these multi-subunit protein complexes are assembled into properly
functioning forms. There are exemplar structures of representatives of most major VGIC classes that reveal a
shared, intricately assembled, multi-domain architecture. Although it has been appreciated for decades that
assembly of such proteins is critical for their proper function, there has been no direct structural information to inform
how such complicated multi-unit assembles are put together or whether they interact with chaperone proteins that aid in
their assembly. Among VGICs, the high-voltage activated class of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV1s and
CaV2s) represent a paradigmatic case whose function and trafficking is powerfully shaped by interactions
between pore-forming CaV1 or CaV2 CaVa1 and auxiliary CaVb and CaVa2d subunits. Our studies focus on the
first known structure of an ion channel:chaperone complex, recently determined by our lab, comprising the brain
and heart CaV1.2 channel, CaVb3, and a nine subunit membrane protein chaperone assembly known as the
Endoplasmic reticulum Membrane protein Complex (EMC). Binding to the EMC chaperone appears to prepare
the CaVa1/CaVb pair for handoff to the CaVa2d to complete channel assembly. We aim to understand which
EMC:channel interactions are important for channel biogenesis, how disease mutations affect EMC:CaV interactions, and
the factors that drive the channel assembly handoff mechanism. The EMC interaction sites are conserved throughout
the CaV1 and CaV2 families and may be shared by other VGIC superfamily members. A second effort is directed at
defining other VGIC EMC clients and determining if they use common elements to interact with the EMC. Elaboration
of the underlying structural framework of VGIC biogenesis is essential for understanding how VGICs are made
and integrated into intracellular signaling pathways and for developing new ways to control channel function.
Our efforts encompass a multidisciplinary approach that includes biochemical, biophysical, mass spectrometry,
and cryo-electronmicroscopy studies to probe structure and cell biological and electrophysiological
measurements to dissect function. Because of their important roles in human physiology, VGICs are targets for
drugs with great utility for treating cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, congestive heart failure, epilepsy, and
chronic pain. Thus, understanding their structures mechanisms of assembly at atomic level detail should greatly
assist development of valuable therapeutic agents for a wide range of human ailments."
10882848,"Combustion-emitted particulate matter (CE-PM) is emitted through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and
biomass and is a critical public health and climate change issue in the United States (US) and worldwide. A key
feature of CE-PM is the presence of black carbon (BC) cores as universal carriers of a wide variety of
combustion-derived chemical constituents. Due to different temporality and spatiality for major CE-PM emissions
and a large intra- and inter-individual variation in respiratory physiology, significant knowledge gaps remain
regarding the dose of BC particles in human lungs as well as the dose-response relationship of lung deposition
dose with lung aging and mortality. Accelerated lung aging is a risk factor for the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, two leading causes of disability and death in the US
and globally. Epigenetic alteration is a hallmark of lung aging and implicates key biological pathways underlying
COPD development. Our overarching goals are 1) to evaluate the impact of lung deposition dose of BC and
sputum methylation change on lung function decline (LFD) and mortality, and 2) to explore the lung dose of BC
– epigenetics interactions. This project will be conducted in 1071 members from the Lovelace Smokers Cohort
and 500 members from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study who have ≥4 spirometry and longitudinal sputum
collections. Macrophage carbon load assay is a novel sputum cytology-based method that quantifies BC particles
in macrophages and reflects lung dose of total CE-PM exposure at an individual level over the past several
months. An innovative machine-learning algorithm for engulfed carbon particles has been developed that
automates the scoring process with high accuracy. Aim 1 will evaluate the dose-response relationships between
lung dose of BC, LFD, and mortality. Our recent studies showed that promoter methylation of a 12-gene panel
measured in baseline sputum is capable of quantifying the extent of airway remodeling and predicts LFD and
mortality. Aim 2 will characterize the sputum methylation index (MI) trajectory in longitudinal samples in a subset
(n=200) and then quantify the change of sputum MI between baseline and 5-year follow-up in all study subjects
(n=1571). The endotype (sputum methylation) – phenotype (LFD) correlation will be assessed. Identifying
determinants of sputum MI change is a key component for characterizing its full validity as a lung aging
biomarker. Aim 3 will assess whether total CE-PM exposure, baseline MI, and established risk factors affecting
baseline MI are associated with sputum MI change. Aim 4 will explore the moderation effect of epigenetic lung
aging on the associations between total CE-PM exposure, LFD, and mortality. This study represents a novel and
significant advance for air pollution epidemiology through characterizing the dose of BC in human lungs as well
as its dose-response relationships with lung aging and mortality. Findings from this study will inform future
research, facilitating the development of novel air quality metrics based on BC to mitigate health risks and
address climate change."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease with elevated prevalence in women
and individuals of Asian, African, and Hispanic ancestries. SLE patients present a broad range of symptoms
across multiple organ systems and differentially respond to treatments. Our central hypothesis is twofold: 1)
genetic drivers of SLE affect gene regulatory mechanisms in specific cell types and activation states, and 2)
cellular drivers responsible for disease initiation and exacerbation may exhibit transcriptional regulatory states
(e.g., epigenomic states) poised to respond to environmental disease triggers. To test this hypothesis, we will
use highly innovative multiplexed multimodal single-cell sequencing to map cell-type-specific epigenomic,
transcriptomic, and surface protein features that stratify patients. When integrated with SLE GWAS data, we will
further fine-map SLE-associated variants and annotate the cellular contexts by which associated variants act
through. Finally, utilizing a novel strategy to sequence capillary blood, we will characterize circulating immune
cells in SLE patients during flare, resolution, and response to discrete treatments.

10882904,"ABSTRACT
The cardinal aberrant hallmarks of melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, are driven by recurrent
alterations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes, of which mutational activation of BRAF or NRAS is
particularly common. Moreover, although therapeutic options for melanoma patients have been
transformed by the advent of both immune-oncology (I/O) and pathway-targeted therapies, significant
challenges remain in the treatment of this disease. For BRAF-driven melanoma patients who fail I/O
therapy, their disease is often sensitive to FDA-approved pathway-targeted drugs that inhibit BRAFV600E
signaling. By contrast, for patients with NRAS-driven melanoma, who are either ineligible for, or refractory
to I/O therapy, their second-line options are limited and of limited therapeutic efficacy. Indeed, despite
our detailed knowledge of key signaling pathways downstream of NRAS oncoproteins, there are no FDA-
approved pathway-targeted therapies for the second-line treatment of NRAS-driven melanoma patients.
Against this background, and to tackle these challenges, the long-term, overarching goal of our research
is to design new combinations of pathway-targeted therapy for NRAS-driven melanoma that: 1. Increase
the overall response rate and depth of each patient's primary anti-tumor response; 2. Maximize safety
and tolerability, while minimizing toxicity and; 3. Enhance durability of response by forestalling the onset
of lethal drug resistance. To that end, based on compelling preliminary data, the short-term aims of this
R01 are: 1. Test the anti-melanoma activity of a novel, first-in-class direct pharmacological inhibitor of
NRAS oncoprotein signaling; 2. Define mechanism(s) of resistance to such novel agents and; 3.
Determine the role of autophagy as an adaptive mechanism of resistance to inhibition of NRAS
oncoprotein signaling. To prosecute these aims we will leverage state-of-the-art resources including: 1.
Innovative genetically engineered and melanoma patient-derived xenograft mouse models; 2.
Companion NRAS- or BRAF-driven melanoma cell lines reflecting the full complexity of the disease; 3.
An array of potent, specific and selective inhibitors of key melanoma signaling pathways with an emphasis
on NRAS, RAF or PI3’-kinase signaling. In addition, an outstanding group of collaborators will provide
support to critically evaluate the design, execution and results of the proposed research with a view to
translating this research into investigator-initiated clinical trials to substantially improve the prognosis for
patients with NRAS-driven melanoma. The overall and long-term impact of this research will lie in
providing the mechanistic groundwork and scientific rationale for direct pharmacological targeting of
NRAS oncoproteins, either as single agents or in therapeutic combinations, leading to new regimens of
therapy thereby ultimately transforming NRAS-driven melanoma into a chronic or a curable disease."
10882905,"Neural stem cell (NSC) homeostasis represents a state of delicate equilibrium between self-renewal, differentiation,
and survival. It is fundamental to the development, growth, and regeneration of the nervous system. Defects in NSC
homeostasis underlie broad neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms
underlying the control of NSC homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Drosophila has been instrumental in
discovering signaling molecules such as Notch and Numb and cellular mechanisms such as asymmetric cell division
that are centrally involved in NSC homeostasis. The Drosophila larval brain type II neuroblasts (NBs) have served as
an excellent model for studying NSC homeostasis. Similar to mammalian NSCs in lineage hierarchy, the type II NB
lineages in the Drosophila larval brain contain transit-amplifying intermediate progenitors (IPs), which can generate a
vast number of differentiated progenies. Notch signaling is critical for maintaining the homeostasis of type II NB
lineages. Inhibition of Notch signaling results in NB not being properly maintained, whereas Notch hyperactivation
causes ectopic NB formation and brain tumorigenesis. Notch signaling also regulates the homeostasis of mammalian
NSCs, with deregulated Notch signaling having been linked to brain cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which
Notch signaling regulates NSC homeostasis, however, are not well delineated. Previous studies have focused heavily
on canonical Notch signaling mediated by transcription factors acting in the nucleus. We have found that a non-
canonical Notch signaling (NNS) pathway operating in the cytosol and involving mitochondria critically mediates Notch
function in NSC homeostasis. The clinical significance of this NNS pathway is underscored by our observation that
tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) are particularly sensitive to perturbation of this pathway. Moreover, we found
that this NNS pathway exerts co-translational quality control over a master regulator of cell growth. The goal of this
proposal is to move away from the status quo of transcriptional control of NSC behavior by Notch and focus on the
newly discovered co-translational quality control mechanism by NNS signaling. Our central hypothesis is that non-
canonical N signaling regulates NSC homeostasis through a signaling cascade emanating from mitochondria and
impinging on the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) of a master regulator of cell growth. To test this
hypothesis, we propose three integrated Specific Aims. Aim 1 will characterize features of the translation of the growth
regulator that necessitates RQC. Aim 2 will examine the functional relationship between a key RQC factor and this
growth regulator in NSCs and CSCs. Aim 3 will dissect the molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial activity
signals to the RQC machinery to regulate the translation of the growth regulator. Upon successful completion of these
Aims, we will have generated new mechanistic insights into the control of NSC homeostasis by Notch. We anticipate
that this will open entirely new directions for studying the fundamental roles of Notch in NSC and cancer biology."

Adolescence is a dynamic developmental stage in which health trajectories can pivot, in both negative and
positive directions. A comprehensive understanding of normative adolescent development provides an essential
template for detecting early deviations from maturational trajectories, along with actionable windows in which
intervention can maximally impact health trajectories. In pediatric medicine, height and weight growth charts are
used as a reference to detect abnormal development and alert physicians to intervene. While highly scalable,
height/weight charts do not capture the important neurodevelopmental changes occurring over adolescence. To
be most informative for adolescent risk detection and intervention, we need to map development in modifiable
brain-based metrics that change over adolescence. These measures must be assessable at-scale and predict
health outcomes. We propose that reference models of sleep physiology over adolescence carry high potential
value for early detection of brain-based health risk and subsequent effective intervention. Sleep macro- and
micro-architecture undergoes dramatic change over adolescence; plays an active role in sculpting the structural
and functional maturation of the brain; is associated with myriad sociocultural, environmental, and sex/pubertal
factors; predicts long-term brain, behavior, and health trajectories; and is modifiable with non-invasive
biobehavioral intervention. However, a barrier to wide use of sleep physiology for risk assessment is that
polysomnography, the gold standard measure, is a costly method with limited scalability. Thus, we must validate
accessible methods that measure sleep at home; in doing so, we will reduce barriers to quality health care,
particularly for underserved groups. To improve sleep-based risk assessment in adolescents, our goal is to
create normative growth charts for sleep physiological features in typically developing young people using two
complementary sleep measurement methods: gold-standard polysomnography and a wearable sleep recording
device. First, we will examine age trends in sleep physiology in typically developing young people (N~1300, 9-
26yr) with polysomnography data harmonized across multiple existing cohorts (Aim 1). In tandem, we will use
the wearable device to collect home sleep recordings in typically developing young people (N=500, 9-26yr). A
subset of this sample (N=250 participants) will also complete polysomnography. We will use measurement-in-
error modeling to establish a functional relationship between sleep outcomes derived from polysomnography
and the wearable device (Aim 2). Then, we will recapitulate normative age trends in sleep physiology with the
data obtained from the wearable device and evaluate potential sociocultural, environmental, and sex/pubertal
modifiers of sleep physiology age trends (Aim 3). Completion of our aims will provide an essential normative
template for the study of adolescent sleep physiology, tools to improve detection of suboptimal sleep in the real-
word, and a comprehensive understanding of how multiple mechanisms influence age-associated sleep patterns."
10884934,"PROJECT SUMMARY
From May 2020 to April 2021, more than 100,000 individuals died of a drug overdose, making it the leading
cause of injury death in the United States.[1] The increase in the overdose death rate has primarily been borne
by American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Black people, with the overdose rate of AI/ANs (29.8/100,000)
and Blacks (27.3/100,000) now exceeding that of non-Hispanic Whites (23.6/100,000).[4] In North Carolina
(NC) from 2019 to 2020, the overdose death rate increased by more than 75% for AI/ANs and 52% for Blacks,
compared to a 19% increase for non-Hispanic Whites.[25]
Distributing naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal agent, is an effective method for reducing opioid overdose
deaths.[5, 6] The majority of overdose deaths involve opioids, including the synthetic opioid, fentanyl,[26] which
has prompted large-scale national efforts to increase naloxone availability.[5] Naloxone can be purchased at
community pharmacies and is also distributed for free by community-based entities, such as syringe service
programs (SSPs). Unfortunately, recent studies have documented racial and geographic disparities in access
to naloxone, which may contribute to growing disparities in opioid overdose deaths.[7-10, 14, 31]
To our knowledge, no comprehensive measure of naloxone availability has been reported in the literature.
Most studies of naloxone availability assess single sources, such as pharmacies[11-16] or community-based
programs,[17, 18] leaving an incomplete picture of total community-level access. Our objective is to develop a
novel, comprehensive place-based measure of naloxone availability in order to document disparities in
naloxone access. For Aim 1, we will work with an Advisory Board to create a novel, comprehensive place-
based measure of naloxone availability. We will combine primary data collected from a secret shopper study of
community pharmacies and surveys of NC’s naloxone distribution entities with secondary insurance claims
data to comprehensively document sources of naloxone by ZIP code. For Aim 2, we will estimate disparities in
naloxone availability for: (1) AI/AN and Black communities; (2) rural populations; and (3) populations at high-
risk of an opioid overdose.[20, 21] For Aim 3, we will identify how social and community factors, such as
community-level social segregation and drug-related arrests, mediate the relationship between geographic
location and racial disparities in naloxone availability. This study will result in the development of visual tools
and maps that display racial and geographic disparities in availability so that naloxone-distributing entities can
coordinate efforts to ensure equity in naloxone distribution to prevent opioid overdose deaths. We will also
disseminate our measurement development framework so it can be readily replicated in other states."
10884936,"The 2021-2025 HIV National Strategic Plan (HIV Plan) recognizes stigma as a barrier to the success of the
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative given consistent data highlighting the relationship between stigma
and suboptimal HIV testing, prevention, and treatment outcomes. The prioritization of stigma by government
agencies has yet to translate to scaled stigma mitigation strategies as a means of improving mental health,
quality of life, and optimizing the HIV response. In response, our goal is to address the disconnect between
practice and priorities in HIV epidemic control by systematically collecting stigma data in partnership with
seven health departments and community partners in priority EHE areas, systematically visualizing key stigma
indicators and the potential impact of stigma mitigation on EHE pillars and local HIV incidence, and using
implementation research to optimize the usability of these tools and inform stigma mitigation interventions.
These goals will be achieved via the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1 – Use historical and future iterations of data from AMIS, TWIST, PLHIV Stigma Index 2.0,
NHBS, combined with systematic reviews to create stigma dashboards integrated into AIDSVu.
Specific Aim 2 Using stigma data to model and visualize the effects of stigma and stigma mitigation
interventions on proximal EHE indicators including incidence, knowledge of status, diagnoses, linkage to HIV
care, viral suppression, and PrEP coverage.
Specific Aim 3 – Use qualitative methods with health departments and CBO partners to inform the
optimization of the Stigma Dashboard including usability, presentation, and information included to inform
stigma-related policies and the development of local stigma mitigation strategies.
These aims are highly responsive to “Respond: Epidemiology to End the HIV Epidemic” in using data to support
effective and tailored approaches to respond to local epidemics and include balanced collaborations between
epidemiologists, data scientists, statisticians, and local health departments and community partners. The key
outputs of the proposed research will include refined, user-centered stigma dashboards integrated into AIDSVu
that allow for data visualization and tools to plan and assess downstream impacts of intervention, as well as

10884937,"This SBIR Fast-track finalizes, tests, and commercializes the Acoustic Implant Protection (AIP) system, which
uses the application of precision acoustic fields to penetrating neural implants to prevent electrode impedance
rise and improve implant longevity. This submission is in response to: Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): NOT-
MH-21-125 Translation of BRAIN Initiative Technologies to the Marketplace.
Problem to be solved: Chronic neural implants hold great potential for illuminating features of neural function,
treating neurological disorders, and enabling the next generation of brain-machine interface-based
neuroprosthetics. Penetrating microelectrode arrays provide direct access to neural signals with high
temporospatial resolution. However, their preclinical and clinical viability are limited by their poor longevity and
variability in functionality due to the immune response or foreign body response (FBR). The FBR can cause
glial scarring and neural cell loss near the electrode sites of penetrating arrays over a period of several weeks,
which are leading causes of signal recording losses through both electrical isolation and spatial distancing
effects. The FBR begins with electrode insertion, when damage to the blood brain barrier activates astrocytes
and microglia. Although ‘soft’ electrode materials, thinner shanks, and floating arrays have been developed to
minimize the mismatch between brain and implant, none of these have demonstrated sufficient recording life
and immunity to the FBR. Exogenous chemical means have been used to directly suppress the FBR, and
have yielded positive results to varying degrees, but limitations of effectiveness, high costs, and/or undesirable
side-effects still exist. A simple approach is needed to mitigate FBR for both preclinical and clinical use.
Solution: Sub-threshold therapeutic ultrasound has recently been shown to have protective and healing effects
in models of cerebral disease and injury, through promotion of neurotrophic factors. AMI successfully
leveraged this principle in an R21 study evaluating low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to mitigate the
microglia response and improve longevity of neural interfaces. Product: This Fast-track delivers an AIP
system for preclinical use with a reusable (releasable) annular transducer that delivers LIPUS to produce a
neuro-protective environment around implanted microelectrodes.
Phase I: Aim 1 – Electronics/System Adaptation for Preclinical Study. Aim 2 – Confirm ultrasound parameters
for AIP annulus that safely stimulate cortical tissues comparable to Alpha design from R21.
Phase I to Phase II Go-no-go. Portable, reusable AIP prototype produces measurable improvement in neural
signal longevity over 6 weeks in preclinical microelectrode study. Positive feedback from potential end users.
Aim 3– Integrate End User Design Feedback and Conduct Verification and Validation. Aim 4 – Optimize
stimulation intervals for neural interface performance (SNR, unit detection) and demonstrate additional neuro-
protective effects (glial cell activation, E-I balance) of LIPUS in preclinical studies."
10880794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tightly regulated microtubule dynamics and polarity are essential for long-term survival of neurons.
Nucleation of new microtubules in axons and dendrites contributes to dynamics and polarity and is also
critical for neuroprotection and dendrite regeneration. In a previous study, Wnt signaling proteins on
endosomes were shown to control microtubule nucleation in dendrites. The current proposal expands on this
finding to answer fundamental questions about neuronal microtubule organization and the relationship
between cell shape and regional specialization. Proposed experiments analyze neurons in their normal
environment and rely on the powerful genetic tools available in the Drosophila model system.
Aim 1. Do surrounding cells control neuronal microtubule nucleation? The finding that Wnt signaling
proteins, including four receptors, are required to position nucleation sites in dendrites raised the possibility
that ligands from surrounding cells could control neuronal microtubule dynamics. Preliminary data suggests
that epithelial cells that contact dendrites are the Wnt source. Aim 1A focuses on confirming that epithelial
Wnts regulate neuronal microtubule nucleation. In Aim 1B the potential that Wnt signaling could tune
nucleation to help neurons respond to injury will be explored.
Aim 2. How are nucleation sites targeted to branch points? The distribution of Wnt signaling endosomes
that control nucleation is non-random in dendrites: they are typically positioned at dendrite branch points. This
localization links neuronal structure directly to regulation of microtubule dynamics. In Aim 2A several different
hypotheses about how Wnt signaling endosomes are localized to branch points will be tested. Potential
mechanisms that could contribute to targeting include local delivery of Wnt receptors or ligands and local
endocytosis. Preliminary data indicates endocytic sites are enriched at dendrite branch points. In Aim 2B this
preliminary data will be used to ask how branch points are recognized as different from the rest of the cell by
the endocytic machinery. Two hypotheses that will be tested are: 1) membrane curvature-recognizing proteins
recruit endocytic proteins to branch points, and 2) the tight curvature of the plasma membrane outside branch
points mechanically restricts endocytosis to branch points.
Aim 3. Axonal parallels: Is axonal microtubule nucleation the same as dendritic? While studies in
invertebrate model systems have provided insights into how microtubules are nucleated in dendrites, these
systems have not yet been used to probe axonal nucleation. In Aim 3A, a sensitized nucleation assay will be
used to determine whether any dendritic nucleation regulators also function in the main axon shaft. In Aim 3B,
nucleation at the neuromuscular junction will be investigated.
Summary: Neuronal microtubule nucleation is still poorly understood, and the proposed experiments will
substantially advance our understanding of this fundamental aspect of neuronal cell biology."
10882930,"The survival of neuronal cells critically depends on the correct function of their lysosomes, catabolic organelles
that play key roles in disposing damaged and harmful cellular components. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a
neurodegenerative and metabolic disease triggered by mutations of the NPC1 gene, which encodes a lysosomal
membrane protein involved in the trafficking and partitioning of cholesterol. In cells lacking NPC1, cholesterol
accumulates aberrantly inside the lysosome, triggering a cascade of downstream events that impact
mitochondria, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Understanding how the molecular details of
the primary lysosomal dysfunction, and the downstream processes that impact mitochondrial homeostasis and
overall cell metabolism is key to the design of more effective and targeted strategies to restore neuronal cell
homeostasis in NPC. Recently, the PI (RZ) and co-Investigator (PO) laboratories have made foundational
discoveries that deepened the current understanding of NPC pathogenesis. In particular, through organelle
immunoisolation and profiling we uncovered a profound impairment in lysosomal proteolysis, hydrolase content
and membrane stability, coupled with defective delivery of damaged mitochondria to the lysosome during
autophagy. Additionally, through initial studies in iPSC-derived patient-specific and NPC1-deleted neurons, we
uncovered a direct connection between alterations of lysosomal function, mitochondrial metabolism and neuronal
failure. Finally, we established that mTORC1, a nutrient-sensing pathway based at the lysosome, becomes
dysregulated in NPC, and that its pharmacological manipulation corrects multiple organelle defects. Combined,
these findings provide a rich and detailed understanding of molecular aspects of NPC pathology. Specifically,
they lead us to hypothesize that the lysosomal cholesterol-mTORC1 pathway we discovered drives loss of
neuronal cell homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in NPC. In order to effectively target the cholesterol-
mTORC1 axis for neuronal resilience and NPC therapy, we propose to i) mechanistically and structurally
elucidate the molecular mechanisms connecting cholesterol levels to mTORC1 regulation, ii) determine how
selectively disabling the cholesterol-mTORC1 sensing pathway impacts mitochondrial metabolism and neuronal
survival in NPC disease models iii) discover new pathways that control organelle function and cellular
metabolism, and evaluate their role as candidate NPC disease modifiers. To accomplish these goals, we will
combine biochemical, cellular and unbiased approaches, including functional genomics and metabolomics in
both neuronal and non-neuronal models of NPC disease. We will rigorously prioritize and validate the most
promising targets, and elucidate their role within the framework of organelle function and neuronal cell
homeostasis. This proposal will deepen our understanding of NPC drivers and disease modifiers, with relevance
to neurodegenerative conditions linked to cholesterol imbalance, such as Alzheimer Disease."
10882931,"Abstract:
 Heart failure (HF) is an expanding health problem, affecting >6.2M Americans, causing >80K deaths and
>800K hospitalizations annually, and costing >$30B each year. HF is genetically complex as there are single-
gene Mendelian (one mutation → causes disease) and disease susceptibility (several variants → influence risk
of disease) models. The broad, long-term objective of our project is to use an integrated analysis approach to
precisely quantify the contributions of rare Mendelian and more common disease susceptibility variants
in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our project is responding to NOT-HL-23-067 (reissue of NOT-HL-21-017),
Integrated Omics Analysis of NHLBI TOPMed Data, and targets the following key knowledge gaps: 1) how do
rare Mendelian-disease and common complex-risk gene HF variants overlap and interact in the pathogenesis of
HF, 2) which complex risk-variants are most likely to be functional (i.e. manifest specific biological mechanisms),
and 3) what additional HF genes remain to be discovered (~50% of genetic HF lacks a pathogenic variant(s)).
 Our approach will leverage a unique whole-genome and whole-transcriptome human heart NHLBI-
sequenced TOPMed dataset (~750 paired DNA/RNA sequenced human samples) using an integrated analysis
approach to dissect the intersection of Mendelian and complex genes and variants. Building on these resources
and approaches we will 1) validate which HR GWAS variants actually affect gene expression in the human heart,
2) discover novel human heart expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) from the cardiac transcriptome in health
and disease, and 3) discover novel HR genes and pathways. Our hypotheses are 1) a subset of published
GWAS HR variants exert direct eQTL mechanistic effects on gene expression in human cardiac tissue, 2) key
genes and pathways of the HR transcriptome are mediated by novel genetic variants that have heretofore not
been identified by GWAS approaches, and 3) integration of published Mendelian and GWAS HR variants in
combination with cardiac tissue eQTL variants will reveal important, novel HR genes.
 Three Specific Aims to test these hypotheses are: 1) Map and validate published GWAS findings onto
the human cardiac transcriptome, 2) Discover novel eQTL DNA variants from HR transcriptomes, and 3)
Discover novel HR genes and perform functional validation studies in human heart tissue and hiPSC-
cardiomyocytes. The impact of these studies will be a comprehensive genetic and RNA expression atlas of
GWAS and eQTL biology in the human non-failing and failing heart models. This work will reveal and validate
novel HR genes and pathways for the development of HR biomarkers and new treatment approaches."
10907846,"Project Summary / Abstract
Deficits in cognitive function and memory are a debilitating aspect of neurodegenerative disease resulting in
long-term disability, enormous suffering to individuals and their families, and significant socioeconomic cost.
Currently, more than 16 million Americans live with cognitive impairment, and this number is expected to continue
rising as the number of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is predicted to double
by 2060. Long-term memory consolidation requires the induction of gene expression in a specific temporal
pattern. Newly synthesized transcripts are translated and folded into functional proteins and then trafficked to
the correct cellular location. Dysfunction in any of these steps can lead to memory impairment and may be
dysregulated in disease conditions, although the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. My long-
term goal is to determine the specific molecular mechanisms through which the Nr4A sub-family regulates gene
expression to control long-term memory in order to develop therapeutic tools to treat AD, which I will pursue as
an independent investigator at a research-focused institution. The overall objective of this proposal is to
determine the mechanisms that link transcriptional regulation and protein folding during memory formation and
how the disruption of these processes contributes to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. My central
hypothesis is that Nr4A regulates genes in specific cell types to facilitate protein folding and memory formation.
I will test this through the following three aims: Specific Aim 1 (K99): identify cell-type specific transcriptional
signatures of memory and identify direct gene targets of Nr4A during memory consolidation using a single-cell
RNA sequencing approach; Specific Aim 2 (K99): determine the role of an Nr4A target, the protein folding
chaperone Hspa5, in memory consolidation and identify its downstream protein targets; Specific Aim 3 (R00):
determine the effect of activating Nr4A transcription factors on memory deficits and gene expression in a mouse
model of Alzheimer's disease. This project provides training in cutting-edge research skills, including
computational analysis of single cell data and chromatin enrichment in memory research. The University of Iowa
is home to experts on memory, computational psychiatry, neurodegeneration, and molecular biology, and the
collaborative environment provides an ideal setting in which to obtain the necessary skills that will allow me to
transition into a successful independent research career. As such, during the mentored (K99) phase, I will
engage in activities designed to prepare me to successfully achieve independence, including training in scientific
presentations, laboratory management skills, grant writing tools, scientific peer-review, and interview/application
preparation. Collectively, this award will provide me with the cutting-edge skills and expertise in molecular
biology, neurodegeneration and behavioral pharmacology necessary to ensure a strong technical and
conceptual foundation to start my independent laboratory investigating mechanisms for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease."
10885100,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The primary cilium is a micron-scale structure that protrudes from the surface of most cells in the human
body. Once thought to be vestigial, the cilium has recently been shown to have key roles in embryonic
development, sensory perception, and tissue homeostasis. Two key functions of cilia give rise to these
physiologic roles: cilia are both organizing centers for diverse signaling pathways and structures whose assembly
and disassembly is tightly linked to progression through the cell cycle. Consistent with these roles, ciliary defects
cause pediatric disorders known as ciliopathies and can promote tumorigenesis. These recent discoveries have
highlighted the importance of cilia but also underscored many gaps in our knowledge. Key questions include:
how are cilia assembled, maintained, and disassembled, how do proteins traffic to and from cilia, how do cilia
promote signaling, and how is cilium disassembly linked to cell cycle progression? At present, many gene
products that support cilium function have yet to be identified or characterized in detail, and thus the answers to
these questions remain elusive.
 My lab aims to understand the molecular basis of mammalian primary cilium function by combining cell-
based assays with new approaches we have developed including CRISPR-based functional screening and in
vitro reconstitution in semi-permeabilized cells. In particular, we recently conducted a genome-wide screen to
identify genes required for cilium-dependent signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This screen
identified hit genes with high precision and sensitivity, revealed new genes required for cilium assembly and Hh
signaling, and suggested new connections between cilia and disease. We now propose to build on this screen
by 1) functionally characterizing newly identified hit genes, including a Rab GTPase that we find to be required
for ciliogenesis and to localize to cilia, and 2) adapting our CRISPR screening tools to systematically investigate
an aspect of cilium function that remains poorly understood: the regulated disassembly of primary cilia. Our work
on cilium disassembly will focus on the hypothesis that cilium disassembly is monitored in a checkpoint-like
manner and may be dysregulated in cases of uncontrolled cell growth, such as during tumorigenesis. In addition
to conducting a genetic screen to identify mediators and regulators of cilium disassembly, we will dissect the
mechanism of disassembly through complementary live-imaging assays and in vitro reconstitution. These latter
experiments will take advantage of a semi-permeabilized cell system I developed that allows powerful
biochemical analysis of ciliary processes, including cilium disassembly.
 Taken together, this project aims to provide fundamental insights into primary cilia that will broaden our
understanding of the cell cycle, protein trafficking, signal transduction, and organelle biogenesis. Additionally,
these studies will help to reveal how ciliary defects contribute to ciliopathies and tumorigenesis."
10885101,"Cancer drug resistance is driven in part by the plasticity of tumor cells that allows for therapy-induced adaptation
of their transcriptional program. This adaptive drug resistance is associated with the acquisition of various
phenotypic changes that promote tumor growth, metastasis and resistance to other therapies. Experimental
drugs targeting CDK8/19 Mediator kinase that regulates transcriptional reprogramming were found to suppress
the development of resistance to different classes of targeted and conventional anticancer agents. We
hypothesize that the emergence of adaptive drug resistance in vitro and in vivo, with concurrent acquisition of
tumor-promoting phenotypes, can be prevented by inhibiting Mediator kinase. We will test this hypothesis in
HER2-positive breast cancers by analyzing the effects of Mediator kinase inhibition on the emergence of
resistance to a HER2-targeting drug (lapatinib) and a conventional drug (paclitaxel). We will pursue the following
Specific Aims. (1) The effect of Mediator kinase deficiency on the development of adaptive drug resistance in
vitro will be analyzed by generating derivatives of HER2-positive human breast cancer cell lines that will express
wild-type or kinase-dead Mediator kinase and by analyzing the effects of Mediator kinase mutagenesis or
treatment with selective CDK8/19 inhibitors on the emergence of adaptive resistance to lapatinib or paclitaxel.
Comprehensive phenotypic, genomic and transcriptomic analyses will be used to evaluate the effect of drug
adaptation and Mediator kinase inhibition on the acquisition of tumor-promoting phenotypes and to identify signal
transduction pathways, inhibitors of which could be combined with CDK8/19 inhibitors to enhance the prevention
of resistance. (2) HER2-positive human cell lines with different Mediator kinase status and a panel of HER2-
positive breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) will be selected for lapatinib and paclitaxel resistance in
vivo, to compare the resistance-preventing effects of Mediator kinase deficiency in tumor cells alone and with
the effects of its pharmacological inhibition in both tumor and stromal cells. Transcriptomic and phenotypic
analysis will be used to delineate the effects of drug selection and Mediator kinase inhibition on gene expression
in tumor and stromal cells. Whole exome sequencing of PDX tumors will reveal if Mediator kinase inhibition
prevents the emergence of new drug-resistant tumor lineages or suppresses the growth of drug-resistant cells
that may pre-exist in heterogeneous PDXs. (3) The effects of Mediator kinase on the emergence of drug
resistance will also be investigated in a murine Her2/Neu-driven mouse mammary carcinoma cells adapted for
syngeneic growth, both in vitro (as in Aim 1) and in vivo using both immunocompetent and immunodeficient
hosts. This analysis will elucidate the effect of the host immune system on drug adaptation and the role of
Mediator kinase in this effect. The proposed program will delineate the roles of Mediator kinase in tumor
adaptation to treatment, in vitro and in vivo, and will indicate whether Mediator kinase-inhibiting drugs may be
able to extend the duration of remission induced by cancer therapy."

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) process lipid-rich pulmonary surfactant and have steady-state immunosuppressive
functions that support lung homeostasis. During infection, AMs can rapidly shift from anti-inflammatory to pro-
inflammatory programs to support pathogen clearance. Dysregulation in the balance of AM anti- and pro-
inflammatory responses leads to increased mortality in bacterial pneumonia. While it is well appreciated that the
lung microenvironment shapes tissue-specific AM function, very little is known about the persistent signaling
events that program AMs in health and disease, which limits our ability to manipulate AMs therapeutically. We
show that Cish, a negative regulator in the SOCS family, is constitutively expressed in AMs. Cish deficient AMs
have a lipid-laden foamy phenotype, increased GATA2 activity, and impaired inflammatory responses to
microbial stimuli. This proposal is centered around defining signaling mechanisms that link lung-specific stimuli
to macrophage function, with a focus on understanding the role of the CISH-GATA2 regulatory node in AM
programming, lung homeostasis, and bacterial pneumonia. Our central hypothesis is that lung cytokines
drive GATA2 activity to promote AM lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory function, and that CISH
inhibits these processes to support functional plasticity in response to infection. In Aim 1, we will
determine mechanisms by which specific steady-state cytokines and associated kinases program AM
metabolism and inflammatory responsiveness. In Aim 2, we will define the role of the CISH-GATA2 regulatory
node in control of AM pro- and anti-inflammatory function during bacterial lung infection and resolution. This work
is significant because it will provide mechanistic insight into signaling processes that underlie AM programming,
a clearly important aspect of lung homeostasis and morbidity associated with pulmonary infection."

schools in one to two high asthma burden Illinois counties. Dr. Pappalardo will assess process-level
implementation and early effectiveness outcomes of a stock inhaler intervention in comparison to the early
adopters across Illinois using the Reach Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance outcomes

10884058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Identifying mechanistic pathways underlying Alzheimer's Disease/Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias
(AD/ADRD) is critical to discovering new targets to test for preventive and therapeutic interventions. Metabolic
dysregulation, both systemic (e.g., diabetes) and cerebral (e.g., dysfunctional lipid/insulin signaling), is
associated with higher dementia risk and AD-related neuropathology. Growing evidence from genetic and
molecular research, and initial studies of metabolomic profiling in postmortem brain tissue, collectively indicate
that metabolic mechanisms may underlie AD/ADRD. However, the specific brain metabolic pathways involved
in AD/ADRD are not well-understood; and critical research gaps remain. First, existing metabolomic studies in
brain tissue – the target organ of dementia – have modest sample sizes and limited replication. Second,
deeper interrogation is needed for brain biochemicals that appear related to brain function (e.g., complex lipids
and fatty acids, lipid mediators of inflammation, gut microbiome-related neurochemicals, glucose/bioenergetic
metabolites). Finally, the plausible causal role of brain metabolic regulation in dementia is yet to be explored.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively examine brain metabolites associated
with cognitive decline. Specifically, we will use clinical, neuropathologic, and genomic data, as well as
postmortem brain tissue from 1,200 deceased individuals from two community-based aging cohorts – the
Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). For the proposed research, we will
leverage existing brain metabolomic data in ROSMAP, and strategically generate new data by extending the
sample size as well as metabolites profiled -- allowing us to examine a total of ~1,800 metabolites across three
platforms. In Aim 1, we will use agnostic discovery to identify and then independently replicate metabolites and
metabolomic coregulatory networks associated with cognitive decline; and we will integrate genetic data using
Mendelian randomization analyses to infer plausible causality. In addition, as a novel approach to discovery, in
Aim 2, we will anchor discovery to a metabolic risk factor for dementia. Specifically, diet is integral to
metabolism, and healthy dietary patterns are associated with slower cognitive decline and lower dementia risk;
thus, we will identify brain metabolomic profiles associated with healthy dietary pattern in MAP, and then test
these profiles in relation to cognitive decline in ROS. We have successfully utilized such approaches in our
prior work. Finally, in the exploratory Aim 3, we will identify metabolomic profiles associated with cognitive
resilience (the ability to maintain cognition despite the presence of neuropathology). IMPACT: Led by an Early-
Stage Investigator and supported by an interdisciplinary team of experienced researchers, this proposal is
poised to discover novel brain metabolic pathways associated with cognitive health, and provide new
evidence that may inform novel interventions. In addition, we will generate extensive brain metabolomics
data to share with the scientific community, yielding a significant and sustained impact on the field."

10888272,"In western Kenya, HIV prevalence is 16% among women in the general population, and 29% among the most
economically constrained women. The HIV/STI epidemic overlaps with broader reproductive health concerns.
Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is a pervasive problem across low- and middle-income countries. In
Phillips-Howards’ survey of over 3,400 women in rural Kenya, two-thirds of women in impoverished settings
state they depend on their sexual partners to provide branded products. Economically vulnerable women at
high risk for HIV and STI are uniquely challenged because many continue to have sex during menses, and
engage in harmful MHM practices, such as vaginal insertion of sponges and cotton to maintain dryness. Led by

microbiome (CST-IV vs. CST-I: aOR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.03–2.86). Over 18 months of observation prior to
COVID-19, girls using menstrual cups to manage menses had 20% higher occurrence of Lactobacillus
crispatus dominated CST-I (aRR=1.29; 95% CI: 1.08–1.53, controlling for age, and baseline STI and sexual
activity). Menstrual cups designed for use during intercourse may help women prevent BV and STIs through
hygienic menstrual practices and avoidance of harmful practices to maintain vaginal dryness during menses.
Objective: This single-arm interventional trial seeks to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of menstrual cups on
non-optimal vaginal microbiome (VMB), BV, and STIs of economically vulnerable women at high risk for STIs
and HIV, assess safety profile, and understand implementation needs. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the impact of
menstrual cups on VMB, BV, and STIs among 402 economically vulnerable women in semi-urban Kenya. In
Aim 2, we will conduct integrated surveillance for enhanced detection of safety endpoints, risk of cup
contamination, and mitigating or facilitating water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) factors. In Aim 3, we will identify
constructs for successful MHM program implementation using an implementation science framework. Future
Directions: The biological protection suggested in a randomized setting, and our findings that unhygienic cloth
use is associated with non-optimal VMB, while menstrual cup use increases optimal VMB composition,
together provide rational justification for this trial, of relevance to economically challenged women globally.
Assessing preliminary efficacy signal in conjunction with implementation characteristics and adverse events,
will generate a comprehensive and necessary foundation for definitive assessment of effectiveness of
menstrual cups as a multipurpose intervention for MHM, and to reduce BV and STIs."

RESEARCH: Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers in the United States, in part due to tumor
plasticity that drives intratumoral heterogeneity and leads to therapy resistance. In order to understand how
plasticity impacts tumors, we profiled single cell transcriptomes from genetically engineered mouse lung tumors
at various stages. We observed a set of reproducible transcriptional states whose diversity increased over time.
Interestingly, we identified and transcriptionally defined a high plasticity cell state that arose in every tumor. We
profiled this cell state and identified a robust potential for phenotypic switching, an increased potential for
spheroid formation in tumor sphere cultures, an increased proliferative potential and tumor forming ability in
allotransplant models, and an enrichment of this plastic cell state after chemotherapeutic stress in vivo. We
identified a similar plastic cell state in both primary human lung adenocarcinoma tumors and patient-derived
xenograft models, and we found the cell state to be associated with worse survival for patients. Thus, our work
suggests that the high plasticity cell state drives tumor progression and resistance to therapy in lung
adenocarcinoma. To better understand the functional role of the high plasticity cell state, I propose to i)
interrogate the function of the high plasticity cell state in lung adenocarcinoma progression and treatment
resistance and ii) define the transcriptional drivers controlling the high plasticity cell state. This work will provide
a functional and molecular definition of the high plasticity cell state, which will provide new therapies for lung
adenocarcinoma.

10889345,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Problem statement: The investigation and manipulation of complex biological systems require lab-on-a-chip
(LOC) systems that can perform spatially resolved, localized sensing (e.g., detection of biomarkers) and
actuation (e.g., micropatterning, and electrical stimulation) on a single entity (e.g., within the surface of a soft
tissue). Faradaic electrochemistry involving reduction/oxidation (redox) reactions is commonly used as the
driving force for these operation modalities and processes. However, array-type electrodes prepared by
conventional lithography-based technologies have limitations in their flexibility as the dimensions, designs, and
locations are tailored to specific tasks, making it difficult to adjust the regions of measurement/manipulation of
dynamic cellular processes as required. Additionally, redesigning these electrodes requires time-consuming,
expensive, and highly sophisticated fabrication and read-out procedures. Furthermore, the predetermined
geometry may limit the achievable density of effective working sites due to the use of conductive
pads/interconnects within the electrode arrays. As a result, there is a need to explore novel LOC systems with
improved resolution, flexibility, and adaptability to shift the paradigm of spatially resolved biosensing and
actuation applications.
Hypothesis: This project aims to develop a photoelectrochemistry-enabled multi-utility lab-on-a-chip (LOC)
system, known as the ""optoelectronic micro-gadget"" (OMG), for sensing and actuation by utilizing cross-
disciplinary expertise in electrical engineering, optoelectronics, and analytical chemistry. The OMG system will
be based on a monolithic, flexible silicon thin film (thickness < 10 μm) and a reconfigurable focused laser beam
for spatially resolved photoexcitation. The working principle is that, when the semiconductor thin-film contacts a
redox solution, a space-charge region develops at the interface due to the Fermi energy level mismatch. A
photoexcitation will result in the generation of electron-hole pairs that are delivered to the semiconductor-
electrolyte interface, causing charge transfer and triggering redox reactions that can be used for amperometric
sensing and actuation in the localized spot. The hypothesis is that the flexible OMG system can achieve accurate
light-induced sensing and actuation within a single entity of curvilinear surfaces at a cellular or sub-cellular
dimension scale, and thus can serve as a powerful tool for biomedical investigation supporting multiple operation
modalities such as biosensing, micropatterning, pH regulation and electrical stimulation. The study will include
the following aims:
Aim 1: Develop flexible photoelectrodes supporting light-induced redox reactions.
Aim 2: Integrate the photoelectrodes with an optical system and test the feasibility of conducting spatially
resolved, localized photoelectrochemistry.
Aim 3: Evaluate performance/multifunctionality of “OMG” for applications in neuroscience & other fields."
10886201,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, prevalent and disabling condition. The only medications that
work as monotherapy for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This reflects an incomplete understanding of
the underlying cause(s) of the disorder and, accordingly, lack of mechanistically-defined targets for intervention.
The goal of this application is to provide initial proof-of-concept for a novel target in OCD, based on exciting
novel observations in a mouse model of OCD, the Sap90/PSD95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3) null mouse,
now confirmed in a second genetic mouse model of OCD, the SLIT and NTRK-like protein-5 [Slitrk5] null mice.
Our data in the Sapap3 mouse model, acquired by co-PI Joshua Plotkin, shows clear evidence for a link between
the cholinergic system in the striatum and OCD-like symptoms as well as their treatment. In this mouse model
we observe the following: 1) increased density of the cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum, 2)
upregulation of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vAChT), 3) increase in ACh release in the striatum which
corresponds to compulsive motor behavior. Furthermore, reducing striatal ACh release, by virally knocking down
the vAChT within the dorsal striatum, mitigates the development of OCD-like symptoms. These novel data,
showing abnormalities in the cholinergic system in the striatum of a valid mouse model of the disease that relate
to emergence and treatment of OCD-like behavior, warrant a translational investigation of the cholinergic system
in patients with OCD to probe for the possibility of cholinergic involvement in patients suffering from this
devastating disease.
Based on these observations we hypothesize that striatal ACh release capacity, as measured by vAChT density,
is elevated in patients with OCD, and the magnitude of elevation relates to severity of OCD symptoms. We
propose to scan 10 patients with OCD and 10 demographically matched controls with the newly developed
vAChT Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer, [18F]VAT.
This is a high-risk high reward novel investigation, based on robust preliminary data, that has the potential to
identify the striatal cholinergic system as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in OCD. If successful, this
proposal will inform the design of a larger study and provide POC for investigation of the cholinergic system in
OCD. New therapies are urgently needed in OCD. Alternative or additional therapies to SRT drugs will improve
the quality of life for patients suffering from this devastating disease."

 Mutations in DDX3X are associated with autism spectrum disorder, brain malformations, and epilepsy,
and account for up to 3% of cases of females with unexplained intellectual disability. However, little is currently
known about the molecular mechanism linking DDX3X mutations to neurodevelopmental disease. DDX3X
encodes an RNA helicase of the DEAD-box protein family and has been implicated in many aspects of RNA
metabolism, yet we still lack a mechanistic understanding of DDX3X’s role in these processes, as well as how
patient mutations in DDX3X affect RNA metabolism.
 To address this gap in knowledge of understanding of how DDX3X mutations perturb cellular function
and contribute to neurodevelopmental disease, we will investigate the mechanism of how DDX3X regulates its
target transcripts both at the level of translation initiation and mRNA nuclear export, and study how pathogenic
mutations in DDX3X alter these processes. DDX3X is implicated in translation initiation as it binds to 5’UTRs of
mRNAs, and is required for the efficient translation of a subset of mRNAs with structured 5’UTRs. However, we
still do not know the mechanism of how DDX3X can regulate the translation of these mRNAs. In addition to its
role in translation, DDX3X has been implicated in nuclear mRNA processing, and our preliminary data show
that the genes in the mRNA export pathway are genetic interaction partners of DDX3X. However, we still do
not understand what the function of DDX3X is in the nucleus or mRNA export. We hypothesize that DDX3X
regulates its target transcripts through both unwinding secondary structures in their 5’UTRs and chaperoning
their nuclear export.
 To answer this hypothesis, in our first aim we will determine how DDX3X impacts mRNA transcript
structure and ribosome engagement by measuring RNA secondary structure through in vivo structure-specific
chemical modification and high-throughput sequencing. In our second aim, we will determine the function of
DDX3X in the nucleus by examining nuclear export of DDX3X -sensitive mRNAs using RNA FISH staining.
Upon successful completion of the proposed experiments, we will have gained a greater understanding the
precise mechanism of how DDX3X regulates RNA metabolism both at the level of translation initiation as well
as mRNA export. This knowledge is critical for advancing our knowledge of RNA metabolism, as well as
understanding and developing treatments for patients with DDX3X syndrome."

This project is proposed to respond to Provocative Question 6 in RFA-CA-19-032.
Objective: Paracrine transformation is a theoretical concept that was proposed years ago to explain the
unconventional “non-autonomous” oncogenesis observed during development of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), one of
the most common AIDS-associated malignancies. This proposal is designed to prove its existence, to dissect its
mechanism, identify the players therein, and to define its roles in KS tumorigenesis using our novel animal
models and an engineered microphysiological platform.
Rationale: Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) causes an endothelial cell tumor, KS, in the skin and internal
organs. A paradox in KS oncogenesis is that while most KS tumor cells are latently infected with minimal viral
gene expression, only lytic-stage cells express vGPCR, the only known viral oncogene that is necessary and
sufficient for KS development.
Provocative Question: How vGPCR, a lytic viral gene expressed in cells destined to die, can cause cancer?
Challenges: This question remained unanswered due to the lack of proper animal models, engineered in vitro
or ex vivo systems to study pathogenesis, persistence, and tumor development that recapitulate this HIV/AIDS-
associated malignancies.
Innovation & Strategy: We have developed a series of novel animal models and Vascularized Skin Chip
platform. Using these technical advancements, we will prove the existence of paracrine transformation, identify
its cellular (immune cells, HIV) and molecular (vGPCR-loaded exosome) players, and characterize its
mechanism as the main oncogenic driver for KS tumorigenesis.
Impact: Our study will address the decades-long conundrum on KS tumor development by defining the
existence and mechanism of paracrine transformation. This provocative concept of paracrine transformation
will not only force us to move our focus beyond the lytic-infected cells as the oncogenic drivers, but also
expand the way we understand the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. In addition, this study will
open a new door to novel anti-KS therapeutics, and provide a solid justification to investigate the presence of
equivalent non-autonomous transformation in other non-viral oncogenesis, such as breast and colon cancers."

 Despite significant advances in Immuno-Oncology (IO) treatments, lung cancers with loss-of-function
mutations in STK11, comprising 20-30% of cases, demonstrate poor prognosis due to resistance to these
strategies. Our proposal targets the interaction between specific tumor 'differentiation phenotypes' and immune
resistance pathways, associated with STK11-Deficient lung cancers. Firstly, we've found that these
differentiation phenotypes drastically influence the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME)
and the patient's response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Furthermore, we've developed STK11-MLDD,
a novel biomarker that measures these differentiation phenotypes and may predict ICB benefit. Secondly, we've
identified the immune regulator TRAF2 and its partner cIAP1 as promoters of immune resistance, specifically in
the context of STK11 deficiency, and appear to be linked to the neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype. These
findings provide the foundation for our two complementary aims.
 Aim 1 focuses on characterizing the interaction between tumor differentiation phenotypes, corresponding
immune TME phenotypes, and clinical response to ICB. We'll validate the STK11-MLDD biomarker in multiple
patient cohorts and develop it as a clinical tool for future trials. Additionally, using flow cytometry and single cell
RNAseq data, we will identify specific suppressive immune cell populations and resistance phenotypes in the
TME associated with different STK11-MLDD differentiation subsets. Aim 2 centers on understanding
TRAF2/cIAP1-mediated immune evasion and validating TRAF2 as a potential clinical target in lung cancer. We'll
conduct experiments evaluating changes in TNF signaling resulting from STK11 loss and TRAF2/cIAP1,
assessing their impact on anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, we will conduct in vivo experiments to examine
STK11-/TRAF2-mediated effects on the TME and the potential for TRAF2 inhibition to enhance ICB response.
 We anticipate that our results will establish TRAF2/cIAP1 inhibition as a promising clinical target for STK11-
deficient lung cancer, while also defining novel mechanisms of immune resistance and additional precision
treatment candidates for these cancers. Furthermore, the STK11-MLDD biomarker is expected to have use not
only as a clinical predictor of ICB response, but also potentially as a ‘treatment-selective’ biomarker that could
be used to identify patients likely to respond to precision approaches such as cIAP1 inhibition.
 As a physician-scientist in thoracic oncology, my career goal is to become a successful independent
academic investigator, focusing on STK11-mutated NSCLC to improve treatments and outcomes for patients
with these cancers. We have outlined a detailed mentorship and career development plan that will complement
my scientific approaches and promote mastery of skills necessary for my long-term success, with specific focus
in the areas of 1) bioinformatics and biostatistics, 2) tumor immunology and immune oncology, 3) academic
leadership. Achieving these goals will accelerate my success and maximize my long-term impact in the field."
10887316,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Two component gene regulatory systems (TCS), which generally consist of a membrane-embedded sensor
kinase which controls the phosphorylation of its cognate response regulator, are a central mechanism by which
bacteria modulate gene expression in response to external stimuli. The control of virulence regulator/sensor
kinase (CovRS) of the major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) has long been a model for
understanding how TCS influence bacterial infectivity. Phosphorylated CovR (CovR~P) primarily serves to
repress virulence factor production, and CovS can either phosphorylate or dephosphorylate CovR at D53 in
response to extracellular factors. Recent completion of global CovR binding/transcriptome analyses (ChIP-
seq/RNAseq) showed that CovR~P repressed virulence factor encoding genes have the expected increased
CovR promoter binding and decreased transcript levels at high CovR~P levels. However, these studies also
identified a large number of directly CovR regulated genes with increased transcript quantity at higher CovR~P
levels (i.e. CovR~P activated). By ChIP-seq analyses, these CovR~P activated genes had higher CovR
promoter occupancy at lower CovR~P levels suggesting that non-phosphorylated CovR (CovR-NP) may be the
predominant CovR isoform binding/acting at these promoters. Additionally, we have identified that ska, which
encodes the critical GAS virulence factor streptokinase, is CovR~P repressed in emm1 strains but CovR~P
activated in acapsular emm28, emm87, and emm89 strains. It is the goal of this proposal to elucidate
mechanisms underlying “CovR~P activation”. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to perform comparative ChIP-exo
analyses of wild-type (~80% CovR~P) and CovR-D53A (100% CovR-NP) emm1 and emm89 strains to better
define the contribution of CovR-NP to global CovR binding. ChIP-exo provides an advance over ChIP-seq
because of an exonuclease digestion step which greatly improves identification of the precise DNA binding
location of transcriptional regulators. Additionally, we will perform focused in vitro transcription assays and
luminescence-based plasmid reporter studies to definitively test the comparative function of CovR-NP and
CovR~P at specific CovR~P activated promoters. In specific aim 2, we will seek to determine the mechanism
by which ska is CovR~P repressed in emm1 but CovR~P activated in emm89 GAS. Specifically, we will perform
in vitro transcription assays using CovR~P and CovR-NP as well as in vivo promoter activity assays using emm1
and emm89 ska promoter DNA in low and high CovR~P emm1 and emm89 strains. Moreover, we will swap the
emm1 and emm89 promoters (i.e. place the emm1 promoter into an emm89 strain) to discern the role of strain
background on observed transcript level variation as well as assess the role of the non-coding ska regulatory
RNA fasX. Completion of the proposed research will markedly improve mechanistic understanding of how a
model prokaryotic response regulator activates gene expression."

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults
affecting approximately one million individuals only in the United States. The pathophysiology of
MS remains unclear. Infection with the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is epidemiologically a pre-
requisite for developing MS, as essentially all MS patients become infected with EBV before the
onset of the disease. The Robinson lab at Stanford recently identified molecular mimicry between
the EBV transcription factor EBNA1 and the glial cellular adhesion molecule GlialCAM in 20-25%
of MS patients, which is likely a critical mechanism underlying the development of MS in this
subset of patients. The proposed project will investigate the differences (presence/absence and
the levels) in antibodies reactive to different EBV proteins with the potential for immunogenicity,
using large patient cohorts. This study also aims to define the role of EBV reactivation and anti-
EBV antibodies in relapse and progression of MS as well as response to treatment. The detailed
education and training plan for this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award will give the candidate, Dr. Sattarnezhad, the necessary skills to reach this
goal by confirming three specific Aims. Aim 1 will characterize MS cohorts using proteomic
analysis of the anti-EBV antibodies and neurodegenerative markers to investigate the role of EBV
molecular mimicry in MS etiopathogenesis; Aim 2 will define the role of EBV reactivation in the
disease activity in MS patients; and Aim 3 will perform integrated informatics analysis of the finding
from Aims 1 and 2 to investigate the association between anti-EBV antibody levels with genetic,
clinical, and imaging data of MS patients. Success of the proposed studies would elucidate the
role of EBV in MS, which will transform our understanding of MS and can lead to fundamental
therapies for the treatment of MS. The proposed career development plan will also provide Dr.
Sattarnezhad with the support and training to become an independent clinician-scientist in
neuroimmunology."

a diverse pool of trainees with the instruction, experience, and career development support needed for
successful careers in genetics and cell biology. Objectives of the program include recruiting outstanding
graduate trainees from diverse backgrounds to the training program and providing them with comprehensive
didactic training, state-of-the-art research skills, and professional skills needed for careers in the biomedical
science workforce. Incorporated into the training plan are recurring training in responsible conduct of research
and mechanisms to increase retention and reduce time-to-degree.
We propose to support 12 pre-doctoral trainees per year in their second and third year of training: 6 in year two
and 6 in year three. The applicant pool is outstanding, including many students with accomplished
undergraduate records, extensive research experience and a strong interest in genetics and cell biology. The
49 faculty trainers are accomplished scientists, including 3 Nobel laureates and 19 members of the US
National Academy of Sciences, with a shared interest and experience in graduate education. The
interdisciplinary nature of the program encourages trainees to perform collaborative work in various areas with
different faculty. Trainees would be mentored by the Program Directors; a Program Advisory Committee of
selected faculty for general curriculum and research advice; and a Faculty Advisory Committee, specifically
designed for each trainee to provide detailed experimental guidance. An External Advisory Committee will
evaluate the effectiveness of the program and provide advice on new initiatives.
Our past trainees have been highly successful, with most continuing in biomedical research careers. Upon

This project will develop a powerful integrated database for studying global transformations of maternal and child
health. Building on the IPUMS model, the project will harmonize Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) across
countries of the Global South and Eastern Europe, creating consistent microdata and documentation. MICS
include data representing over half the world's children and women, with survey data from over 90 countries
dating back to the late 1990s. Collected via partnerships between the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and participating countries, MICS were the first large-scale comparative surveys to focus on many topics of
critical importance to children, such as child labor and experiences with violent discipline. While other global
health surveys largely ignore the crucial years between age five and 14, older children and adolescents are a
core sample component in MICS. In addition, MICS are the only global surveys that routinely gather extensive
health information on orphans, who constitute upwards of 17% of young children in some sub-Saharan African
countries. The surveys also extend beyond children to consider the fertility preferences, health behaviors,
knowledge, and well-being of adults age 15-49. Nearly always representative at the national and regional levels,
MICS are also exceptional for constructing representative samples of marginalized communities within countries,
such as refugees, individuals in areas affected by conflict, and minority groups. Despite the immense value of
MICS, there are currently major barriers to using the MICS microdata. Variable names, response codes, value
labels, and universes are inconsistent across countries and over time within the same country. Information is
divided unpredictably among multiple files (e.g., women, household members, children). Documentation on such
key issues as question wording, file-linking directions, weighting issues, and sampling is unstandardized and
dispersed. For one-quarter of MICS surveys, documentation, as well as variable and value labels, is available in
French, Portuguese, or Spanish only.
The project will freely disseminate the harmonized microdata through a user-friendly Internet access tool,
allowing researchers to design comparative studies in an information-rich environment. This integrated MICS
(IPUMS MICS) will dramatically reduce the effort required to conduct and replicate sophisticated cross-national
and cross-temporal analyses with the microdata. By eliminating duplicated effort, it will promote the cost-effective
use of scarce resources for demographic and health research. It will reduce errors introduced when researchers
combine datasets without fully understanding incompatibilities. Most importantly, IPUMS MICS will stimulate new
investigations on topics directly related to the mission of NICHD, helping us understand the profound changes
in maternal and child health and well-being that are reshaping the world."

A critical element to ensure new advances that translate research from bench to bedside in head and neck
cancer is to attract, foster and support new investigators in this area. The Career Enhancement Program (CEP)
of the Yale Head and Neck SPORE has this as its core goal. The communities of Yale, University of North
Carolina and Fox Chase Cancer Center provide an ideal environment to promote this program. Each institution
is strongly committed to promoting basic, translational and clinical cancer research. There is an exceptional
pool of junior faculty, fellows and established investigators with outstanding potential to advance translational
head and neck cancer research, plus a dedicated cohort of established head and neck investigators to serve
as mentors and collaborators. To ensure that there will be a pipeline of new, improved and much needed
therapies to offer to head and neck cancer patients, it is essential to increase the workforce of translational
researchers who are driven to gain greater understanding of this disease and motivated to develop new
treatments to reduce head and neck cancer morbidity and mortality. To achieve this the specific aims of the
CEP are (1) to identify, support and mentor promising early career basics and translational investigators to
work in head and neck cancer, (2) to enhance the careers of established investigators who have newly-defined
interest in pursuing translational research in head and neck cancer, and (3) to contribute to the development of
a diverse head and neck cancer translational work force. This is of particular importance for a cancer which
disproportionately burdens communities of color, such as those in the communities surrounding our cancer
centers in New Haven, Chapel Hill and Philadelphia. The CEP will support up to four awardees per year who
will receive up to $50,000 per year to support their research career enhancement activities. These awardees
will be drawn for the Yale, UNC and FCCC communities, selected through a careful and well-defined process,
and supported by the expertise and resources of the YHN-SPORE community. These CEP awardees will go on
to take their place in the next generation of physician scientists and translational researchers dedicated to
address the most urgent issues in head and neck cancer."

We propose to investigate motivations for methamphetamine injection, associations of its co-use with
fentanyl and infectious disease risk, and the underlying causes of death for methamphetamine overdose in
San Francisco (SF) and Oakland (OAK), California. All major indicators point to a steep increase in
methamphetamine use in the United States (US). From 2015 to 2018, 1.6 million US adults reported past-
year methamphetamine use, of which 22% reported injecting methamphetamine. When the US experienced
a large increase in methamphetamine use in the late 1990s and 2000s, the motivations for its use and
attendant health risks were well characterized. However, the introduction of illicitly made fentanyl into drug
markets in the US in the past 5 years has significantly altered the context in which methamphetamine is now
used. What is being termed the “fourth wave of the opioid epidemic” is a surge in co-use of fentanyl and
methamphetamine. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fentanyl and its analogs are so potent that people are
motivated to co-use methamphetamine to overcome the heavy sedation that accompanies fentanyl use.
Consequently, our understanding of the motivations for methamphetamine injection must be updated within
this new context. We also need to update our understanding of how people who inject methamphetamine are
at increased risk for infectious diseases during the fentanyl era. While the data from the 1990s and 2000s
showed increased syringe sharing and sexual risks, it is unclear whether these persist in the new wave of
methamphetamine injection and its co-use with fentanyl. As opposed to opioid overdose deaths, which are
caused by respiratory depression, we know little about the distribution of underlying causes of death in
methamphetamine overdoses. The only US epidemiological study showed that the most common additional
causes of death were cerebral hemorrhage (15%) and cardiac conditions (6%). That study predated the co-
use of fentanyl, after which overdose deaths have surged. If we do not know why people who use
methamphetamine are dying, we cannot address how to prevent such deaths. Aim 1: To characterize
motivations for methamphetamine injection. Aim 2: To assess the association of methamphetamine and
fentanyl co-use with infectious disease risk behaviors. Aim 3: To determine the distribution of underlying
causes of death among people whose cause of death includes acute methamphetamine toxicity. To achieve
Aims 1 and 2, we will recruit a community-based cohort of 800 people who inject drugs using targeted
sampling methods in SF and OAK. We will conduct surveys at baseline and monthly for 6 months, using 7-
day timeline follow-back methods. To achieve Aim 3, we will determine cause of death of all overdose
fatalities involving methamphetamine from 2016 to 2024 by reviewing medical examiner records in SF
(estimated N=500). Findings will provide rigorous empirical evidence to policymakers, health departments,
and agencies working with people who inject methamphetamine to mitigate attendant health risks."

Our long-term goal is to understand the relationship between peripheral and central changes in the auditory
system during age-related hearing loss (ARHL). GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter critical for precise
temporal processing, is downregulated in the central auditory system during aging. This loss of GABA has
been best documented in the inferior colliculus (IC), an auditory nucleus that gives rise to ascending circuits
that carry temporally precise signals to the auditory cortex for perception and descending circuits that play a
pivotal role in the temporal processing of interpreting speech from noise. Recent studies hypothesize that the
downregulation of GABA is a homeostatic response to “re-up” the gain in central neurons as the cochlear input
is diminished. However, our understanding of GABAergic function in the aging IC is inadequate due to the lack
of information about the relationship of GABA loss to increasing hearing deficits, about which specific IC
circuits lose GABA, and how those circuits respond during aging.
Our central hypothesis is that age-related GABAergic downregulation in the IC occurs prior to the onset of
auditory processing deficits and in two stages: an initial loss of GABA prior to age-related auditory processing
deficits that is associated with descending IC circuits, and a subsequent loss associated with the ascending IC
circuits. The objective of this proposal is to determine where in the IC age-related changes of GABA occur and
if so, do these changes occur before the onset of auditory processing deficits. The experiments will combine
data from gap detection using the prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle, envelope following responses,
auditory brainstem responses, immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy-intersectional viral tracing to
determine age-related GABAergic changes in the IC that occur before hearing deficits. Examining the
relationship between the loss of GABAergic cells, boutons and synapses in the aging IC before the onset of
hearing deficits is the focus of Aim 1. Aim 2 will determine if specific IC circuits lose GABAergic input with age
and if so, when those losses occur relative to each other. Aim 3 will identify when inhibitory and excitatory IC
circuits change their GABAA receptor subunit composition to compensate for the declining levels of GABAergic
input during ARHL.
Data generated from these three Aims will move the field forward by establishing precise points in time when
age-related changes in specific circuits of the central auditory system occur in relation to hearing loss. The
results will provide essential information for designing and interpreting future experiments with viral tracing,
physiology and behavior to investigate GABAergic function in the aging auditory system."
10884616,"ABSTRACT. Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is highly debilitating and common, but without established treatments.
Individuals with CUD show elevated activity to cocaine cues in the ventral striatum (VS), a key region in the
prefrontal cortex-striatal reward network (RNet) supporting reward valuation, other RNet regions, and the dorsal
anterior cortex-insula salience network (SN). This pattern of elevated activity is positively associated with craving
and years of cocaine use. Carefully-monitored studies show that transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a safe
intervention that has the advantage over other neuromodulation techniques of being able to target deep
subcortical structures, such as the VS. tFUS is thus a promising intervention for CUD, and other neurological
and psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormally elevated subcortical activity. Yet, no studies have
determined whether the VS can be modulated by tFUS. We propose a proof-of-concept study targeting the VS
with tFUS, as a promising way to develop new device-based interventions for individuals with CUD, in accord
with PAR-20-279. Our first goal is to determine that VS engagement by tFUS is possible (UG3 phase) in 25
healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years; VS tFUS [and same hemisphere sham] laterality counterbalanced across
participants). We will use a reward task that reliably activates the VS to reward prediction error (PE), the
difference between the expected and actual reward, in healthy individuals, where greater VS activity to reward
PE is associated with higher levels of impulsive decision-making, a behavioral trait predisposing to substance
use disorders. Greater VS activity to reward PE in healthy individuals is thus a neural marker of substance use
disorder risk, as well as a target for tFUS. We will then (UH3 phase) perform a sham-controlled trial to determine
the effects of VS tFUS on neural responses to cocaine cues and cocaine craving in 40 individuals with CUD. In
UG3, we aim: 1. To determine in healthy individuals target engagement of the VS by tFUS, and the duration and
tolerability of the intervention. We will measure: a) how VS tFUS vs. sham tFUS impacts VS activity and VS-
RNet and VS-SN functional connectivity (FC) to reward PE with fMRI; and b) if it has lingering effects on neural
network measures, and adverse effects. tFUS positioning and delivery will be guided by neuronavigation and
individualized simulation of the US field of stimulation; 2. To finalize all regulatory approvals for UH3, including
protocol approval by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, and an Investigational Device
Exemption by the FDA, for tFUS use in individuals with CUD. In UH3, we aim: 3. To determine the effects of VS
vs. sham tFUS on neural responses to cocaine cues and cocaine craving in individuals with CUD. We will
measure: a) how VS tFUS vs. sham tFUS affects VS activity and VS- RNet and SN FC to cocaine cues; and b)
if these neural changes are associated with changes in cocaine craving. We will also assess lingering and
adverse effects, as in UG3. tFUS delivery and positioning will be as in UG3. The study will pave the way for the
development of chronic, repeated administration VS tFUS treatment protocols for CUD."
10886562,"Summary: Genetic mutations of the dim-light visual pigment, rhodopsin (Rho), cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP),
and no effective pharmacological treatment is available for this inherited retinal degeneration. Our long-term
goal is to determine the molecular events that contribute to photoreceptor death in RP and develop effective
small molecule drugs targeting these events that preserve the retinal structure and visual function. Rho protein
misfolding causes rod cell death in RP. Our central hypothesis is: small molecules that stabilize Rho structure,
or those induce degradation of misfolded Rho can mitigate Rho-associated adRP. We recently discovered two
novel and potent lead compounds: 1) YC-001, a non-retinal chaperone of Rho that rescues folding of multiple
misfolded Rho mutants that cause RP; and 2) a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that
induces misfolded Rho degradation in vitro, and that possesses potent anti-inflammatory activity. Using the
well-studied Rho P23H knock-in mouse model of RP, we will determine the efficacy, mechanism of action, and
safety of these two compounds firstly in the isolated retinae explant culture, and then in vivo by an intravitreal
injection of YC-001 encapsulated in a controlled drug release formula, or via intermittent intravitreal injections
of the FDA-approved drug with optimized intervals. We will utilize state-of-the-art retinal imaging and
electrophysiology techniques to evaluate the retinal structure and visual function. We will conduct biochemical
and transcriptome analyses to identify the drug targeting pathways that regulate rhodopsin homeostasis. The
results from this study will provide comprehensive pharmacological profiles of the two lead compounds in a
rodent model of adRP, from which we will build a clear molecular network connecting rhodopsin expression,
folding, degradation and retinal inflammation with the progression of retinal degeneration and we will assess
the efficacy of these compounds as potential treatments for RP."

10910933,"Project Summary: Rafiou Agoro, PhD is a molecular and cellular biologist whose overarching career goal is to
identify promising therapeutic targets relevant for the prevention/treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The
proposed research in this K99/R00 application aims to identify novel pathways involved in the control of renal
oxidative stress with translational applicability on halting CKD progression and improving patient outcomes.
Candidate: Dr. Agoro completed a PhD in Immunology at Orléans University (France) followed with a fellowship
at NYU before joining Dr. White’s lab at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) as a postdoctoral fellow.
Dr. Agoro’s previous work identified iron metabolism and inflammatory mechanisms involved in tuberculosis,
asthma, and CKD pathogeneses giving him the strong background knowledge required to conduct the proposed
research. In addition, Dr. Agoro outlined a career development roadmap in building skills in bioinformatics during
the K99 phase with a vision of leveraging novel technologies to understand the pathogenesis of CKD as an
independent investigator. Dr. Agoro proposes four career goals during the K99/training phase: 1) To master the
scATACseq analytic pipelines; 2) To generate conditional mouse models; 3) To successfully find a faculty
position and 4) To develop leadership and professional skills in communication. Further Dr. Agoro will undergo
training activities that include didactic and experiential learning to enable him to gain the necessary skills for
genomic data analyses. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Agoro and his primary mentor, Dr. White, PhD, have
assembled a strong team formed with a co-mentor, collaborators, advisor, and consultant to assist Dr. Agoro
through the proposed training, research activities, and faculty job search. The proposed career development
plan will utilize the intellectual and bioinformatics resources at IUSM. In addition, Dr. Agoro will attend national
meetings, as well as seminars/courses and workshops locally. Research: CKD is an important public health
epidemic affecting approximately 37 million Americans. CKD disease progression is associated with a graded
increase in oxidative stress driving highly adverse complications. This proposal will decipher novel pathways
involved in renal stress control via the following specific aims: Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms by which
Klotho-dependent FGF23 signaling regulates HMOX1. In Aim 2, Dr. Agoro will test the role of Klotho and Hmox1
in CKD pathogenesis with a specific focus on renal oxidative stress, iron metabolism and mitochondria function.
Summary: The proposed research will profile the genome-wide chromatin accessibility of renal proximal tubule
in Klotho-transgenic vs WT mice and study the effects of Klotho-dependent FGF23 signaling on Nrf2 binding to
ARE elements. Dr. Agoro will also determine the role of the FGF23-Klotho-Hmox1 axis on renal oxidative stress
during CKD. In sum, this comprehensive plan will provide Dr. Agoro with the training needed to conduct
independent research using genomic and transcriptomic approaches to improve CKD patient outcomes."

10889781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), the two major types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are
chronic diseases with recurrent symptoms and significant morbidity. There exists a lack of efficient medications
for IBD, primarily due to either limited efficacy or side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need to
develop new effective treatments for IBD. Our compelling data using murine IBD models and human IBD patient
samples demonstrated that activation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), an epigenetic regulator, is
critical to the initiation of colonic inflammation in IBD. BRD4 inhibition reduces the inflammatory response but
does not affect the anti-apoptotic response, making this strategy much safer and better tolerated (Preliminary
data). Inhibition of BRD4 activation is an attractive target for the development of superior therapeutics for IBD,
especially for anti-TNFα-resistant patients. We have demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition blocks the pathological
activation of the BRD4 signaling, leading to the suppression of colonic inflammation in several murine models of
IBD and human samples of IBD patients. Our overall objective is to develop BRD4 inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles
for targeted therapy to areas of active colonic inflammation. For this purpose, we used several approaches to
guide the design of colon mucosal inflammation-targeted nanoparticles. In our pilot studies, we have successfully
encapsulated our new generation BRD4 inhibitors ZL0513, ZL0591, and ZL0742 into biodegradable
nanoparticles using FDA-approved polymers. No apparent cell death was detected in human colonic epithelial
cells (HCECs) and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) incubated with nano-encapsulated
BRD4 inhibitors up to 40 μM. Also, the results of in vivo drug release tests of Nano-BRD4 inhibitors indicate their
good DMPK potential. Furthermore, Nano-encapsulated BRD4 inhibitor PLGA-ZL0513 blocked the colonic
inflammation at a very low dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.) in a murine IBD model of Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
colitis. We hypothesize that local delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated BRD4 inhibitors targeted to areas of
active colonic inflammation will offer superior pharmacotherapy for IBD with higher efficacy, specific delivery,
long-lasting release, and a safer therapeutic window. In this project, we will pursue the following two Specific
Aims: Inspired by our compelling pilot data, we will compare the in vivo efficacy of nano-encapsulated BRD4
inhibitors with that of their non-encapsulated form on chronic colonic inflammation in murine models that mimic
epithelial injury (DSS-induced colitis) and immunopathogenesis of IBD (both OXA-induced and Cbir1 T cell
transfer chronic colitis) (Aim 1). We will evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of nano-encapsulated BRD4 inhibitors
in multiple cell lines and their in vivo acute and chronic toxicity for safety studies in animals. The DMPK profile
improvement (e.g., oral bioavailability and safety) by drug delivery with nanoparticles will also be examined (Aim
2). The proposed studies will lay a solid foundation as the first step in developing a first-in-class orally effective
nano-medication by targeting BRD4 inhibition to improve the treatment of patients with IBD."

Sacramento County, California, is one of the counties with the largest arrivals of Arabic-speaking refugees
and Afghan and Iraqi special immigrant visa holders (SIVs) in the nation. Post-resettlement unemployment
and poverty, poor English skills, socioeconomic pressures, cultural differences, lack of familiarity with
preventive services, and inability to navigate the maze of the US health care system pose substantial barriers
to refugee access to needed reproductive health (RH) care leading to disparities in maternal and infant
health outcomes and to higher cervical cancer rates. An important factor to achieve health equity for
refugees and SIVs is access to accurate and understandable information on sexual and reproductive health
needs and services. In this 3-year study. With expert and outreach support from the Digital Scholarship
Services of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the Sacramento Public Library, the California's
Refugee Reproductive Health Network (ReproNet) will leverage its solidly established regional academic –
refugee community partnerships to enhance Afghan and Arab refugee women's knowledge and access to
accurate and linguistically appropriate RH information. Key ReproNet partners in this study will be the
University of California, Davis and Muslim American Society Social Services Foundation (MAS-SSF). In this
project, ReproNet will aim to: (1) Create a publicly-available digital repository of multilingual
reproductive health resources (Dari, Pashto, Arabic) for Afghan and Arab refugee populations. Links to
the materials of the repository will be posted on ReproNet’s social media pages and channels. The repository
will be housed at the UCI DSS which will also maintain and store the resource materials beyond the project
period. (2) Enhance Afghan and Arab refugee’s reproductive health literacy (RHL) in California through 12
in-person training sessions with the Sacramento Public Library and MAS-SSF (3 each in Dari, Pashto, Arabic
and English) and 12 on-line training sessions offered via zoom or Facebook and (3) Increase the capacity
of refugee providers to integrate reproductive health literacy in their programs. We will evaluate the
project through google analytics, session evaluations, and pre- and post RHL and provider training
assessments. An enhanced literacy and access to digital health information and library resources
nationwide will strengthen refugee women’s capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic RH health
information needed to make optimal health decisions for themselves and their families."
10891559,"Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) often present with limited literacy achievement
which results in an absence of opportunities to foster written language development (Moni et al., 2011).
However, when young adults with IDD are provided opportunities to broaden their literacy education even after
high school, they continue to develop and improve their written and spoken language skills, which is
associated with improved vocational and independent living options (Erickson 2006; Hua et al., 2019). To date,
few studies have examined effective communication interventions for the often underrepresented population of
young adults with IDD. The objective of the proposed study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and
initial effectiveness of a functional written language intervention embedded in naturally occurring daily activities
(e.g., text messages, emails) for young adults with IDD. The central hypothesis is: (a) that explicit written
language intervention for functional texts (WLIFT) will result in greater use of reading comprehension
strategies before, during, and after reading and (b) that use of reading comprehension strategies will be
associated with improvements in written and spoken language outcomes. The specific aims include (1)
examining the effects of WLIFT intervention on use of reading comprehension strategies in functional texts by
young adults with IDD, 2) examining the effects of the intervention on distal written language outcomes, and
(3) examining the effects of the intervention on distal spoken language outcomes. The proposed study will
enroll 40 young adults with IDD. Individuals in both groups will be assessed: (a) at the start of the study, (b) at
the conclusion of intervention, and (c) six months following the conclusion of intervention. Individuals with IDD
in the WLIFT group will receive 3-months of intervention that: (a) utilizes functional texts—activities of daily
living that involve written language (e.g., text messages), (b) is specifically designed based on the phenotype
of commonly occurring IDDs and is delivered at a critical time as young adults transition to independence, (c)
involves teaching and assessing comprehension strategies implemented before, during, and after reading that
have been previously shown to be associated with stronger written and spoken language skills in struggling
readers, and (d) is implemented via telepractice to promote service delivery in meaningful contexts for the
individual with IDD. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to apply, adapt, and evaluate
written language strategies found to be effective in other populations of struggling readers, thereby advancing
the field of language development in individuals with IDD, where there is a striking paucity of communication
intervention research. This initial pilot study will demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects
necessary to support a full-scale clinical trial in a future R01 application."
10889529,"Pediatric nonadherence to medication is a significant public health problem, and rigorous research repeatedly
documents that nonadherence increases risk for hospitalization, healthcare cost, disease progression, and
death. Participants in our previous studies have described medication adherence as “one of the most stressful
parts” of pediatric cancer caregiving, and we found that 93% of parents experience barrier(s) to medication
administration. We have designed MedSupport, a theory-based multilevel intervention that is designed to
address root barriers to medication adherence. In Aim 1 we will determine if the MedSupport intervention
increases the proportion of patients with chemotherapy adherence 95% or higher. Our study design leverages
a unique opportunity as a companion study for an upcoming therapeutic trial and will enroll at 8 pediatric
cancer programs. This will enhance methodological rigor through leveraging robust clinical trial infrastructure to
achieve multi-site recruitment in diverse geographic and clinical sites. We will recruit families of pediatric
patients with ALL (N = 150) on home-based chemotherapy. Families will be randomized 1:1 to (1) the
MedSupport intervention and (2) usual care with standardized education control. We will use both MEMS
electronic medication monitoring and innovative biomarkers of drug metabolites to measure adherence. In Aim
2 we will test a theory-based mechanism of intervention effectiveness. These results will increase conceptual
significance through rigorous examination of mechanisms of action of the MedSupport intervention to inform
future intervention optimization and translation. In Aim 3 we will use the Implementation Outcomes Framework
to examine implementation effectiveness to enhance future dissemination of the MedSupport intervention. We
will examine the relationship between implementation quality on intervention effectiveness (Aim 3a) and
strategies that may hinder or support uptake within routine care to inform future implementation strategies (Aim
3b). Our design incorporates numerous elements that substantially increase rigor and reproducibility including
leveraging a large therapeutic trial for multi-site participant recruitment and rigorous measurement of
adherence through objective behavioral measures (electronic medication monitoring) and pharmacological
measures (validated biomarkers of drug metabolites). Findings will make significant conceptual contributions
through examining how the MedSupport intervention works to pave the way for future intervention optimization.
Findings will have significant translational impact through examining implementation effectiveness to enhance
future dissemination of the MedSupport intervention. Upon completion of this research, we will have an
innovative, low-cost, and scalable intervention to enhance home-based medication adherence in pediatric
cancer that is ready to be translated to clinical practice. While this study focuses on pediatric ALL, the
MedSupport intervention has potential for high impact in numerous pediatric diseases."
10889530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Recent data suggest that a substantial fraction of the HIV reservoir persisting in the face of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) is transcriptionally active and may contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in people with
HIV (PWH). This is particularly pertinent in elderly PWH, who exhibit additional elevated inflammation and co-
morbidities due to the aging process itself. Surprisingly, immune differences between the sexes prove largest
after the age of 65, an unexpected observation given that the menopausal transition in women (typically occurring
between the ages of 45-55) decreases estradiol to levels similar to those of men. The extent to which biological
sex and sex steroids impact the HIV reservoir and chronic inflammation in elderly PWH has not been sufficiently
studied. In this proposal, we will deeply characterize the transcriptionally-active HIV reservoir in aged ART-
suppressed men and women with HIV, determine how these cells contribute to chronic inflammation, and identify
novel ways to block their ongoing viral gene expression. We will leverage the infrastructure of the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), and include not only virally suppressed men and women with HIV, but also
those with non-suppressible viremia (NSV) as extreme cases of HIV transcriptional activity in the face of ART.
In Aim 1, we will use our newly developed single-cell sequencing-based technology, HIV-Seq, to compare the
phenotypes, transcriptomes, and clonal expansion history of transcriptionally-active reservoir cells between
elderly male and female participants, and between different tissue sites from aging women with HIV. In Aim 2,
we will use multiple “omics” technologies (CyTOF, Olink) to test the hypothesis that ongoing HIV gene expression
drives chronic inflammation by fueling expansion of HIV- and CMV-specific CD4+ T cells harboring
transcriptionally-active HIV. In Aim 3, we will identify novel ways to block ongoing HIV gene expression by
targeting the accessory protein Tat, and test the consequences of this blockade in primary cell models and using
patient specimens. Collectively, our aims will help develop strategies to prevent the expansion of the
transcriptionally-active reservoir in aging male and female individuals living with HIV and identify drugs that
durably silence HIV expression in reservoir cells. Our inclusion of post-menopausal women is a notable
innovation, as women have been historically understudied even though they shoulder a large burden of the HIV
epidemic."
10892277,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer (“survivors”) face high risks for early mortality and treatment-
related late effects, including subsequent breast cancer. Approximately 30% of female survivors previously
treated with chest radiation will develop breast cancer before age 50, a risk similar to BRCA1 mutation carriers.
The Children’s Oncology Group recommends early screening for breast cancer (in those who received
radiation) starting at age 25, but <15% of survivors are adherent, many because of economic barriers. Risk-
reducing medications, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, could allow
some survivors to avoid breast cancer entirely (vs. early detection with screening and treatment) since these
drugs reduce the risk of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors by 50% and are recommended for high-risk
women by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. However, risk-reducing medications are not currently
standard care for high-risk survivors which includes not only those previously treated with radiation but given
emerging data, those who were exposed to high doses of anthracycline chemotherapy. The rarity of childhood
and adolescent cancer and the long latency needed to capture subsequent cancers limit the feasibility of
prospective prevention trials. Addressing all RFA-CA-20-027 priority areas, we propose to use simulation
modeling and longitudinal observational data to inform clinical care by evaluating the clinical benefits and
harms of risk-reducing medications among childhood and adolescent cancer survivors. We will build on our
established collaboration with the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET), the
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study to: (1) refine two CISNET
models to reflect current knowledge on breast cancer risk, screening and prevention among survivors; (2)
provide model results in readily accessible online look-up tables summarizing benefits (e.g., avoiding breast
cancer), harms (e.g., medication side effects) and costs to women and society of adding risk-reducing
medication use for 5 years to screening; and (3) conduct exploratory analyses to assess the impact of risk-
reducing medications and screening on outcomes by race. Our proposed research will have high potential to
reshape current paradigms for survivorship care, using breast cancer risk-reducing medications as an example
for understanding how preventive agents can be incorporated into current survivorship recommendations and
practice. This work will also provide a framework to illuminate key elements and intervention points that can
guide efforts to minimize disparities. This project is conceptually innovative and clinically important by
simultaneously considering proven effective primary cancer prevention medicines together with screening
recommendations. This work will be highly translational by providing data to inform clinical care guidelines and
create resources that survivors and care-providers can use to guide care discussions on breast cancer
prevention and early detection."
10890398,"Development of Biotherapeutic Nanogels for Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment.
PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT):
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has affected about 44 million people worldwide.
Available treatments temporarily improve the associated symptoms, such as memory loss and difficulty in
thinking and reasoning. Even with the recent approvals of Aduhelm and Leqembi targeting Aβ which may benefit
only a subset of patients, novel interventions based on multiple other mechanisms are still needed due to the
heterogeneous nature of AD. Most importantly, AD is characterized by β amyloid (Aβ) deposition, directly linked
to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The need is to develop therapies that target the identified biomarkers
of AD, which can stop or significantly delay the progression of the disease. This proposal utilizes the patented
state-of-the-art autofluorescent biopolymeric nanogels (US Patent 10, 344,100; 2019; WO/2020/247730) with
inherent anti-viral properties, biodegradability, and cellular biocompatibility. These nanogels have demonstrated
salient features of biocompatibility, anti-viral, stability, and cellular uptake by microglial cells and also can
transmigrate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The preliminary molecular dynamics simulations studies of
the polyol-Aβ complex obtained by docking polyol to Aβ fibril showed that polyol binds to the interface where Aβ
peptides stack, potentially inhibiting the Aβ formation. Given these findings, we hypothesize that the increased
content of polyol and decreased polydispersity index of the nanogels will significantly increase the transport of
nanogels across the BBB. The linseed polyol will play a significant role in inhibiting the growth of β amyloid (Aβ)
aggregates, and the nanogels will be used to target the identified biomarkers of AD-like amyloid β, neurofibrillary
tangles as well as inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), NLRP3 and NF-kB levels in
the brain. To this end, In Specific Aim 1 we will improve our developed biotherapeutic nanogel for enhanced
transmigration across the BBB and study the efficacy of the developed nanogel to ameliorate the oxidative stress
in Alzheimer's disease. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the in vivo efficacy of the developed nanogel on amyloid
and tau pathology as well as neuroinflammation, dendritic spines, and learning skills in a 3xTg mouse model of
AD.
Altogether, we propose to develop a novel nanogel system with enhanced transmigration across the BBB with
more effective biotherapeutic efficacy to ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation associated with AD,
which is a very important unmet clinical need, and it is an area of high priority in AD/ADRD and is within the
mission of NIA. The above system will act as a multifunctional nanogel system inhibiting Aβ aggregate, and fibril
formation thereby rescuing from neuroinflammation, loss of dendritic spines, and cognitive decline in AD."

postdoctoral mentoring, integration into the Bay Area Aging Meeting (BAAM), and inclusion of a grant-writing
course in the curriculum. Each trainee appointment will be for a maximum of two years, but for extraordinary
cases may be extended to three years.
 Receiving broad institutional support, TPAR was immediately integrated into the established infrastructure
of trainee education at Stanford University. TPAR has benefitted and will continue to benefit immensely from
the continuing efforts and success of Stanford University programs to recruit and retain applicants from diverse
background.
 The population of the country is aging, with a much higher percentage of individuals over 70 years of age
than ever before and with an increasing percentage affected by devastating diseases of aging such as heart
disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. The emphasis of TPAR will be to provide broad,
interdisciplinary training, to coordinate aging research and training activities across the entire campus, and to
help disseminate basic and translational aging research by preparing trainees for the next steps in their
careers. In doing so, we expect that TPAR will serve not only the individual trainees but also the field of aging
research in general and society at large."
10891278,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy and is two to four times as common as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Because the
mechanisms responsible for SUDEP have not been clearly defined, there are no specific treatments to prevent
it. Observations from human and animal studies indicate that seizure-induced respiratory arrest typically
precedes asystole, and that many patients experience varying degrees of respiratory depression, autonomic
dysfunction, and impaired arousal following seizures. There is a fundamental gap in understanding how
seizures do this, and why only a small fraction of seizures lead to death. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons are central
CO2 chemoreceptors (CCR) that regulate breathing, autonomic function, and arousal. Patients with low
interictal CCR are more hypercapnic following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), and seizures may
depress CCR, an effect that can be measured with the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) test.
Impairment of CCR by seizures may contribute to autonomic dysfunction and impaired arousal after GTCS,
increasing the risk of SUDEP. The long-term goal is to develop new treatments to prevent SUDEP by
elucidating the mechanisms responsible for seizure-induced respiratory depression, autonomic dysfunction,
and impaired arousal. This knowledge will also lead to novel biomarkers to identify patients at highest risk. The
objective here is to characterize the relationship between seizure-induced blunting of CCR and postictal
respiratory depression, autonomic dysfunction, and impaired arousal. The central hypothesis is that seizures
inhibit 5-HT neurons in a subset of patients, and this leads to impairment of the ability to detect hypercapnia
and to initiate respiratory, autonomic and arousal responses to restore blood gas homeostasis. This hypothesis
has been formulated based on human and animal data from the applicants’ own laboratories and will be tested
with the following Specific Aims. (1) Characterize the role of CCR in postictal respiratory control and the acute
effect of seizures on CCR. (2) Determine how CO2 affects interictal autonomic function and how this is altered
by seizures. (3) Determine whether seizures impair the ability of CO2 to hasten recovery of consciousness in
the postictal state. Patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for video EEG study will undergo HCVR
testing during the interictal period and several times after seizures to determine the time course of impaired
CCR and its effect on cardiorespiratory and autonomic function. We will also measure the effect of CO2 on
arousal from sleep and on recovery of consciousness after GTCS, and relate these measures to CCR. This
approach is innovative because it is the first to directly examine how inhibition of serotonin neuron function by
seizures affects the respiratory, autonomic, and arousal response to CO2. The proposed research is significant
because identifying these mechanisms may lead to novel treatments to prevent SUDEP."

The two major oral diseases of mankind are chronic infections that result in dental caries and periodontitis. There
is evidence of specific dynamics of alterations in commensal and pathogenic bacteria related to periodontitis
within the normal population that appears to differ with aging and in diabetes. It is unclear, however, how HIV-1
infection and current management with antiretroviral drugs may affect the microbiome and disease. It is also
unclear how differences in this oral microbial ecology and systemic viral environment together with host
responses contribute to the destruction of the periodontium. Since characteristics of the immune system
repertoire are critical for maintaining general health, congenital or acquired disruptors of development of normal
immune functions are reflected in altered microbiota across body niches within the population. While extensive
literature has been acquired over the last 3+ decades on the features of the oral microbial biofilms in health and
periodontitis, these have primarily been reported from cross-sectional studies in adults with chronic periodontitis.
The interaction of a microbial dybiosis and dysregulated response in periodontitis coincident with HIV-1 infection
and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains unknown. This proposal engages a multi-disciplinary and
multi-institutional collaborative approach for the determination of the interaction of the chronic oral infection and
inflammatory disease, periodontitis, with the course and characteristics of SIV infections and response to ART.
The study will use a nonhuman primate model of ligature-induced periodontitis, which is a well-established model
of oral infection, inflammation, and mucosal disease, in Macaca mulatta. The experimental design will address
specific knowledge gaps about the interaction of the chronic infection and dysregulated immune responses of
periodontitis with the immunological and biologic changes occurring with SIV infection, including: (i) Periodontitis
effects on the viremia and CD4+ levels from SIV infection; (ii) SIV effects on the oral microbiome and salivary
and serum responses; and (iii) Interaction of periodontitis on ART efficacy. Our over-arching hypothesis is
that “Periodontitis and age will synergize to negatively impact parameters of SIV infection and will deleteriously
affect the efficacy of ART in managing the SIV infection.” Our proposed studies will be examined in three Specific
Aims: Specific Aim 1: To delineate age effects on the oral microbiome and targeted salivary biomarkers in
health, changes that occur with experimental periodontitis, and impact of a subsequent SIV infection. Specific
Aim 2: To delineate the effect of experimental periodontitis and age on the efficacy of ART treatment for an SIV
infection. Specific Aim 3: To delineate the effect of severe periodontitis on the efficacy of existing ART
treatment to control an SIV infection."
10892167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSP) are heritable neurodegenerative diseases in which progressive
degeneration of corticospinal axonal tracts results in limb weakness, spasticity and gait deficiencies. These
symptoms result from a dying back pattern of degeneration of corticospinal axons, which also display prominent
swellings of unclear pathological significance. The commonest form of HSP, termed SPG4-HSP, is caused by
mutations in the SPAST gene, which codes for a microtubule-severing protein called spastin. To date, the
prevailing mechanistic hypothesis for the etiology of SPG4-HSP is haploinsufficiency, meaning that the
corticospinal tracts degenerate because of insufficient functional spastin. However, several major disease
features are not readily explained by this etiology, and it is not clear how reduced microtubule severing would
promote corticospinal axonal degeneration. Providing novel information that may fill a major gap in our
knowledge of SPG4-HSP pathogenesis, recent work of the Principal Investigators revealed toxic properties of
mutant spastin proteins, suggesting that a gain-of-function mechanism operates in SPG4-HSP. Curiously, both
mechanisms negatively affect fast axonal transport (FAT), a cellular process fueled by molecular motor proteins
that allows bidirectional movement of vesicular cargoes along axons. Based on a strong experimental premise,
it is hypothesized in this multi-PI grant proposal that abnormalities in microtubule organization associated with
reduced spastin levels cause FAT deficits and axonal swellings (loss-of-function). On the other hand, toxic effects
of mutant spastin protein cause different FAT deficits that are mediated by casein kinase 2 (CK2), and these
deficits promote corticospinal axon degeneration (gain-of-function). The former makes the axon more vulnerable,
but it is the latter that suffices for corticospinal axon degeneration. The proposed work seeks to test these
hypotheses by directly comparing a mouse model with a single SPAST allele (SPAST +/-) with a transgenic mouse
model with both endogenous mouse SPAST alleles intact that additionally expresses human spastin bearing a
pathogenic mutation associated with SPG4-HSP (spastin-C448Y mice). In Aim 1, these models will be
individually crossed with mice that selectively express eGFP in corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), so that
loss-of and gain-of-function contributions to the disease can be investigated. In Aim 2, FAT deficits will be studied
in neurons cultured from these animals, and specific hypotheses for the etiology of the deficits will be tested. In
Aim 3, studies are proposed using transgenic spastin-C448Y mice in which autophagy is experimentally
enhanced or CK2 levels are experimentally reduced, to test the hypothesis that these manipulations will prevent
or reduce corticospinal axon degeneration and associated behavioral deficits. The overall significance of this
project is to establish mechanisms underlying SPG4-HSP and forge a path toward effective therapies for
patients."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic
disorders of the GI tract with rapidly increasing prevalence. Despite recent advances in treatment, a significant
proportion of patients have suboptimal responses to medical therapy, leaving an urgent need to identify new
therapies. One promising new approach to treat IBD is through the manipulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Tregs are an immune modulating subset of CD4+ lymphocytes that antagonize the activation and effector function
of multiple immune cell types and promote tolerance to self-antigens. Adoptively transferred Tregs are effective
in murine models of IBD. An alternative approach to disease management through Treg manipulation is to
increase Treg numbers in vivo. Interleukin-2 (IL-2, Proleukin®) is a T cell growth factor. IL-2 is currently licensed
for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma. At low doses, IL-2 promotes the
selective activation and expansion of Tregs in humans. Tregs constitutively express CD25, a component of the
high-affinity IL-2R, while CD25 is only transiently expressed by activated conventional T effector cells. Low-dose
(LD) IL-2 selectively expands Tregs in humans and is safe in chronic GvHD and other phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials. We recently published that LD IL-2 is protective in a humanized mouse model of IBD. Based on this
preclinical data, we initiated and have almost completed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of LD IL-2 in 24 patients with
UC. Subcutaneous (sc) LD IL-2 is well tolerated and associated with a biological response and pTreg expansion
in UC: overall, 41.6% of patients have achieved either response or remission including 60% of patients treated
with the maximum effective dose (MED). With this exciting data, we have developed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial
to assess the safety and the efficacy of LD SC IL-2 for the treatment of CD and to study the immunoregulatory
effects of IL2 in the peripheral and mucosal immune compartments. To date, we have obtained: 1) provisional
IRB approval; 2) an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the FDA; 3) support from commercial entities
to supply drug free of charge to patients. We have designed a comprehensive immunophenotyping strategy to
assess the biological effects of LD IL-2 and to correlate these findings with clinical outcomes. In this study we
propose: Aim 1: To determine the safety of sc LD IL-2 in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CD. We propose
a phase 1b/2a clinical trial of daily sc LD IL-2 for 8 weeks in CD patients to determine the maximum effective
dose (MED) and safety profile, and to assess a signal of efficacy. Aim 2: To determine in CD patients whether
sc LD IL-2 modulates peripheral blood and lamina propria Tregs in vivo and correlates with clinical outcome. We
will perform deep immunophenotyping in CD patients treated with LD IL-2 and comprehensively assess the
effects of LD IL-2 on CD4+ Tregs and other immune cells in both peripheral and mucosal compartments, and
correlate changes in immune phenotype with clinical outcome. Overall this trial is designed to determine the
MED and safety profile of LD IL-2 in CD, to obtain a signal of efficacy, and to assess mechanistic underpinnings."
10892198,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is an understudied subtype of breast cancer. Clinical and epidemiological
features of ILC are consistent with an exquisite dependence on estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha (ER),
and ILC biomarkers suggest that patients should have good outcomes with anti-estrogen treatment. However,
recent studies show that relative to other breast cancers, ILC patients have poorer long-term outcomes, have
poorer response to anti-estrogen therapy, and also do not benefit from chemotherapy. New treatments are
needed to improve ILC patient outcomes. However, advances are hindered by a fundamental lack of
understanding of the distinct biology of ILC, in particular regarding ER signaling. We and others identified de
novo anti-estrogen resistance in ILC models, and see that ER in ILC cells is activated by tamoxifen and next-
generation ER antagonists. Based on these observations, the limited efficacy of anti-estrogens in treating ILC
may be due to differences in ER function in ILC. Our work has identified unique ER functions in ILC, including
ILC-specific ER target genes, ER DNA binding, and ER signaling pathways, which in part explain endocrine
response and resistance. As a basis for these unique ER functions and anti-estrogen resistance in ILC, we
identified mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) as a novel transcriptional co-regulator of ER in ILC
cells. MDC1 is a cornerstone of DNA damage response, but in ILC, MDC1 acts as an ER co-regulator and is
required for ER-driven growth and ER regulation of key target genes, as well as anti-estrogen resistance. Our
data indicate that MDC1 regulates ER at least in part through epigenomic remodeling. MDC1 ER co-regulator
functions interplay with canonical roles of MDC1 in DNA damage response, implicating these functions in
clinical chemoresistance in ILC. The objective of this proposal is to define how MDC1 controls ER-driven gene
regulation and how ER:MDC1 mediates DDR functions in ILC cells. Our central hypothesis is that MDC1 is a
critical ER co-regulator mediating ER target gene regulation in ILC, creating targetable cross-talk between ER
and DNA damage response. In this study, we will: i) Define how ER and MDC1 interact to build a gene
regulation complex; ii) Define how ER and MDC1 influence their collective genome interactions; iii) Define the
DNA damage response that is associated with ER and MDC1 function. This project will lead to mechanistic
understanding of MDC1-driven ER functions in ILC, and link the unique functions of ER in ILC to new precision
treatment strategies using DDR inhibitors. Defining the role of MDC1 will also provide insight into the unique
ER-dependent etiology of ILC. This proposal will advance translational study of MDC1 by identifying ER:MDC1
biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to target MDC1-related DDR dependencies. Characterizing the role of
MDC1 is critical to understand ILC biology and improve outcomes for patients with ILC."

The complex events of gametogenesis and early embryonic development require tight regulation to ensure
proper reproduction and healthy offspring. To achieve this regulation while maintaining the plasticity necessary
for embryogenesis, germ cells rely heavily on RNA-level regulation of gene expression. RNA regulation plays a
number of important roles in germ cell development and maintenance, including maintenance of germ cell-
specific gene programs, protection of the germline genome from foreign or damaging sequences, and
translational repression and storage of maternal transcripts necessary for early embryonic development prior to
the onset of zygotic transcription. A diverse network of RNA binding proteins and small RNA pathways govern
this crucial RNA regulation, many of which have overlapping or redundant roles to ensure proper regulatory
fine-tuning. Adenosine DeAminases that act on RNA (ADARs), are RNA binding proteins that can influence the
cellular fate of transcripts either by binding to RNA or by catalyzing the deamination of Adenosine to Inosine,
known as A-to-I RNA editing. ADARs are present in all animals and have been shown to play important roles in
development, innate immunity, and oncogenesis. While the roles of ADARs in germ cells has not been
explored, my own preliminary data suggests ADARs are highly expressed in the germline and can influence
hundreds of germline transcripts. Additionally, previous work from other labs suggests that ADARs act along
with small RNA pathways to perform functions necessary for proper reproduction. As such, I hypothesize that
ADARs play a role in the extensive RNA regulation that takes place in the germline. My preliminary
experiments investigating the effects of ADARs on germline transcripts suggest that ADARs play a role on
regulating ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, I have found that many germline-edited transcripts are known
maternal transcripts, which are translationally repressed throughout the germline and stored for loading into the
embryo. For these reasons, I hypothesize that ADARs play a role in translational repression that occurs
throughout the germline during gametogenesis. To address this hypothesis, I will expand upon my
investigation of the effects of ADARs on germline transcripts as well as interactions with other germline RNA
regulators (Aim 1). I will assess the impact of ADARs on germline ribosome biogenesis and translational
activity (Aim 2). Finally, I will investigate the impact of ADAR editing on maternally loaded transcripts and early
embryonic RNA populations (Aim 3). Through these experiments, I will gain an understanding of the effects of
ADARs on germline transcripts, and a bigger-picture understanding of their role in germ cell development and
maintenance, early embryonic development, and reproduction in general. This work will contribute to our
understanding of the complex processes that facilitate successful and healthy reproduction."

A number of recent observations suggest that complex brain functions in the mammalian brain emerge from highly parallel computation in which information about sensory inputs, internal states, and behavioral parameters are mapped onto highly distributed brain-wide neuronal populations. This calls for neurotechnologies that allow for large-scale recording of neuro-activity across tissue depths and brain regions at physiological timescales and cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. While recent advancements in optical tool development based on the combination of two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy (2p M) and genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) as reporters of neuro-activity have been aimed at addressing these needs by developing faster, larger-scale, and volumetric calcium (Ca2+) imaging technologies, a fundamental unsolved challenge in this context is navigating the inherent tradeoffs between speed, resolution, and the size of the recording volume in a principled and scalable manner. Our lab has recently established criteria for such optimal recording schemes which has led to the realization of a new high-speed volumetric Ca2+ imaging approach termed Light Beads Microscopy (LBM). Through LBM, we have demonstrated fluorescence lifetime limited volumetric recording of neuro-activity at a single-cell resolution of up to 1 million neurons within both cortical hemispheres of awake, behaving mice. In this project, we will pursue a multipronged strategy towards the optimization, biological applications, and effective dissemination of our LBM technology while extending its performance. This will result in a more robust, less complex, and more user-friendly version of our LBM technology. To enable its broad and effective dissemination, in the second part of the project, we will utilize feedback from our α-testers to design, build, and disseminate β-prototypes of our system that will be distributed to several end-user laboratories who will be testing and applying our LBM technology in the context of their biological questions. This β-prototype will also form the basis for commercial dissemination of our technology as well as a parallel effort for its open-source dissemination."

 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in one of two genes,
PKD1 or PKD2, whereas it cannot be fully understood in terms of the constrained genetic setting, especially,
in families with the same genetic mutations but variable disease severity. Epigenetic regulation as a critical
driver of cell fate and survival can occur even in genetically identical humans, which may be an alternative
means of explaining PKD-associated alterations. Thus, the roles of epigenetic modulation of gene expression
and protein functions in ADPKD should become the focus of scientific investigation. However, in addition to
histone deacetylases (HDACs), the roles of DNA and histone methylation and the enzymes that mediate
these processes in ADPKD remain largely unexplored. PKD1 is hypermethylated in gene-body regions and
its expression is downregulated in ADPKD. By performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)
analysis, we have identified the genome-wide abnormal DNA methylation signatures in ADPKD kidneys
compared to those in normal kidneys, suggesting that DNA methylation is one of the key mechanisms
underlying cystogenesis. Within the five DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 is the only enzyme that functions
to maintain the DNA methylation patterns in human genome. DNMT1 was upregulated in Pkd1 mutant renal
epithelial cells and tissues, implying its role in the maintenance of the abnormal DNA methylation signatures
in ADPKD genome. We will investigate the roles and mechanisms of DNMT1 in regulating renal cyst
progression in aim 1. Since we identified an interaction between DNMT1 and Smyd2, one of the SET-
domain-containing histone (lysine) methyltransferases, it suggested that Smyd2 may be involved in DNMT1
mediated DNA methylation. We will investigate the crosstalk of DNMT1 and Smyd2 in the regulation of DNA
methylation and further delineate Smyd2-mediated molecular mechanisms in the regulation of cystogenesis
in aim 2, which may address if Smyd2 serves as a recruitment platform for DNMT1 on specific gene
methylation, thus highlighting a previously unrecognized direct connection between two key epigenetic
repression systems and providing a possible explanation of why the upregulation of DNMT1 in cancer and
PKD only targets specific genes but not all genes in patients’ genome. Furthermore, we will test if de-
methylation of hypermethylated DNA mediated by DNMT1 with Hydralazine and Smyd2 inhibitor delays cyst
growth in vivo in aim 3. This is the first study that not only links DNMT1 and DNA methylation to ADPKD but
also links the corresponding DNMT1 and Smyd2 signaling together in regulation of DNA methylation and
gene expression. In addition, this study will produce information that will be therapeutically relevant with
excelling potential for translation."

The lack of diversity (91.2% White) in the veterinarian-scientist workforce is a very serious concern and
impacts the profession’s ability to serve a society undergoing dramatic demographic shifts. Veterinary colleges
and professional organizations have put forth significant effort to recruit underrepresented students; however,
most efforts target high school students, a time when racial and ethnic disparities are already evident.
Meanwhile, young children are ruling out veterinary careers because of a lack of relatable role models. The
overall vision of this team is to establish a diverse veterinary workforce by developing a far-reaching, inclusive
veterinary STEM ecosystem consisting of US veterinary colleges (28/30 (93%) participating), veterinary work
settings (practice, research, industry, government), and community entities serving disadvantaged youth. By
working towards this critical vision, See Us-Be Us will be able to meet the goals of the 2014 NIH Physician-
Scientist Workforce Working Group and the 2018 Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and
Technology Council. As a step toward this vision, See Us-Be Us will provide a supportive role model network
and veterinary STEM educational resources to inspire and prepare underrepresented youth to pursue careers
in veterinary medicine. This goal will be attained through three specific aims. The focus of Aim 1 is to establish
an army of diverse, equity-minded veterinarians who will provide disadvantaged K-4 students direct,
supportive veterinary role models. Veterinary medical students will be certified to deliver STEM lessons to
children in communities surrounding veterinary colleges, while in school, and then after graduation, will be
equipped and supported to continue this effort in their home communities. Aim 2 is focused on developing
SuperPower Packs, self-guided veterinary STEM educational experiences that feature underrepresented
veterinarians, for disadvantaged children lacking access to direct supportive veterinary role models. Aim 3
develops a Web-based role model networking hub and podcasts, for middle and high school students to learn
about relatable veterinary professionals, find specific career information, and take advantage of experiential
and mentoring opportunities. Combined, these aims will enhance opportunities for students from underserved
communities, beginning in elementary school, to have authentic veterinary STEM experiences while being
supported by diverse veterinary role models, as they advance through the educational pipeline. Elementary
school teachers will serve as consultants to ensure that educational materials are consistent with Next
Generation Science Standards, and will assist in training role models to better communicate the societal impact
of their work. The ecosystem will continue to use the successful model of engaging students in STEM activities
by communicating the impact of veterinary medical research on public health and animal health challenges.
Ultimately, this project will educate and facilitate career exploration and experiential learning opportunities for
K-12 students, particularly those from underserved communities, to careers as veterinary scientists."
10867309,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Growing evidence suggests that dopamine contributes to key functions in multiple
RDoC domains, specifically Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive Systems, and Sensorimotor Systems. In
Late-Life Depression (LLD), dysfunction in all these systems is common, portends poor outcomes, and
manifests as deficits in motivation and effort, executive dysfunction, and gait impairment. While studies of
dopamine function in early and midlife depression primarily focus on reward processing, they often exclude the
cognitive and sensorimotor domains relevant for older adults despite a recognized decline in dopamine
function with normal aging. The objectives of this collaborative R01 proposal between Columbia
University/New York State Psychiatric Institute and Vanderbilt University Medical Center are to: 1) characterize
dopaminergic dysfunction in LLD across multiple RDoC domains (Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive
Systems, and Sensorimotor Systems) at several levels of analysis (cellular [PET], circuit [MRI], and behavioral
/ self-report); and 2) examine the responsivity of dopamine-related circuits and behavior to stimulation with
levodopa (L-DOPA). Supported by pilot data, this project builds on our past work demonstrating that
dopamine function declines with aging, that dopaminergic dysfunction contributes to deficits in behavioral
measures of the Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive Systems, and Sensorimotor Systems, and that L-DOPA
administration improves performance in these systems. The long-term goal of this line of research is to
determine how dopaminergic dysfunction contributes to clinical presentations of LLD, how responsive
behavioral symptoms are to modulation of dopamine function, and to identify novel targets for future
interventions. Our approach is to enroll 60 psychiatrically healthy elders (30 per site) and 120 depressed
elders (60 per site) exhibiting likely dopaminergic dysfunction, characterized as either slowed processing
speed or slowed gait speed. Participants will undergo thorough clinical characterization and complete PET
imaging measuring dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor availability, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI
measurement of long-term nigrostriatal dopamine transmission, task positive MRI focused on effort-based
decision making and reward processing, a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, a physical performance
evaluation, and measurement of inflammatory markers. To assess responsivity of the dopamine system to
modulation, depressed subjects then will be randomized to L-DOPA or placebo for 3 weeks, followed by repeat
multimodal MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessments. Using a cross-over design, participants will receive the
opposite intervention for an additional 3 weeks followed by clinical and cognitive assessments only. This
proposal is significant and innovative, as no prior published study has comprehensively examined
dopamine-dependent behaviors in LLD. This will inform treatment approaches focusing on facilitating cognition
and movement, reducing the effort cost of voluntary behavior, and promoting behavioral activation."

Antibodies specific for pathogenic threats can provide immediate protection from infectious disease but
longevity of an antibody responses after vaccination or infection can be highly variable. Responses induced by
some live vaccines can persist for a lifetime, whereas protein-based vaccines are in general shorter lasting.
However, antibody durability is not necessarily linked to the use of live virus as long-lived antibody responses
have been shown to be induced by the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, a non-live viral-like particle-
based platform. This suggests that distinct immunological cues can be engineered to result in the generation of
longer-lived antibody responses. While memory lymphocytes also provide a system of protective efficacy,
strategies to maximize robust levels of protective secreted antibodies that are stable over time is an important
goal in modern immunology. Understanding the capabilities of the immune system in this context, and how
available vaccines can elicit durable secreted antibody responses will be important to decipher. This is relevant
to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and for vaccine strategies more broadly. Preliminary data suggest that
antibodies induced by natural infection harbor robust long-term stability at modest levels and greater polyclonal
neutralizing breadth across viral variants compared to infection-naïve vaccinees. In addition, differential
antibody durability trajectories tend to favor COVID-19 convalescent subjects with dual memory B cell features
of greater antibody somatic mutation and cross-coronavirus reactivity. These findings support a hypothesis that
high somatical mutation and cross-reactivity in antigen-binding memory B cell repertoires early after recovery
predicts antibody durability and that recalled immunity may confer greater longevity of differentiated plasma
cells. This hypothesis will be examined in two aims, (i) to illuminate factors influencing anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody durability, and (ii) to chart the functional evolution of anti-CoV memory B cell over time. For aim 1,
human and mouse studies will be used to illuminate potential mechanistic insights and features connected to
durable antibody responses. For aim 2, the durability and evolution of memory B cell repertoire antigen
recognition capacity will be charted over time to assess the evolving relationship between secreted polyclonal
and memory B cell repertoires. This work is expected to shed light on factors that influence longevity and
evolution of antibody responses, which will be important for ongoing improvement of vaccine strategies."

EPIPROTEOME OF SEZARY SYNDROME
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are poorly understood and
many subtypes exhibit aggressive clinical course and high mortality with short (2-year) life expectancy after
diagnosis. Poor understanding of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CTCLs contributes to
suboptimal diagnostic subcategorization and lack of targeted therapies. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary
syndrome (SS) are two major forms of CTCL. Clinical staging and outcome of MF and SS is dependent on
the quantity of neoplastic cells in the blood. While SS is an aggressive disease with poor overall survival
(42.3% at 5 years and is by definition diagnosed at late stage disease, there are many patients with low
tumor burden (Early-stage CTCL) who suffer from delay in diagnosis due to the subjective nature of the
diagnostic criteria. The mean diagnostic delay (measured as the time from emergence of skin lesions to the
diagnosis of SS) is long (4.2 year; median 2.8 years) with a significant variation (1 month to 32 years). The
suboptimal diagnostic accuracy and imprecision of disease detection necessitates the development
of qualitative and objective biomarkers of SS. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been
introduced as anti- cancer agents which achieve their therapeutic effect in part by inhibiting deacetylation of
histones. However, despite the fact that CTCLs including SS were the first diseases which received FDA
approval for treatment with HDACi, responses to the drugs in each patient are markedly variable. An unmet
clinical need is the absence of reliable biomarkers directly interrogating the histone PTMs that can predict
response to the drugs. We recently developed a novel mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategy for unbiased
identification of histone PTMs and demonstrated its applicability for the analysis of primary samples of SS.
Importantly, these epiproteomic profiling studies reveal distinctive histone PTM marks that distinguish SS
from CD4+ T-cells from healthy individuals. It is our central hypothesis that epiproteomic modifications
(the histone code) of SS can be utilized for the early diagnosis and as predictors of response to
HDACi. Accordingly, we propose to investigate the utility of MS-based epiproteomic profiling for the early
diagnosis of SS and for the prediction of response to HDACi. The overall impact of this proposal is the
establishment of novel epiproteomic biomarkers that will improve outcomes particularly in aggressive
CTCLs."
10867312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Centrosome amplification (CA) is highly prevalent in cancer and strongly associated with tumor progression
and worse prognosis in several different cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian and lung. Centrosome
amplified cells also demonstrate increased motility and invasiveness leading to metastasis. Moreover, CA is
associated with genetic aberrations, such as p53 mutation that are commonly observed in aggressive forms
of cancers, such as the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our long-term goal is to target the growth and
metastatic dissemination of aggressive breast tumors with CA that will ultimately lead to improved patient
outcome. The overall objectives of this project are to (i) inhibit tumor growth in breast cancer models with CA
via inducing centrosome de-clustering and formation of multipolar spindles upon targeting transforming acidic
coiled-coil 3 (TACC3), and to (ii) block local invasion and metastatic dissemination in CA models by
preventing cell polarization, migration and invasion upon inhibition of TACC3. The central hypothesis is that
TACC3 inhibition will, on one hand, prevent active clustering of amplified centrosomes into two spindle poles
during mitotic cell division leading to multipolar mitosis and apoptotic cell death in p53 altered cells, and on
the other hand disrupts centrosome and Golgi re-orientation, microtubule nucleation and cell polarization in
interphase cells leading to decreased migration. The rationale for this project is that TACC3 inhibition
represents a unique opportunity to eliminate the most aggressive tumors that have supernumerary
centrosomes, while sparing the normal cells. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursing two specific
aims: 1.) To inhibit tumor growth in aggressive breast cancer models with CA by targeting TACC3, and 2.)
To prevent metastasis in aggressive breast cancer models with CA by targeting TACC3. State-of-the-art
experimental settings with translatable approaches will be employed, including tumor organoids, patient-
derived xenografts and immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of advanced breast cancer that we
characterized in terms of CA. The research proposed in this project is innovative as it aims to study
mitosis/interphase-specific interactomes of TACC3 that are essential for TACC3-mediated cell division in
mitotic cells and cell polarity in interphase cells that we propose to block using our novel and highly potent
TACC3 inhibitor as well as using CRISPR-mediated knock-out. The proposed project is significant because
it is expected to provide key mechanistic and phenotypic pre-clinical data to support the notion that targeting
TACC3 concomitantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer models with CA, which will then
dramatically reduce mortality rates among patient subpopulation with highly aggressive cancers."

The cochlea is innervated by spiral ganglion neurons, which relay sound information from sensory hair cells to
central auditory targets. Deafness due to acoustic trauma is associated with pathologies in both spiral ganglion
neurons and the hair cells which they innervate, and an important aspect of repairing the deafened cochlea is
coaxing spiral ganglion neurons to re-innervate their hair cell partners. It is generally anticipated that hair cell re-
innervation will require the reactivation of developmental mechanisms. Therefore, understanding early
developmental events is an important prerequisite for regeneration-based therapeutic strategies.
A subset of spiral ganglion neurons has nociceptive characteristics and are thus equipped to detect acoustic
trauma, which may be important for preserving function. These are the type II spiral ganglion neurons, which
constitute a minority of cochlear afferents but innervate all outer hair cells. The development of type II neurons
is unique and facilitates outer hair cell innervation because their peripheral axons project beyond the inner hair
cells. An important component of cochlear innervation is how the type II spiral ganglion neurons subsequently
make a distinct 90° turn towards the cochlear base to synapse with multiple outer hair cells. While many aspects
of outer hair cell innervation are unknown, our laboratories have found that two signaling pathways, planar cell
polarity (PCP) signaling and Eph/Ephrin signaling, are required for the 90° turn that directs the peripheral axon
towards the cochlear base. A similar phenotype occurs with loss of the transcription factor Prox1 suggesting that
a regulatory hierarchy controls cochlear innervation.
The goal of this research is to establish the relationship between these two signaling pathways by examining
each in detail and relative to each other. This includes experiments in Aim 1 to distinguish between alternative
mechanisms in which PCP proteins pattern the organ of Corti prior to innervation or signal directly to the growth
cone. Since the Ephrin receptor EphA7 is also required for axon turning, in Aim 2 we will determine if these
pathways are linearly organized or if they are parallel and redundant signals with each promoting turning.
Remarkably the EphA7 promoter contains putative Prox1 binding sites suggesting that these guidance
mechanisms may be transcriptionally regulated. This hypothesis will be tested further in Aim 3. While these
experiments are focused on developmental processes, we anticipate that these are events which must be
reenacted during hair cell re-innervation and repair, and therefore the proposed research will advance therapies
for repairing the deafened cochlea."

Metabolic syndrome (MS), characterized by a cluster of conditions including dyslipidemia, central abdominal
obesity, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure, is prevalent in people living with HIV (PLWH), and puts
them at greater risk of cardiovascular events. MS and related metabolic derangements have been strongly
correlated with gut microbiome activity outside the context of HIV but has not been deeply explored in HIV
infected or uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM), who have a highly altered gut microbiome
composition. Intestinal dysbiosis, compromised intestinal barrier integrity and associated inflammation has
been linked with MS in certain populations, but whether this is a driving factor of high levels of MS in HIV+
MSM has not been deeply explored, even though increased bacterial translocation and associated systemic
inflammation is known to occur in PLWH. In our ongoing studies of factors that influence metabolic disease
across HIV+ and HIV negative MSM, we found elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) to be
the most important predictor of poor metabolic health, with network analysis showing that LBP formed a hub
joining correlated microbial and immune predictors of poor metabolic health. Our results suggest a central role
of inflammatory processes linked with barrier dysfunction in the development of MS in HIV+ MSM, but further
mechanistic studies are needed to fully understand how barrier function is compromised, including a potential
role for gut bacteria and bacterial-derived metabolites, which are well known to influence barrier. One key
finding of our ongoing work was a negative correlation between plasma LBP levels and butyrate-producing
bacteria; Butyrate has a well-characterized protective influence on intestinal epithelial integrity. We also
observed a positive correlation between LBP and a microbe that degrades sialic acids on mucus glycoproteins,
which has also been linked with intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammatory processes in PLWH previously.
Thus, we hypothesize that intestinal dysbiosis impacts gut barrier function in HIV+ MSM, and that this
promotes MS via the translocation of microbial products including LPS. To test this hypothesis, we will
perform three coordinated specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine whether intestinal barrier dysfunction is
higher in HIV+ and negative MSM with MS compared to without MS and related to deficiency in butyrate-
production and/or activity of mucolytic bacteria in the gut microbiome. In Aims 2 and 3 we will verify the
relationship between HIV/MS-associated gut microbes and barrier dysfunction using enteroides and
gnotobiotic mice, and explore the role of microbial production of butyrate and degradation of mucus
glycoproteins in these processes. Taken together this work will produce a mechanistic understanding of the
relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis, barrier function, and MS in HIV-infected individuals and will
have broader implications as well, since intestinal barrier dysfunction has been linked with chronic
inflammation, and many associated co-morbidities in PLWH."

Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plays essential roles in neuronal survival, differentiation, and
plasticity, and it contributes to learning and memory. The expression of BDNF is highly induced by neuronal
activity, allowing it to function in temporal coordination with the reception of sensory stimuli. Proper control of
Bdnf expression is essential to its function, because expressing too little or too much BDNF at the wrong times
or in the wrong places has been shown to impair brain development, plasticity, and function. Neuronal activity-
dependent induction of BDNF expression is mediated primarily at the transcriptional level, via the regulation of
stimulus-modulated transcription factors. Although prior studies sought evidence for mechanisms of Bdnf
regulation at this gene’s promoters, recent evidence shows increased long-range chromatin interactions with
Bdnf upon neuronal activation, which suggests the potential importance of transcriptional regulation at distal
activity-regulated enhancers. Using previously published ChIP-seq datasets and the chromatin conformation
data from these recent studies, I have identified six putative distal enhancer regions. Given the function of
enhancers in conferring specificity upon the regulation of gene transcription, I hypothesize that these enhancers
contribute to the stimulus-specific control of Bdnf transcription. In Aim 1, I will test the function and neuronal
activity-dependent regulation of these distal enhancers in mouse cortical neurons both using reporter assays
and in their endogenous chromatin context by activating or repressing the enhancers with dCas9-fusion proteins.
In Aim 2, I will focus on an intragenic enhancer of BDNF to test the hypothesis that the binding of the transcription
factor NPAS4 to this enhancer mediates a cell-type specific mechanism of regulation in the hippocampus in the
context of fear in vivo. This aim will take advantage of transgenic dCas9/CRISPR mice that I will use for enhancer
regulation in the context of neural circuits in vivo. Completion of these two aims will elucidate the specificity
provided by enhancers in Bdnf regulation. This proposal will also highlight the significance of transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms in coupling upstream stimuli to its appropriate downstream response."
10867518,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) continue to have poor prognosis, largely because
of disease recurrence and/or the development of metastatic disease. New therapies are an unmet need for
patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. Immune-based therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs), have been introduced and Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, is currently approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. Use of ICIs is based on the premise that rejuvenation of suppressed anti-tumor
immunity in cancer patients will improve outcome. Unfortunately, only a minority of the HNSCC patients treated
with ICIs responds to the immunotherapy (IT), possibly due to the unresponsiveness of immune cells to activation
in profoundly immunosuppressed HNSCC patients. Exosomes have emerged as major contributors to tumor-
associated immune suppression and a significant barrier to antibody-based and adoptive cell-based therapies
in cancer. We have reported that IT is not effective in cancer patients with high levels of circulating exosomes,
and have also shown that circulating exosomes carrying immunosuppressive ligands, such as PD-L1, impair
functions of immune effector cells in HNSCC patients and negatively impact disease progression. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the removal of immunosuppressive exosomes from the circulation of HNSCC patients prior to
IT will promote immune cell recovery and significantly increase the response rate. To test this hypothesis and
develop novel therapeutic capabilities for cancer patients, we have established a partnership between Aethlon
Medical, Inc. and three academic institutions. Aethlon Medical, Inc. has developed the Hemopurifier®, a good
manufacturing practices (GMP)-compatible device for removal of blood-borne viruses and exosomes and
designed for use with standard dialysis machines. In Aim 1, we will characterize exosomes removed from
HNSCC patients’ plasma by the research-grade version of the Hemopurifier. We will correlate the
immunosuppressive profiles, functions and miRNA content of these exosomes with clinicopathological endpoints
and disease activity. In addition, using a mouse model, we will demonstrate that depletion of exosomes restores
anti-tumor immunity and inhibits tumor growth, while delivery of suppressive exosomes promotes tumor growth
and carcinogenesis. In Aim 2, we will conduct a single-arm Phase II clinical trial using a clinical-grade
Hemopurifier to establish that removal of exosomes from the circulation of patients with recurrent/metastatic
HNSCC improves responses to IT. Finally, in Aim 3, we will utilize data and samples from the Phase II clinical
trial to identify predictors of benefit from exosome depletion by Hemopurifier prior to IT. Successful completion
of the proposed project is expected to result in novel therapeutic capabilities and new predictive tools based on
plasma exosomes to improve clinical responses to ITs for patients with HNSCC."
10864229,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and inevitably recurrent brain tumor with a dismal prognosis and
highly heterogeneous profiles. While front-line chemoradiotherapy (CRT) improves survival, it also complicates
the assessment of early tumor progression (TP). Pseudoprogression (PsP), presenting as increased
enhancement indistinguishable from TP by conventional MRI, occurs in about 36% of GBM patients. The
current RANO criteria require longitudinal follow-up imaging exams and occasionally biopsy to make the
ultimate distinction, often 6 or more months after the completion of CRT, precluding the possibility of timely and
potentially more effective interventions. Despite advances in sophisticated physiological and metabolic MRI
techniques, response assessment remains a prevailing challenge in the clinical management of GBM.
Encouraged by recent findings in murine GBM xenografts that are corroborated further by a patient case, this
proposal aims to validate the underlying histopathological basis and assess the ability of MR elastography
(MRE) in the early differentiation of TP by spatially mapping the heterogenous response in GBM patients. MRE
is an MRI technique that provides noninvasive, quantitative, and direct 3D maps of tissue viscoelastic
properties in vivo. These biomechanical factors of tumors have been increasingly recognized to have profound
implications for malignant progression, tumor heterogeneity, and treatment resistance. The central hypothesis
of this project is that MRE can accurately differentiate between early TP and PsP by mapping the spatial
distribution of active tumor and treatment-related changes (TRCs) within the known heterogeneous tumor
response. Two independent specific aims are outlined to test this hypothesis. MRE features distinctive of active
tumors and TRCs will be validated in Aim 1 in a pre-operative cohort with gold-standard tissue confirmation.
The approach takes advantage of high-precision sampling during neuro-navigational surgeries to obtain co-
localized tissue and imaging volumes for quantitative correlation analysis. This much-needed but never studied
correlation in human GBM is crucial to help elucidate the pathophysiologic basis of the heterogenous MRE
contrast. The ability of viscoelastic imaging markers to differentiate early TP from PsP will be determined in a
longitudinal post-CRT imaging study in Aim 2. The approach leverages a robust high-sensitivity MRE
methodology developed by the study team originally for mapping rapid functional changes in human brains to
provide a high-resolution mapping of tissue viscoelastic properties. This enables full utilization of the diagnostic
features in the heterogeneous biomechanical response of tumors for more accurate distinction. This innovative
project will establish the first evidence on the role of MRE in the clinical evaluation of the treatment response of
GBM. It is significant as the accurate and early understanding of the true underlying tumor burden following
CRT is critical for guiding subsequent treatment planning to improve patient outcomes."

Biology at the nanoscale is driven by molecular recognition. Cells are lined with receptors that recognize a
myriad of biomolecules and transmit signals to the cell interior. This forms the basis of cell-cell communication
that allows multicellular organisms to thrive. An understanding of molecular recognition is tremendously
important for human health, as it underlies our immune system’s response to threats from viruses, bacteria and
cancer cells. Unfortunately, these recognition processes are often much more complicated than the canonical
“lock-and-key” paradigm. Many neuropeptides and peptide hormones are dozens of residues in length and can
exhibit tremendous structural plasticity. The study of molecular recognition in such dynamic systems is a
challenge, as only a limited understanding of the interactions can be gleaned from structural approaches alone.
 Computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulation allows us to view complex biomolecular systems in
atomic detail, allowing us to compute binding and unbinding rates, and to study their molecular determinants. A
well-known drawback of MD is the difficulty of exploring conformational landscapes without getting trapped in
local free energy minima. The PI (Dickson) has over a decade of experience developing new methods for
tackling this problem, which are able to calculate transition rates in complex systems. Particularly, the REVO
method (“Reweighting Ensembles by Variation Optimization”) has shown success on unbinding pathways of
drug-like ligands with mean first passage times up to 34 minutes, which is billions of times beyond the typical
reach of straightforward MD. This is done without applying biasing forces to the system or making any
assumptions about equilibrium conditions. REVO is essentially an evolutionary algorithm in trajectory space,
where a large group of trajectories are run in parallel, and outlier trajectories are identified using a
measurement of distance to other ensemble members. These outliers are “cloned”, which increases the
probability of seeing long-timescale events happen, even in short-time trajectories.
 The proposed work will augment this method with recent advances in the automatic detection of slow
collective variables (or “CVs”). The VAMPnet (“Variational Approach for Markov Processes”) approach will be
used to detect groups of CVs to use in the REVO distance calculation. A method for iteratively improving the
accuracy of rate calculations (“Asynchronous weighted ensemble”) is also proposed. Together these
developments will constitute a powerful tool for studying long-timescale events in complex biomolecular
systems that will be made freely available to other researchers. Through collaborations with experimental
partners, this method will be applied to reveal the molecular mechanisms of: i) peptide signaling for a class-B
GPCR (Aim 2), and ii) specific recognition of bacterial LPS by a phage tail-spike protein (Aim 3). These
mechanisms will inform the design of new molecules with potential therapeutic applications."

The Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO) proposes to collaborate with FDA/OTED
and national food safety training partners to establish a coordinated effort for expansion and
development of the Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS) National Curriculum Standard (NCS),
including continued development of human and animal food (including Retail Food,
Manufactured Food, Animal Food, Produce, Milk, Laboratory, and Shellfish) competency and
curriculum frameworks, further development and validation of human and animal food
competency statements and behavioral anchors, and updates to and development of human
and animal food training courses to meet the needs of state and local food regulatory agencies,
which is required for a successful, national IFSS. The end goal of this proposed project is to
significantly increase training opportunities for human and animal food regulatory agencies,
leading to long term improvements in the knowledge, skills, and abilities of regulators as part of
an IFSS.
AFDO will recruit human and animal food subject matter experts (SMEs) to create a pool of
qualified candidates who can assist in the development of curriculums, frameworks,
competencies, and courses. AFDO will also assist with the instructor qualification process for
course delivery and to assure that all SMEs who will deliver United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) human and animal food courses will first complete instructor skills training
(ISTs) and demonstrate their training capabilities through the satisfactory completion of course
specific instructor training (CSIT) or an audit assessment conducted during the pilot testing of
training courses or programs developed.
Achieving all project objectives will require extensive cooperation and coordination between
training partners. AFDO will build upon its existing broad network of resources, including its
community of federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal entities built over more than 120 years of
the association’s existence and experience. The outcomes of this project will be the
advancement of a national IFSS through the establishment of a well-coordinated NCS, an
increase in the number of quality human and animal food courses available to regulators, and
an increase in the number and quality of trained and vetted SME trainers."

This application is for a 5-year renewal of the T32 Training Program in the Development of Psychopathology:
From Brain and Behavior to Intervention. Because mental and substance abuse disorders are more likely to
arise early in life, early identification of risk processes and early intervention are crucial (Insel, 2014). As the field
has been shifting from a behavioral to a neurodevelopmental focus, this training program also has evolved to
reflect important advances in human brain development. The major thrust of this interdisciplinary program is to
produce scientists who will (1) contribute to the state of knowledge about neurobiological and psychosocial
mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of psychopathology, and (2) translate findings from
basic research to the construction of empirically-based interventions for the prevention and amelioration of
psychopathology and for the promotion of mental health. This training program provides individual mentoring in
multidisciplinary science complemented by didactic activities. A personalized training plan is developed for each
fellow and re-evaluated each semester. In the last five years, we have continued to increase training on
multidisciplinary research on neurobiological, psychophysiological, genetic, and psychosocial mechanisms
underlying psychiatric illness. To this end, we have made some changes to our core, training faculty. All 24
faculty are currently funded, with 75% as PIs on at least one grant, and the others serving as co-PIs or
investigators. Two-thirds of our current training faculty are actively involved in neuroscience research. Another
54% of our faculty conduct intervention studies aimed at reducing or preventing psychiatric problems including
depression, anxiety, and substance use. In the last decade, all of our 26 pre- and 10 post-doctoral trainees
have continued to contribute to the field through scholarly research, teaching, and administration. Three predocs
remain in training on this T32; 2 former trainees are working on their dissertations; 4 are doing their required
clinical internship. All 17 remaining former predoc trainees have completed their PhDs; 4 are engaged in research
intensive faculty positions in academic departments of psychology or medicine; 3 are doing research intensive
postdoctoral fellowships. The remaining 10 former predoc trainees are doing some research related work
including teaching, supervision, or administration. Of the 10 postdoctoral fellows, 2 are still in training; 6 of the 8
(75%) former postdocs are actively involved in research intensive faculty positions and all have received some
kind of external funding (e.g., K’s; R01, Foundations). In the past 10 years, 22% of all trainees were from under-
represented ethnic minority or economically disadvantaged groups; 83% are female. This renewal application
proposes to again support 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees annually. Goals for the next 5 years are to
continue to train independent research scientists who can discover and translate basic knowledge from clinical
neuroscience into interventions for reducing psychopathology."

The host microenvironment is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis, and a major determinant of
resistance to treatment and relapse. Expression of N-cadherin (Ncad), a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion
molecule, in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) has been reported to favor tumor growth. Ncad is the main
cadherin expressed in bone cells, where it functions in cell-cell adhesion, but also regulates signaling and
differentiation. In preliminary studies we found that, contrary to expectations, ablation of the Ncad gene (Cdh2)
in osteolineage cells – expressing the osteogenic marker, Osterix (Osx+) – does not affect bone engraftment
of breast cancer cells; however, subcutaneous tumors grow faster and lung metastases develop earlier than in
wild type littermates. We also find, unexpectedly, that Ncad is present in previously unrecognized Osx+ cells
in extra-skeletal tumors. These cells have a transcriptomic profile more similar to osteogenic cells than to CAF,
and favor tumor growth. Furthermore, Ncad in Osx+ cells down-regulates p38 responsive genes, a pro-
tumorigenic pathway. In human breast cancer, Osx+ are an index of poor prognosis. These preliminary results
demonstrate that Ncad in Osx+ cells is a negative regulator of cancer progression, an effect opposite to Ncad
reported action in CAF. We contend that Ncad exerts multiple and even opposite actions on tumorigenesis
depending on the cell context where it is expressed, via modulation of specific signaling pathways.
Based on these preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that Ncad in pro-tumorigenic Osx+ cells
restrains tumor growth by regulating signals that reprogram the tumor microenvironment. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 – Modulation of extra-skeletal tumor
growth by Ncad in Osx+ cells; testing the hypothesis that Ncad in Osx+ cells restrains tumor growth; loss of
Ncad in TAOC increases tumor growth and metastases in mice. Osx+ Ncad+ cells correlate with tumor
grading in human breast cancer. Specific Aim 2 – Mechanisms of Ncad modulation of pro-tumorigenic signals
in tumor-associate Osx+ cells; testing the hypothesis that Ncad in Osx+ cells is an upstream regulator of p38
and Pten signaling; loss of Ncad in Osx+ cells results in accentuated expression of p38-dependent pro-
tumorigenic factors and decreased Pten dependent signals, leading to tumor microenvironment modification
and enhanced tumorigenesis. We will use in vivo approaches, including diphtheria toxin-induced selective cell
ablation, parabiosis, lineage tracking, as well as non-biased transcriptomic approaches (single cell RNAseq) to
unlock the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Ncad in extraskeletal Osx+ cells affects tumor growth
and metastasis. We will also determine the clinical pathology correlates of Ncad expression in Osx+ cells in
human tumors. Results of the proposed studies will lay the foundations for the development of new markers of
tumor progression and/or new therapeutic strategies aimed at interrupting environmental support of cancer
growth and metastasis by targeting specific cells in the tumor stroma."

The broad objective of this study is to understand the mechanism by which multiple stem cell populations are
controlled by the niche to coordinate daughter cell production. Coordination between adult stem cells is
essential to maintain tissue homeostasis and prevent tumorous overgrowth. Many structures, including the hair
follicle, hematopoietic network and developing ovary require tight control over stem cell proliferation and
coordination of daughter cell production from distinct stem cell lineages. In most cases, the molecular
mechanisms orchestrating this coordination are largely unknown. Leveraging the power of Drosophila genetics
and establishing a system for longitudinal (20+ hours) live imaging of stem cells within an endogenous niche
we have begun to reveal the mechanisms controlling stem cell coordination in the testis. Somatic stem cells
and germline stem cells (GSCs) of the testis must generate daughters in a precise 2:1 ratio for germ cells to
effectively differentiate into sperm. Our live imaging has revealed a modified cytokinesis program in GSCs as
the mechanism to coordinate release of one GSC daughter only after it correctly associates with two daughters
of the somatic stem cell lineage. This modified cytokinesis program is controlled at two stages—a pause
regulated by Jak/STAT signaling from the niche and a trigger for completion of cytokinesis derived from the
somatic stem cells. Both control points must be properly executed or stem cell cytokinesis fails, stem cell
tumors form and germ cells fail to differentiate. While we have identified the source of both the pause and
trigger, the mechanisms by which these signals control GSC cytokinesis remain unknown. In addition, the
degree to which soma and germline communicate to ensure that proper ratios of daughter cells are produced
is largely unexplored. This study uses molecular genetics and extended live imaging to interrogate the specific
mechanisms by which niche signals and somatic stem cells combine to regulate GSC cytokinesis to ensure
coordination between stem cells in the testis niche. By establishing a method for live imaging of both stem cell
populations, we can now also directly visualize stem cell coordination in real time and interrogate the cross-talk
between stem cell lineages that is essential for tissue homeostasis. Successful completion of the proposed
work will provide significant insight into stem cell-niche interactions and how these may become disrupted
during tumorigenesis, setting the foundation for future work aimed at identifying similar mechanisms at play in
other tissues and species."

Excessive alcohol drinking Initiated during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental patterns,
increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood.
In response to RFA-AA-21-008, the Administrative Resource (AR) proposes to coordinate activities of the
National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for
the next 5 years a diverse community sample of male and female participants recruited in three age bands (12-
14, 15-17, 18-21 years old) as mostly no-to-low drinkers, tracked over the last 8 years across 5 sites (N=831;
93% retention rate). This consortium reflects seven applications: NCANDA - Administrative Resource (UCSD)
and NCANDA - Data Analysis Resource (SRI), and five cross-national Research Project Sites, located at Duke
University (Duke), Oregon Health Science University (OHSU), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), SRI International
(SRI), and UC San Diego (UCSD). Monitoring has involved annually multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting
state fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by
computer and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging
and sleep and physical activity tracking. Our accelerated longitudinal design uniquely positions NCANDA-A
(ages 18-34) to quantify transient or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in adolescent and early adult neural
system growth trajectories and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, we investigate
the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on subsequent
developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and psychopathology. Aim 2
identifies the extent to which alcohol’s effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance
of binge drinking. Aim 3 identifies adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors that forecast
excessive drinking during early adulthood. Aim 4 quantifies COVID-19 pandemic impact on alcohol use, stress,
and wellbeing. Aim 5 (SRI and Pittsburgh sites) identifies interactions among alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac
function. Aim 6 (UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites) determines the extent to which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol
use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect, sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal
of structural and functional brain effects of binge alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences will be tested.
With longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by discovering
elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."

 One of the new frontiers in structural enzymology is the expansion from a three-dimensional to a truly four-
dimensional approach by adding the time dimension to structural studies. While Synchrotron Radiation (SR)
crystallography and cryo Electron Microscopy allow the determination of structures in minute detail they are in
most cases performed on frozen static samples. With the advent of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) like the
Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford, and the development of the “probe before destroy” concept it
now is possible to follow structural changes in enzymes in real time and under close to physiological conditions
at room temperature (RT). Driven by the success of XFELs and recent advances in detector technology and
storage ring and beam line design, several SR sources are also starting to offer time resolved crystallography at
RT. These unprecedented capabilities will open new fields of research, not only in biomedical sciences but also
in many other areas. Due to the “probe before destroy approach” utilized here, the samples generally need to
be replaced after a single X-ray exposure. As biological samples of interest are often only available in scarce
amounts, it is mandatory to develop a robust method to introduce the sample into the X-ray interaction region in
a continuous manner that minimizes the required sample amount. In order to obtain true “molecular movies” of
enzymes of biomedical importance in action, which will contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of
these molecular machines, it is essential to synchronize the enzyme in the probed sample volume and initiate
the reaction of interest in a temporally well-defined manner. Methods for reaction initiation can include mixing
with a substrate/chemical compound, or utilize other stimuli such as light, temperature jump, or change in pH or
electrical potential. In the frame of this proposal, we will continue the development of robust and versatile sample
delivery and reaction triggering methods. We will also integrate multi-modal detection methods, combining X-ray
diffraction with complementary in situ spectroscopic techniques to probe both global structures and chemical
properties of enzymes concurrently. We will focus on the development of drop-on-demand methods based on
acoustic transducer technology, but also explore other droplet dispensing technologies and microfluidics to
substantially diminish/eliminate any sample wastage. We will improve the previously developed prototypes for
depositing the drops on a moving support, such as a tape or wheel, that can circulate and is self-cleaning, for
non-stop continuous operation at the XFEL or SR facility. Several methods for enzyme-substrate mixing will be
tested, with emphasis on liquid-gas and liquid-liquid mixing, including with micron size droplet collision methods
to achieve faster time resolution. Experiments on well-defined enzyme model systems will be accommodated by
modeling approaches to design chemical mixing experiments and use feedback from measurements to optimize
the design. These will be implemented at SR and XFEL beam lines and made available for the broader structural
enzymology user community."

properties, expanding the scope of imageable disease targets. However, subsequent development of clinically
applicable radiopharmaceuticals has been impeded by a significant gap in knowledge of aqueous coordination
chemistry of the corresponding metal ions. Scandium(III) aqueous chemistry represents a prime example of this
conundrum. 43Sc (Eβ+ avg = 476keV, t1/2= 3.9h) and 44Sc (Eβ+ avg = 632keV, t1/2= 4h) have ideal properties for
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging up to 24h post injection. For therapy applications, the emission
properties of 47Sc (Eβ− avg = 162keV, t1/2 = 80.4h) are comparable to 177Lu (Eβ− avg = 134keV, t1/2 = 159.6h). The
Sc(III) ion is a close chemical match to Lu(III) with respect to ionic radius and chemical hardness; therefore
43Sc/44Sc also represents an ideal diagnostic isotope partner to the already widely accessible 177Lu therapy
isotope, producing more directly predictive image-derived pharmacokinetics and dosimetry for radiotherapy.
However, the pronounced solution chemistry knowledge deficiency has hampered efficient separation, isolation,
and application of Sc(III) isotopes as clinical radiopharmaceuticals. To enable the synthesis of a broad range of
diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals based on Sc and Lu isotopes, we propose three aims towards
new chemical and in vivo validated strategies that enable high-yielding, high molar activity, low temperature
radiochemistry approaches to theranostic radiopharmaceuticals."

Early-life exposures, both prenatally and in early childhood, can lead to lasting consequences in the development
of health and disease throughout the life-course. Two major classes of ubiquitous chemicals detected almost
universally across human populations are metals and synthetic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
Metals and metalloids, such as lead and arsenic, are known hazardous substances and prenatal exposure has
been shown to modulate the developing immune system. Similarly, exposure to PFAS consistently has been
associated with decreased immune response to important childhood immunizations like the tetanus and
diphtheria vaccines. However, our understanding of the combined impact of these two classes of chemicals on
the developing immune system and immune response remains limited. While childhood immunization remains
a cornerstone for public health prevention our understanding on how early-life chemical exposures affect immune
system development and response remains extremely limited. Even more limited is our understanding of the
joint contribution of multiple chemical exposures in early life on the immune system. Current risk assessments
for these compounds are performed with adult endpoints and estimates of exposure to a single chemical. We
propose to comprehensively and systematically investigate the influence of prenatal and early-life exposure to a
mixture of metals and PFAS on the developing immune system and their influence on vaccine-induced immunity.
We are leveraging specimens from Project Viva, a prospective birth cohort recruited in Boston, MA to 1)
Determine if a prenatal mixture of first trimester metals and PFAS are individually and jointly associated as a
mixture with cord blood cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation at birth; 2) Quantify the extent to which a prenatal
metal/PFAS mixture is associated with Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (TDAP) and Measles, Mumps, and
Rubella (MMR) vaccine titers in mid-childhood (~7 years of age) and evaluate the extent to which postnatal
childhood metal and PFAS exposure contributes to this relationship; and 3) Test if DNA methylation signatures
at birth measured in leukocytes mediate associations between prenatal chemical exposure and reduced TDAP
and MMR vaccine antibody response in childhood. In this project we will test longitudinal associations in a large
cohort of mother-child pairs with detailed confounder information and existing high-quality data and samples. We
will implement novel statistical methodology to test different prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures to
comprehensively quantify the impact of chemical exposures on the developing immune system and vaccine-
induced immunity. This project will provide critical knowledge on the developmental immunotoxicity of PFAS and
metals, individually and as a mixture, at environmentally relevant concentrations for the U.S. population. The
immune parameters of this research are clinically relevant and will help inform risk assessments for individuals
as well as public health guidelines with the goal of protecting children."
10877953,"PROJECT 3: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Highly halogenated compounds include recently recognized pollutants such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl
substances (PFAS) as well as legacy contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PFAS and other extremely persistent halogenated
compounds do not exist alone in sites. For example, chlorinated solvents (e.g., trichloroethylene) often coexist
with 1,4-dioxane and PFAS, as well as fuel components including benzene and xylene. Highly halogenated
compounds remain in sites even when co-contaminants have been remediated, posing continued environmental
health risks to human receptors through exposure via drinking water sources and food. As more highly
halogenated chemicals are discovered, remediation strategies need to combine both selectivity and high
reactivity. For decades bioremediation has been attractive due to selective enzymes targeting specific
contaminants. Likewise, chemical redox treatment has garnered interest due to its high reactivity. However, it
takes decades to evolve new specific enzymes in nature and the harsh site conditions after chemical treatment
are drawbacks to both technologies when applied alone. Biological enzymatic systems that produce radicals are
widespread in microbial systems in aerobic and anaerobic environments. We hypothesize that these biological-
radical systems could become a novel remediation approach that combines both selectivity and high
reactivity.
In Aim 1, we propose to employ bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques to study known and putative
laccase systems with multiple chemical mediator compounds in high throughput assays to determine optimized
systems for PFAS treatment. Aim 2 focuses on studying the reactions of anaerobic radical systems, such as
glycyl radical enzymes (GRE) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to study their capability to be engineered future
remediation strategies. We will combine Project 3 and 4 approaches in Aim 3, where chemical treatment will be
used to prime pollutants that make them more amenable to subsequent biological radical treatment, as well as
study the microbial community dynamics before and after chemical treatment. The findings of Project 3 could
provide a new approach of remediation technologies to remediate highly halogenated emerging and legacy
compounds in the environment to protect the environmental health of surrounding communities."
10877954,"PROJECT 4: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 After 40 years of research and field experience, the remediation of hazardous waste
sites remains a substantial challenge. Over the past three decades, considerable progress has
been made in the use of in situ treatment methods, such as bioremediation and permeable
reactive barriers. Nonetheless, excavation and off-site disposal remains the most common
remedial approach for soil and groundwater extraction (i.e., pump-and-treat) systems are still
being employed at numerous Superfund sites. Among the emerging alternatives to these
expensive approaches, in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) has shown substantial potential for
providing an effective means of remediating a variety of contaminants, including TCE and
petroleum hydrocarbons. Despite its popularity, ISCO has proven difficult to use in the
treatment of hydrophobic compounds and compounds that exhibit low reactivity towards
hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical—the two strongest oxidants produced during the
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and peroxydisulfate (i.e., persulfate) in the subsurface.
Our proposed research aims at developing new in situ chemical remediation techniques capable
of treating Superfund contaminants that often require expensive ex-situ methods, (fully
halogenated organic solvents, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), polybrominated biphenyl ethers
(PBDEs), and per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS)) by employing Anaerobic
Radical Treatment (ART).
 In Aim 1, we propose to develop and optimize anaerobic thermally activated persulfate
methods to dehalogenate recalcitrant contaminants. We will develop a kinetic model that will
account for temperature, pH, oxidant dose, contaminant concentration, and oxygen
concentration. In Aim 2, we will develop a method that employs the use of co-solvent flushing
followed by ART. In anaerobic conditions, activated persulfate can react with alcohols to form
carbon centered radicals that are able to degrade contaminants. We also predict that persulfate
can activate at lower temperature in the presence of solvents, which will allow for more efficient
treatment of complex chemical mixtures. This includes aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) used
at sites contaminated with halogenated solvents. Aim 3 is focused on the discovery and fate of
stable transformation products formed during ART. In collaboration with Project 3, we will
investigate biodegradability of transformation products in microcosm studies. Aim 4 focuses on
predicting possible modes of toxicity by utilizing computational toxicity models, screening with
biomolecule assays, as well as established bioassay such as the Ames test. The results of
Project 4 could provide novel approaches for the remediation of highly halogenated emerging
and legacy compounds in the environment, while providing new models and methods for
minimizing toxic transformation products."
10877956,"CORE A: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Administration Core (AC) will provide the leadership and support needed to realize the Center’s overall
goals of addressing complex challenges related to Superfund contaminants including: characterizing mixed
and early-life exposures and perinatal health effects in disadvantaged communities; understanding interactions
among mixed exposures at hazardous waste sites and in health impact assessment; and, developing novel
methods for in situ remediation and remediation of persistent chemicals. Our goals address all four SRP
mandates and the needs of key stakeholders, including those tasked with advancing California’s Human Right
to Water Law. The Directors and RT Coordinator will work closely with Project and Core Leaders and the
External Advisory Board (EAB), engage in regular bi-directional communication and information exchange with
the Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB), plan and coordinate Center activities, and generate and share timely
information and tools (e.g., remediation technology, data and analytical tools) with NIEHS SRP and
organizations that can improve public health through regulatory and policy change. In Aim 1, the Directors and
RT Coordinator will hold monthly Center meetings to coordinate overall research progress and to foster, plan,
facilitate, and monitor interdisciplinary research and activities across our Center, and between Centers. They
will also hold smaller focused meetings such as weekly ToxicTeam meetings focused on data science and
sharing. They will review progress with the EAB at an annual meeting and interim meetings. In Aim 2, the
Directors and RT Coordinator will interact with the SAB such as by convening expert committees and hosting
workshops and seminars to develop and apply the Key Characteristics (KCs) of Hazard Identification and co-
hosting panels at meetings of mutual interest including those organized by stakeholder organizations. In Aim 3,
the Directors and RT Coordinator will support IIRT by identifying and sharing opportunities for interaction and
facilitating related events; by developing plain language summaries and lightning talks with the Trainees; and
by sharing KC, epidemiological, and exposure data to support assessment, with agencies including CalEPA. In
Aim 4, the AC will work with campus offices to license or commercialize technologies and identify pilot sites to
test in situ remediation technologies with Bruce Marvin at Geosyntec. In Aim 5, we will host interactive
workshops and meetings on cross-cutting topics such as characterization of early-life exposures and
interaction of mixtures in health assessment and remediation, using an effective format and presentation-style
that is accessible to diverse stakeholders and community organizations. The Directors and RT Coordinator will
coordinate with RETCC, to ensure a holistic Trainee experience and to facilitate trans- and interdisciplinary
training and research opportunities; with DMAC, to promote and share diverse datasets with stakeholders and
SRP; and with CEC, to engage with community and environmental justice organizations in Center activities."

Despite increased use of insulin pumps (IP) and continuous glucose monitors (CGM) for pediatric type 1 diabetes
(T1D) management and research studies showing benefits from the use of these devices, real-world glycemic
control among youth with T1D has worsened in recent years. The lack of improvement in glycemic control despite
increased use of these technologies indicates that youth receiving routine clinical T1D care are not realizing the
full potential of IP and CGM. Although greater youth and parental diabetes knowledge is associated with better
glycemic control, education alone is not sufficient to bring about the behavioral changes needed to improve
outcomes in T1D. Psychoeducation recognizes the need to blend educational and behavioral approaches,
including problem-solving and goal-setting, to support parents in developing optimal T1D management
approaches. There are currently a lack of effective standardized tools to support patients and families in
developing the knowledge and behavioral strategies needed to optimize the use of diabetes technologies. The
development of innovative family-centered psychoeducational tools addressing both behavior and knowledge
will help to realize the full potential of diabetes technologies to improve glycemic control and quality of life while
ultimately preventing or delaying the development of both acute and long-term complications of T1D.
The scientific goal of this proposal is to identify the unmet psychoeducational needs of parents of children 8-12 years
of age using IP and CGM for pediatric T1D management and to leverage that information to develop an innovative
psychoeducational intervention to optimize use of these technologies and improve T1D outcomes. In Aim 1,
semantic content analysis of interviews involving children with T1D, their parents, and diabetes clinicians will be
used to identify unmet educational and behavioral needs of parents and children using these technologies. We
previously developed an app-delivered T1D technology education curriculum for clinicians and in Aim 2 will use
instructional design and stakeholder input to adapt the existing curriculum to meet the specific needs of parents of
school age children with T1D. Finally, in Aim 3, we will pilot this psychoeducational intervention. Parents will
complete 4 months of the app-delivered psychoeducational curriculum and dyads will also meet with a diabetes
educator trained in motivational interviewing to reinforce knowledge and problem solving skills learned in the
curriculum by applying them to personal IP and CGM data. With the support of my mentors and advisory
committee comprised of experts in T1D behavioral interventions, medical and family-facing education, and
qualitative research, I will attain the career development goals of learning advanced techniques in qualitative and
quantitative research, developing expertise in family-facing psychoeducational interventions, and cultivating the
leadership skills needed to translate my findings into clinical practice. This mentored career development award
will support my development as an independent investigator capable of harnessing the unmet potential of
diabetes technologies. Outcomes will be used to power a randomized controlled trial for a future R01 submission."

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for
the ongoing human pandemic (COVID-19) that has been classed as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). There is an urgent demand for SARS-CoV-2 research to
facilitate the development of therapeutics, understand viral replication and pathogenesis, and determine how the
virus spreads from cell-to-cell as well as patient to patient. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS are among
the most dangerous pathogens on Earth, with high fatality rates and lack of viable therapeutics or vaccines.
They are classified as category C pathogens by the NIH due to their ease of production and dissemination with
the potential of high morbidity and mortality. Detailed mechanistic studies on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
replication and viral shedding (i.e., budding) may inform identification of new drug targets in the viral life cycle
and enrich our understanding of how this zoonotic pathogen utilizes host cell lipids to build the viral lipid envelope.
 The Stahelin and Voth laboratories, building on collaborations with each other and specific expertise in
biochemistry, biophysics and computational studies of virus assembly, will use experimental in vitro and cellular
studies integrated with computational analysis to investigate the central hypothesis in this grant: that selective
lipid-protein interactions drive the assembly and budding of the M (membrane) and N (nucleoprotein) of SARS-
CoV-2. In two specific aims, we will (i) determine the cellular and biophysical mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-
2 M form virus particles in silico, in vitro and in human cells and (ii) determine how N lipid binding drives
localization that contributes to formation of new viral particles. These studies will be integrated with structural
biology of M (Browhan laboratory) and N (Ollmann Saphire laboratory) and also be validated with authentic
SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility in collaboration with the Kuhn laboratory.
 These questions will be studied in a tightly integrated approach using structural and in vitro quantitative
techniques to assess lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions and cellular assays to tease apart the
molecular underpinnings of viral protein interactions necessary for viral budding and infection. Computationally,
we will use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the assembly process on
the membrane and to identify a set of models for further refinement through all-atom (AA) MD simulations. This
innovative and integrated approach will not only provide careful validation of the results, but also provide detailed
structural insights into the lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions governing the assembly and budding of
SARS-CoV-2. The protein interfaces of M and N identified in these studies, which will be key for virus assembly
and spread, will inform future drug targeting against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses."

 Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), modulate
anti-tumor immunity and are major targets of current checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. However,
clinical trials of αPD-L1/αPD-1 antibodies in breast cancer to date have demonstrated only limited efficacy. The
importance of a breast-specific tumor microenvironment (TME) in regulating anti-tumor immunity is vastly under-
explored. Given the abundance of adipocytes in breast tissue, the well-documented association between
adiposity and breast cancer-related mortality, and the emerging obesity paradox in anticancer immunotherapy, it
is imperative to investigate the molecular underpinnings of the complex adipose-immune-tumor network within
the adipocyte-rich breast TME.
 We recently identified a previously unappreciated, functionally significant source of PD-L1 in white
adipocytes. Adipocyte PD-L1 is markedly induced during adipogenesis and obesity-related chronic
inflammation. Using an adipocyte-specific knockout mouse model, we demonstrate an important role of
adipocyte PD-L1 in promotion of tumor growth and attenuation of anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, our
preliminary data indicate physical and functional interactions between PD-L1 and lipid metabolism-related proteins
and pathways in adipocytes, which suggests an adipocyte-intrinsic function of PD-L1. Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that adipocyte PD-L1 impedes anti-tumor lymphocytes and/or abets tumor cells through
a lipid metabolism-related mechanism. We further propose that this action of adipocyte PD-L1 is particularly
important at the tumor margin of immune-excluded tumors, where adipocytes are in proximity with both tumor
and immune cells. We will combine our established tools and expertise in cancer biology, tumor immunology,
and transcriptional regulation to validate this novel hypothesis through the following Aims: (1) Delineate how
adipocyte PD-L1 mediates adipose-immune-tumor crosstalk, (2) Determine how adipocyte PD-L1 expression
is regulated, and (3) Determine how adipocyte PD-L1 impacts immunotherapy in obese vs non-obese hosts.
 Our studies on adipocyte PD-L1 signaling in lipid metabolism will provide new molecular explanations for
PD-L1 action in tumor immunology, a clear departure from the prevailing paradigm regarding tumor/immune
PD-L1 actions. This proposed work represents a conceptual advance toward understanding the spatial
landscape of the breast TME in immune regulation and tumorigenesis – a clinically relevant yet mechanistically
under-explored problem. Our results could lay a solid foundation for developing new tools that predict and
enhance therapeutic response to aPD-1/aPD-L1 immunotherapy for breast cancer patients, especially those
with obesity."
10882164,"Peripheral nerve injury can result in loss of cutaneous sensory function, with associated defects in protective
reflexes and tactile function, as well as neuropathic pain. While regeneration from injured nerve is the best-
studied mechanism of reinnervation following injury, it is inherently slow even with surgical augmentation.
Collateral sprouting from neighboring uninjured neurons represents an additional mechanism for recovery.
Although axonal regeneration has been studied extensively, much less is known about the mechanistic basis or
functional consequences of collateral sprouting. After peripheral nerve injury, macrophages are recruited into or
proliferate within the injured nerve stump and areas undergoing Wallerian degeneration, where they play pivotal
roles in phagocytic removal of neuronal and myelin debris and facilitate the regeneration of injured axons.
However, changes and potential functions of macrophages in denervated skin after nerve injury remain less
studied. In this project, we will explore the hypothesis that macrophages promote skin reinnervation by collateral
sprouting of uninjured nociceptors after peripheral nerve injury. In Aim 1, we will characterize changes in the
abundance, localization, morphology, and phenotype of macrophages in denervated skin over time and define
the anatomical relationship of these cells to sprouting nociceptive fibers. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that
macrophages are essential for normal nociceptor sprouting and functional sensory recovery by quantifying
sprouting-mediated skin reinnervation and behavioral sensory recovery after SNI surgery in mice in which
macrophages have been globally or locally depleted. In Aim 3, to define the mechanisms by which macrophages
promote collateral sprouting after nerve injury, we will assess whether macrophage depletion alters peripheral
nerve injury-induced upregulation of sprouting-associated genes (SAGs) in spared nociceptive neurons. We also
will use in vitro DRG neuron culture to examine the impact of prior in vivo injury, with or without macrophage
depletion, on neurite outgrowth and branching. Finally, we will ask whether in vitro exposure of DRG neurons to
either paw skin or macrophages isolated after nerve injury alters axon outgrowth or branching. Success in this
proposal will allow us to elucidate the importance of cutaneous macrophages in anatomical and functional
sensory recovery by collateral sprouting. It will also help to identify candidate transcriptional and cell biological
changes driving these effects and establish a system with which to subsequently identify the responsible
secreted macrophages effectors. Based on our findings, targeting of the recruitment, differentiation, survival, or
effector function of macrophages might be explored as therapeutic strategies to promote the progression of
sensory recovery and/or limit unwanted events such as chronic pain after peripheral nerve injury."

 Kinship ties form the bedrock of societies and provide meaning in terms of roles, obligations, and responsi-
bilities. Generational overlap in the form of shared lifetimes represents a fundamental condition guiding
whether and how kin relationships may develop and the extent to which resources are shared. Yet, we know
little about the prevalence, duration, or life course timing of generational overlap, how it varies by socioeco-
nomic status, and how it may potentially influence individual health and wellbeing. Generational overlap is con-
sequential because it offers an important perspective for observing the demographic constraints on multigener-
ational family investments in children. We propose to provide new information about the overlap in shared life-
times for grandchildren and grandparents across two industrialized countries – the U.S. and Denmark. Both
countries have experienced declines and delays in fertility, lengthening life expectancies, and notable educa-
tional expansion in the 20th century, but these have occurred on different timelines, to different degrees, and
within different social policy regimes. We use harmonized data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the
Danish population register, the Add Health Parent Study and the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in
Europe to evaluate generational overlap and its implications across historical time. We consider three genera-
tions – grandparents (G1), parents (G2), and grandchildren (G3) and focus on grandparents born since 1912.
We address three specific aims: 1) Provide a descriptive portrait of the prevalence and length of generational
overlap for grandparents (G1) and grandchildren (G3) in the U.S. and Denmark using an innovative age-pe-
riod-cohort approach; 2) Explicate the role of educational expansion in shifting generational overlap, including
the specific case of within-family intergenerational mobility where diminished generational overlap may be an
unanticipated `cost' of intergenerational mobility; 3) Document the social class gradient in grandparents' life
course position (employment status, health, and proximity to kin) arising from the timing and duration of gener-
ational overlap and describe the intergenerational exchanges of time, money, and care that result – and for
Denmark, consider subsequent health/wellbeing for G1-G3. We attend to further variation by gender, family
structure, and (for the U.S.) race/ethnicity. In sum, shared lifetimes among grandparents, parents and grand-
children represent a key aspect of how kinship ties shape individual life courses. We explore how the duration,
quality, and consequences of these shared lifetimes are shaped by demographic processes across genera-
tions. This project will be led by an outstanding team of established collaborators who are leaders in the fields
of family demography and social inequality and who possess the methodological skill and expert knowledge of
each data source to achieve the study's aims. These findings have important implications for the intergenera-
tional transmission of inequality, as well as potential resource demands on governments and families."

Flow cytometry is a powerful technology that has applications in immunology, infectious diseases, molecular
biology, cancer biology, etc. It allows for rapid characterization of particles and mixed cell populations isolated
from various tissues. Using lasers as light sources, a flow cytometer produces scattered and fluorescent
signals thus allowing simultaneous examination of cell size, granularity, cell marker and cytokine expression. In
this shared instrumentation proposal funding is sought to purchase a FACSymphony A1 for Southern Illinois
University-Carbondale (SIUC). The FACSymphony A1 uses a single fixed excitation optical assembly that
consists of four spatially separated high-power Blue, Red, Violet, and Yellow Green lasers. Emission optics
uses fiber optics to deliver the emitted light to the detector arrays, which use reflection to maximize signal
detection and can detect up to 16 fluorochromes. This system features VPX ultra-low noise electronics,
improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The Small Particle Detector can resolve particles as small as 90 nm. This
equipment will allow SIUC researchers to use the full spectrum of commercially available fluorescent dyes in
their research. This equipment will contribute to research programs across two SIU colleges and the SIU
School of Medicine. All the users mentor undergraduate and graduate students, and this instrument will
provide opportunities to train students in cutting-edge technologies and experimental design. The
FACSymphony A1 will also be incorporated into two laboratory courses at SIUC. Educational potential for this
equipment will have a broad reach through the partnership with the SI Bridges program. This NIH-funded
program connects community college students with ongoing undergraduate research opportunities at SIUC.
The FACSymphony A1 will enhance the biomedical research capacity and have a meaningful impact on
biomedical education at SIUC."
10882307,"A technology that enables biomolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, to be imaged at
nanoscale precision throughout preserved 3-D specimens would enable a greater understanding
of life processes and disease detection. This would be beneficial in fields such as neuroscience
and oncology where many complex questions remain unanswered. The ability to map the
locations of specific types of biomolecules within subcellular compartments would give insight into
cellular organization and any altered state in disease. With the advent of expanding microscopy
(ExM), it is now possible to obtain nanoscale images using only a diffraction-limited light
microscope. This simple yet novel approach uses water-swellable polymers to physically expand
biological specimens to be imaged at approximately 70 nm resolution.
While the protocol for expansion and the retention of intracellular antigen have progressed rapidly
since ExM was first developed, currently available methods are limited by linear expansion of 4-
5 times of their original size. A higher expansion factor is needed to reveal the subtle changes in
the size, shape, and texture ratio of subcellular organelles in health status or disease. More
importantly, almost all the current ExM methods require a specific anchoring step to ensure
targeted biomolecules are covalently linked to the newly synthesized hydrogel. A universal
biomolecule anchor that works for thick tissues remains elusive. Additionally, few existing ExM
approaches can expand diverse tissue types other than the brain without losing most of the
epitopes. Thus there is tremendous pent-up demand for a method of nanoscale imaging for
extended 3-D specimens and/or with highly versatile molecular contrast.
Given its potential impact, we now propose a new framework called Magnify to bring the power
and versatility of ExM to next generation. We will focus on the following aspects: (1) Develop a
robust one-shot 11× expansion microscopy with universal biomolecule retention; (2) Further
develop Magnify for expanding mm-scale thick tissues and whole small animals; (3) Extend
Magnify for super-resolution vibrational imaging, including label-free, metabolic and multicolor
super-resolution imaging. We will demonstrate the potential of Magnify as a powerful tool for
mapping subcellular proteomic changes in diverse tissues, cells, and organelles by visualizing
molecular spatial patterns at unprecedented high spatial resolution throughout preserved
specimens."

 The overall objective of this project is to develop nucleic acid binding polymers that can scavenge
extracellular nucleic acid-containing Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) in the setting of
pancreatic cancer therapy to mitigate activation of cancer cell migration and metastasis safely and effectively.
Our translational hypothesis is that treatment of pancreatic cancer patients with chemotherapy or surgery
induces the release of such nucleic acid-containing DAMPs and that administration of a second-generation
nucleic acid-containing DAMP scavenger during such therapy will be particularly impactful as it will safely limit
the ability of cancer cells to respond to and mobilize as a result of such proinflammatory treatments.
 The White and Sullenger labs started to collaboratively explore the ability of NASs to neutralize the
downstream TLR mediated and pro-invasive effects of extracellular nucleic acids and nucleic acid-containing
(NA) DAMPs to improve PC therapy. As we jointly reported, administration of the NAS PAMAM-G3
dramatically reduced metastases of syngeneic KPC pancreatic cancer cells to the liver of mice while also
reducing circulating cfDNA levels. Our published data suggest that: 1] inflammation and the presence of
activated inflammatory cells and platelets in the tumor and periphery promote cancer invasion and metastasis
and 2] modulating inflammation with a NAS controls cancer invasion and metastasis. Though our initial
analyses is quite encouraging, it has a major limitation that needs to be addressed to facilitate translation of
this NAS strategy to the clinic. Specifically, the NAS PAMAM-G3 we have used has well known dose limiting
toxicities. For this reason, the Sullenger lab has developed a new generation NAS, called PAMAM-G3 50:50,
that retains the ability to scavenge nucleic acid DAMPs in vitro and in vivo while greatly reducing NAS-
associated toxicity. Moreover, the Sullenger laboratory has recently started to evaluate a cationic cyclodextrin
polymer (CDP), that has already been translated into the clinic for siRNA delivery in melanoma cancer
patients, for its ability to scavenge DAMPs and limit metastasis in the setting of pancreatic cancer. We believe
that both of these agents should have wider therapeutic windows than the first generation NAS, PAMAM-G3.
The Sullenger and White labs propose to evaluate the potential of these two second generation NASs and the
DAMP scavenging therapeutic approach to set the stage for IND-enabling studies for translation of this
innovative strategy into the clinic to attempt to improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients. The
Sullenger lab will be responsible for all in vitro NAS biochemistry and nucleic acid DAMP analyses as well as
all animal models not involving patient derived xenografts. The White lab will be responsible for all studies
involving human samples including animal models that utilize patient derived tumor xenografts. Dr. Sullenger
and Dr. White will share all findings and meet via Zoom at least twice per month."
10880916,"Project Summary
One of the most highly debated questions for caregivers of deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) children and the
professionals who serve them is that of which “communication mode” to use. Will the child have higher
language skills if they are taught American Sign Language (ASL) or spoken English or both? Caregivers face
this decision when their child is diagnosed, their hearing status changes, and they show language difficulties.
Professional guidance is hampered by contradictory perspectives and limited evidence on how communication
mode affects long-term outcomes. Limited data for language growth expectations make it unclear whether a
DHH child is making sufficient progress to achieve age expectations. The relevant data are spotty, especially
for ASL, and often restricted to a subpopulation, single measure, and/or short time span. As a result, DHH
children are at risk for receiving ineffective intervention. To provide vital empirical guidance on the impact of
exposure to ASL and/or English and whether children are making expected progress, we first need to
characterize the language development of DHH children who vary in their access to signed versus spoken
languages and developmental histories. Currently, no such natural history data exists, which is a major
roadblock. Our team will collaborate with the Kansas Language Assessment Program – DHH to analyze data
from one of the largest sources of ASL and English development data currently available. We create growth
curves of expressive ASL and English skills of 250 DHH children (0–8 years old) from this population-based
sample. These models will provide novel information regarding the natural history of language development in
DHH children, which is critical for making intervention decisions and improving language outcomes (Aim 1).
Without knowledge of expected developmental trajectories and which lead to age-expected language skills,
professionals currently risk providing suboptimal or even detrimental amounts or types of intervention. We also
initiate a programmatic line of research to identify sources of variation in language outcomes across DHH
children and then address malleable factors to improve outcomes. In this proposed project, we focus on
elucidating the effects of language access on language growth because our sample is uniquely positioned to
address this far-reaching and longstanding question (Aims 2 and 3). Importantly, the participants are exposed
to varying amounts of ASL and English and such data are collected systematically. We not only evaluate the
influence of language access on ASL and English growth, but also its predictive value when traditional
communication mode (i.e., ""sign"" versus ""oral”) is already accounted for (Aim 3). This study provides a robust
foundation for analyzing an enduring population-based sample with enormous potential. Future studies will
take advantage of the growing sample to predict longer-term outcomes and intervene on malleable factors to
improve outcomes. Improving outcomes is critical because of the persistent language deficits for DHH
individuals and long-term negative academic, vocational, and social implications."

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Unfortunately, many
patients progress to kidney failure. IgAN is defined by the characteristic IgA1 mesangial deposits. Based on
our published data, we proposed a hypothesis that describes sequential steps in the pathogenesis of IgAN.
This multi-hit process is recognized by other researchers in the field as a blueprint for the development of
disease-specific biomarkers and treatments. In the past funding period, we showed that most IgAN patients
produce pathogenic IgA1-containing immune complexes. We determined that these complexes consist of
polymeric IgA1 with some hinge-region O-glycans deficient in galactose (Gd-IgA1) and devoid of sialic acid
(asialo-Gd-IgA1). These IgA1 glycoforms are recognized by IgG autoantibodies, resulting in the formation of
circulating immune complexes, some of which deposit in glomeruli. We have determined that IgG in glomerular
immunodeposits of IgAN patients is specific for asialo-Gd-IgA1. Using our in vitro and in vivo models of IgAN,
we demonstrated that i) large-molecular-mass Gd-IgA1-IgG immune complexes are pathogenic; ii)
complement C3 is covalently attached to IgA1 and IgG in these complexes; iii) C3 is required for the biological
activity of those complexes in vitro and in vivo; and iv) these IgG-Gd-IgA1-C3 complexes activate multiple
signaling pathways in mesangial cells. Despite progress in the identification of genetic and biochemical factors
involved in IgAN pathogenesis, there are still many gaps in our knowledge. To address these gaps, we will use
biospecimens from IgAN patients of opposing clinical phenotypes, i.e., with progressive vs. non-progressive
disease, to determine the factors that are associated with disease progression. Based on our pilot
experiments, we hypothesize that IgA1 immune complexes of IgAN patients with progressive disease have
greater biological activity than do the complexes of patients with non-progressive IgAN. We further hypothesize
that variances in the composition of these complexes determine differences in biological activity. For the
circulating IgA1 immune complexes from IgAN patients with progressive vs. non-progressive disease, we will
determine their size and biological activity (to induce cellular proliferation, signaling, and cytokine production in
mesangial cells; Aim 1). We will determine molecular O-glycophenotypes of IgA1 in the circulating immune
complexes of IgAN patients with progressive vs. non-progressive disease (Aim 2) and determine the impact of
C3 processing and the presence of complement-regulating proteins on the activity of IgA1 immune complexes
(Aim 3). To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team that will leverage our access
to well-characterized clinical samples and our innovative in vitro and in vivo models of IgAN. Relevance: The
results from these studies will provide molecular-level details concerning factors that determine the pathogenic
potential of IgA1 immune complexes in IgAN. This knowledge will guide the development of future therapies of
IgAN and provide critical information concerning the stratification of patients for clinical trials."
10882625,"Project Summary:
In the vestibular system of the inner ear, motion is detected via the mechanical deflection of a bundle of
stereocilia located at the top of sensory receptor hair cells. The bundle is morphologically and physiologically
polarized because only movements of the bundle towards a lone kinocilium positioned at one side of the apical
cell surface are able to produce excitatory responses to acceleration or gravity. Thus, the range of motion that
can be detected by an individual hair cell is determined by the polarized orientation of the stereociliary bundle.
The utricle and saccule contain thousands of vestibular hair cells that detect linear accelerations which are
divided between two groups that have opposite stereociliary bundle orientations and therefore respond to motion
in opposite directions. These two groups of hair cells meet at a cellular junction that anatomically divides the
utricle and saccule called the Line of Polarity Reversal (LPR).
Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that direct the development of planar polarity and
the LPR, and underlie the formation of a sensory representation of gravity and acceleration in the mouse utricle
and saccule. This will be addressed throughout the course of the project using a combination of knockout and
transgenic mouse models, molecular genetic approaches to evaluate the transcriptional regulation of an
essential regulatory kinase called STK32A, and biochemical and proteomics approaches to identify STK32A
substrates. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that patterns of Stk32a gene expression are determined by
the transcription factor EMX2, and that STK32A guides stereociliary bundle orientation in hair cells that do not
express EMX2. STK32A is a dark kinase with previously unknown function, which my lab has recently shown to
be necessary and sufficient to determine stereociliary bundle orientation. This effort is significant and innovative
because it introduces post-translational modification by kinase signaling as a new regulatory mechanism guiding
hair cell planar polarity, and because it focuses on the EMX2-negative hair cells that were previously excluded
from studies, including my own, that focused specifically on EMX2. Although directed towards the development
of vestibular planar polarity, we anticipate that this research will impact our understanding of auditory planar
polarity as well as other organ systems that rely upon cellular polarization for growth or function."
10882689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Due to organ shortage, livers are transplanted in order of recipient medical urgency; however, ethical principles
dictate avoidance of futile transplantation. The most common cause of death early after liver transplant (i.e.
futility) relates to consequences of an immune system which is frail or dysfunctional prior to transplant. We
have previously identified the Liver Immune Frailty Index (LIFI), a pre-transplant biomarker panel that
predicts risk of early post-transplant death. In our discovery cohort of 279 liver transplant recipients, pre-
transplant measurement of LIFI, based on HCV IgG, and plasma Fractalkine, and MMP3, can discriminate risk
of death within one-year following liver transplant with a c-statistic of 0.84 and a false-positive rate of 4%. LIFI-
low corresponds to 1.4% one-year mortality compared with 58.3% for LIFI-high. Multicenter validation is
necessary to advance the LIFI as an objective clinical index to predict the risk of liver transplant futility.
Mechanistically, our data suggest that immune frailty may relate to skewed intracellular energetics and immune
cell exhaustion. These alterations likely result from severe cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. In
preliminary studies, LIFI was determined at the time of transplant. Pre-transplant immune dysfunction is likely a
fluid process and may also be responsible for decompensation and death on the waitlist. Based on this, we
hypothesize that patients listed for LT exhibit both progressive pre-LT immune dysfunction (immune frailty) and
cirrhosis-related physical frailty, which predisposes patients to wait-list and early post-LT mortality. The
cumulative effect is detectable with serum biomarkers of immune dysfunction. To evaluate this, we have
established the Liver Immune Frailty Evaluation (LIFE) Consortium, comprised of six centers whose
volume encompasses almost 10% of annual US liver transplants. Plasma, PBMCs, radiographic, and clinical
data will be collected from waitlisted patients at LIFE centers. In Aim 1, we will perform multicenter validation
and refinement of the LIFI. In Aim 2, we will longitudinally assess biomarkers of immune dysfunction and AI-
driven body composition analysis (physical frailty) among waitlisted patients who either receive liver transplant
or who expire due to severe decompensation prior to or early post-liver transplant. We will also expand our
understanding of the development of immune frailty through targeted multiomic assessment. This study serves
as a direct extension and complement to our ongoing evaluation of severe pre-transplant immune dysfunction,
currently supported by a NIDDK K08 Award. Outcomes from this study will advance LIFI as a novel objective
index for pre-transplant patient assessment, and will expand understanding of immune frailty development.
IMPACT: LIFI is an innovative index that provides crucial insight into liver transplant candidate immune
function and risk of post-transplant mortality, and no alternative pre-transplant clinical indices provide this key
data. Validation and pre-transplant correlation of LIFI is critical to improve transplant timing, prevent wasting of
livers in high-risk patients, and identify therapeutic targets to reverse immune frailty and improve outcomes."
10882690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The female reproductive tract (FRT) mucosa is routinely invaded by pathogenic viruses. Resident memory CD8
T cells (TRM) have proven antiviral roles in this barrier tissue. Recent studies in mice and non-human primates
have demonstrated that when present in sufficient numbers, TRM can mediate rapid antiviral protection.
Responding CD8 TRM elicit immediate effector functions, recruit a network of antiviral immune cells and limit
pathogen spread beyond the initial replication site. However, efforts to establish high density CD8 TRM that are
durably maintained have yet to be realized. This is largely due to an incomplete understanding of the cellular
and molecular signals that regulate CD8 TRM differentiation, enables their poised effector state and maintain
them long term. Heterogeneity among TRM populations, which has recently become appreciated, further
compounds this lack of understanding. This proposal seeks to understand the CD8 TRM diversity and define the
processes that control CD8 TRM differentiation in the reproductive mucosa. Our phenotypic and single cell RNA
sequencing studies have identified two major subsets of FRT TRM that are marked by mutually exclusive
expression of CD103 and Ly6C. While both subsets were largely resident as determined by parabiosis, CD103+
cells resembled classical epithelial TRM cells but Ly6C+ cells displayed properties of circulating effector cells.
Further exploration into their biogenesis showed that CD103+ cells were dependent on TGF-β signaling for their
formation as well as maintenance. Interestingly, exposure to inflammation drove the formation of Ly6C+ TRM.
We will utilize both in vivo infection models and a novel in vitro vaginal organoid system to understand the cellular
and molecular drivers of these two distinct TRM subsets. We will pursue two aims. In aim-1, we will determine
the role of type-1 interferon in promoting Ly6C+ TRM generation. We will also test if CD103+ and Ly6C+ subsets
represent terminal TRM states or are capable of further differentiation. Importantly we will assess the relative
protective roles of both TRM subsets against pathogen challenges. Finally, we will examine if vaginal microbial
dysbiosis modulates the differentiation of each subset. In aim-2, we will investigate the cellular and molecular
circuitry responsible for regulating TGF-β signaling in FRT TRM. Specifically, we will assess the timing and
source of TGF-β signals necessary for establishing and maintaining FRT TRM. We will identify cells that support
integrin-mediated activation of TGF-β in the FRT. These studies will be achieved by a combination of inducible
genetic mouse models and antibody-based approaches. The overall purpose of this project is to understand the
mechanisms driving the generation and maintenance of FRT TRM. The findings from this work will inform
targeted therapies to improve TRM lodgment, functional tuning, and survival to achieve effective immune
surveillance in the reproductive mucosa."
10880793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) call for all
pregnant people to be offered screening and diagnostic testing options for aneuploidy and carrier screening for
cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. As a result, the nearly 4 million pregnant people receiving prenatal
care in the United States annually require access to the associated, and complex, prenatal genetic counseling.
With these considerations and a commitment to person centered-care, informed decision-making is critical, and
predicated on people having adequate knowledge of the benefits and risks of different testing options. Obstetric
care providers have the challenge of addressing an ever-increasing number of topics during the first prenatal
care visit, and prenatal genetic counselors face a high number of referrals. Yet there is a national shortage of
genetic counselors with an uneven geographic distribution. The resulting lack of access to standardized prenatal
genetic counseling can lead to patient misinterpretation of the goals or results of prenatal genetic testing and
may be contributing to socioeconomic and racial disparities in prenatal genetic screening and diagnosis.
Language barriers further exacerbate misunderstanding of prenatal genetic testing options. Mobile digital tools,
including chatbots, provide an attractive alternative to in-person genetic counseling due to the near ubiquitous
availability of mobile devices among patients and ability to ensure tailoring and standardization. Previous digital
tools developed for prenatal genetic education showed promise, but most are instructional than interactive,
computer-based rather than mobile-based, and do not include information on carrier screening currently
recommended by ACOG. To address this critical need, a multidisciplinary team of perinatologists, genetic
counselors, and digital health experts developed an innovative, patient-informed, mobile chatbot (iPrenatal) to
simulate a text and audio-based counseling discussion about aneuploidy screening and diagnosis. Preliminary
data from our randomized trial of 258 English-speaking pregnant people showed significantly higher post-
intervention knowledge scores among patients who used iPrenatal compared with those who received routine
provider education. We now propose to leverage this success by engaging users in formative work to create
iPrenatal+ and provide all content in English and Spanish. We will evaluate iPrenatal+ in a randomized controlled
trial of 1,470 pregnant people in clinics serving racially and socioeconomically diverse pregnant women. Our
specific aims are: Utilize human centered design to transform iPrenatal to an enhanced digital educational
chatbot (iPrenatal+) for prenatal genetic counseling (Aim 1), Determine the effect of iPrenatal+ on patient
knowledge and uptake of prenatal genetic testing, compared to in-person genetic counseling (Aim 2), and Assess
ability of iPrenatal+ to narrow the gap in knowledge and uptake of prenatal genetic screening between English-
and Spanish-speaking patients, compared to in person genetic counseling (Aim 3)."
10880795,"Project Summary/Abstract
Transition metal (TM) ions play myriad roles in biology and are present in >30% of structures in the PDB yet
the accurate computational modeling of these ions is less evolved than for the “organic” framework of proteins.
Hence, the simulation of metalloprotein structure, function and dynamics lags behind related studies on
proteins that do not contain TM ions. To address this issue multiple groups have built models validated using
varying criteria making it difficult to focus on best practices. Because of this gap in the modeling of TM ions
important biological problems associated with TM ion homeostasis, metal center assembly, TM/drug
interactions, dynamics of ligand association and product dissociation in metalloenzymes, attacking pathogens
using nutritional immunity via TM sequestration near infection sites, role of Fe(II)/Fe(III) in ferroptosis etc.
remain a significant challenge to computationally address. Through the systematic development of robust
computational models of TMs, hypotheses can be formed to address problems focused on TM ion biology at a
level currently available for systems lacking TM ions.
We propose that we can fundamentally advance the study of transition metal (TM) containing biological
systems by developing a freely available centralized software “hub” containing multiple validated classical force
field models for TM ions that will facilitate the routine and accurate modeling of the structure and
thermodynamics of TMs bound to proteins and in aqueous solution. Our long-term goal is to advance TM
modeling approaches, place them into the widely used AMBER simulation package and then validate and
disseminate the various methodologies to address problems involving metalloproteins by both the experimental
and computational communities. Moreover, in this proposal we hypothesize that our models will enhance our
ability to design metal binding sites and provide molecular-level insights into TM ion transport. The
fundamental biophysical and biochemical questions we are addressing are what controls the structure, function
and dynamics of TM ion complexation and TM ion transport in proteins. Building on our success with
developing class-leading bonded metal ion force fields we will create next generation models that can be
exploited in understanding the structural and functional role of TMs in biology."
10880864,"Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal disease, accounting for about 15% of all lung
cancers. SCLC patients often initially respond to chemotherapy; however, their tumors invariably recur within 6
to 12 months. Treatment regimens for SCLC have remained largely unchanged for the past decades.
Nonetheless, the addition of immunotherapy (such as anti-PD-L1 therapy) to chemotherapy was recently
approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although the clinical
benefit of adding anti-PD-L1 has been modest with an increase in median overall survival (OS) of approximately
2 months, these results have suggested that anti-tumor immunity can play a role in SCLC treatment. Notably,
there are limited options for treating SCLC with targeted agents, emphasizing the critical need for identifying new
targets and treatment paradigms. Our proposed studies address these unmet needs. SCLC has been
increasingly recognized as a highly heterogeneous disease, which is largely regulated by four transcription
factors (TFs). Neuroendocrine (NE) SCLC subtypes have been characterized by differential expression of the
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 TFs and non-NE SCLCs by POU2F3 and YAP1. A recent study demonstrated an
essential role of master regulator MYC in driving the evolution dynamics of these subtypes of SCLC, postulating
their dependence on mutual transcriptional and epigenetic programs for tumor initiation and survival. We aim to
leverage our recent discoveries for targeted therapy and state-of-the-art preclinical platform to identify novel
strategies that mitigate the common dependencies in heterogenous SCLC. We previously demonstrated that
SCLC cells are addicted to a CDK7-regulated gene expression program mediated, in part, by oncogenic
members of the MYC family of TFs and proto-oncogenic NE lineage TFs. Furthermore, our recent data has
uncovered a previously unrecognized role of MUC1-C in regulating common oncogenic transcriptomes in both
NE and non-NE SCLC. In addition, we have successfully established multiple orthotopic murine SCLC models,
which represent the four SCLC subtypes that include SCLC-ASCL1, -NEUROD1, -YAP1 and -POU2F3.
Importantly, these murine models have an intact lung immune system making them a powerful resource for
immune-oncology studies. Utilizing this preclinical platform, we will 1). evaluate the efficacy of MUC1-C inhibitor
alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibitor in NE and non-NE SCLC in vitro and in vivo; 2). define the TME
alterations induced by MUC1-C inhibition alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibition; and 3). define the
cancer intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms by which MUC1-C and CDK7 inhibition alone and in combination
contribute to antitumor immunity. Ultimately, characterizing the underlying mechanisms associated with
responses to our targeted therapies will help develop tailored treatment for SCLC patients."
10882933,"Routine mammographic screening for breast cancer reduces breast cancer mortality. On a mammogram,
radiologists assess mammographic density (MD), or the amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) in the breast,
which is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Women with dense breasts are more likely to be diagnosed in
the “interval” between screening exams, contributing to increased breast cancer mortality. However, current
screening guidelines for average-risk women do not take imaging risk markers into account. Women with very
high risk of breast cancer, regardless of MD, receive an intensified screening schedule with supplemental
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On MRI, radiologists assess FGT as well as
background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). BPE is the degree to which healthy FGT brightens due to
the presence of contrast, reflecting the metabolic activity within the FGT. We recently demonstrated that BPE
on MRI was associated with breast cancer risk independently of the amount of FGT. Other studies corroborate
our findings, supporting our premise that BPE is a new marker of breast cancer risk. However, due to the
select population receiving MRI, alternative measurement approaches are needed to increase the impact of
BPE for women who are not able to receive screening MRI. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an
increasingly-used breast screening modality that substantially improves breast cancer detection, comparable in
sensitivity to MRI. After injection of a contrast agent, two mammograms at high and low energies are taken in
quick succession. MD is assessed on the low-energy image and BPE is assessed subjectively by radiologists
as “minimal”, “mild”, “moderate”, or “marked” on a processed (“recombined”) image per the Breast Imaging –
Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). BI-RADS BPE measured on CEM has good agreement with BI-RADS
BPE measured on MRI. However, subjective measurement of BPE varies between readers, preventing
reproducible risk assessment research. An objective, quantitative measure of BPE on CEM is needed to
rigorously evaluate the relationship between increased BPE and breast cancer risk. To address this research
gap, we propose to assess the association between cancer and a fully automated measure of BPE on CEM.
Aim 1. Evaluate BPE as a reproducible marker of breast cancer risk: we will implement a fully automated
measure of quantitative BPE on 462 CEMs, evaluate the agreement with the gold standard BI-RADS measure,
and compare with BPE on MRI. Aim 2. Determine whether quantitative BPE improves breast cancer risk
assessment: in a matched case-control study of 154 newly diagnosed breast cases matched to 308 cancer-
free controls, we will determine the association of breast cancer with BPE, accounting for FGT, race/ethnicity,
reproductive factors, and other risk factors for breast cancer. Our long-term goal is to use quantitative BPE on
CEM to improve breast cancer risk assessment, thereby enabling personalization of breast cancer screening to
improve screening outcomes and reduce mortality due to breast cancer."
10883032,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The majority of 18-24-month-old autistic children have no words, demonstrating significant delays in their
language development, a leading source of concern that often brings them to the attention of physicians or
other professionals in community settings91,92. About half of these children continue to show significant
language delay, speaking no words at 30-33 months2 and exhibiting delays in language greater than
expected for their nonverbal cognitive age2. The period of development between 18-30 months is critical for
language learning, coinciding with the period of time parents note differences in their children’s
development93. We do not understand why some children begin to use words and others do not but speaking
early (before 36 months) has long-lasting and cascading effects on development94,95. This may be especially
true for low income, racially and ethnically diverse children who are diagnosed later, and when diagnosed,
often have lower cognitive/intellectual abilities8. Starting out with such disadvantage can limit opportunities for
children, tracking them into specialized and segregated settings that result in poorer outcomes overall.
Understanding why language outcomes diverge over this critical language learning window, especially for
economically disadvantaged children and/or those from historically marginalized groups, is essential to
optimize the targets and timing of early, effective interventions.
Therefore, a major gap in our knowledge concerns the measures and timing of when we can predict
spoken language outcomes of young children with autism, especially in historically marginalized and
minoritized populations. To explore the vast heterogeneity in language outcomes, it will be necessary to
deeply phenotype children using a range of concurrent neural and behavioral markers of spoken language and
examine how these changes progress over time. This study will be the first to collect simultaneous social
communication, language, sensory, motor development, and neural activity (via remote EEG) measures in the
homes of families who have typically not been engaged in research studies, which we will do at three distinct
times over the 18-30-month window of development. Participants include 132 18-month-old toddlers with
autism who screen as having no words at study start. Our outcome will be the total number of novel words on
a language sample. This study has the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of language
growth among developmentally delayed, historically underrepresented, autistic toddlers. It also addresses a
high priority need of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Council and NIH, which includes a focus on
minimally verbal, intellectually disabled children and community samples of historically marginalized and
minoritized populations."

10885153,"Pathologically, multiple sclerosis (MS) can be identified by the presence of diffuse, discrete demyelinated areas, called plaques. Demyelination is a major feature of MS and therefore, an approach to the management of MS involves an increase in remyelination of axons, resulting in clinical improvement. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β or δ (PPARβ) being highly expressed in the CNS participates in many brain functions including myelination. Being a nuclear hormone receptor, PPARβ needs ligand(s) for its activation and nuclear translocation. Therefore, identification of new nontoxic ligand of PPARβ would be very important for promoting remyelination. The β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is available in local GNC stores as a muscle-building supplement in human. It is a physiological molecule that is produced in human through the metabolism of L-leucine. HMB is known to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size and muscle strength and improve exercise performance. Here, we will test an exciting hypothesis that HMB binds to the ligand-binding domain of PPARβ (Specific aim I) and that HMB and its precursor L-leucine promote maturation of OPCs (Specific aim II) and stimulate remyelination in animal models (cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or EAE) of CNS demyelination (Specific aim III) via OPC-specific and/or microglia-specific PPARβ. To investigate whether the muscle building effects of L-leucine and HMB could contribute to improved motor function in cuprizone and EAE models, Specific aim III will also examine the role of skeletal muscle-specific PPARβ. A positive outcome of this cutting-edge R01 proposal will delineate easily available muscle-building supplement HMB as a physiological ligand of PPARβ and enhance the possibility of promoting remyelination and treating patients with MS and other demyelinating disorders with HMB and its precursor L-leucine as primary or adjunct therapy."
10886750,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
 Harnessing the immune system for the treatment of cancer through PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor has shown
considerable promise in a number of solid tumors. Recently, the use of neoadjuvant PD-1 checkpoint blockade
demonstrated prolonged overall survival in a randomized study of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. However,
outcomes remain poor for these patients, with an observed median survival of 13.2 months and most patients
succumbing to disease progression. Our group has found a novel way to overcome treatment resistance to
adjuvant αPD-1 monotherapy by employing concomitant transfer of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSC) with PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in preclinical models of CNS malignancies. We have
demonstrated that HSCs co-transferred with immunotherapy significantly increases accumulation and significant
activation of tumor-reactive T cells and tumor-associated dendritic cells (DC) within malignant glioma and
medulloblastoma. Here we will dissect the mechanisms by which HSCs simultaneously modulate multiple
pathways within the tumor microenvironment to potentiate anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models of cortical
high grade glioma (KR158B) and Group 3 molecular subtype medulloblastoma (NSC). We have recently
published that HSC + αPD-1 overcomes treatment resistance to αPD-1 in both f high grade glioma and cerebellar
medulloblastoma which are tumors with distinct genetic backgrounds and anatomic location. We believe that this
therapy has unifying mechanisms that transcends the differences in the types of malignant brain tumors and
their anatomical location in these orthotopic models. The major impact of our study is that we have discovered
a clinically applicable method of overcoming treatment resistance to αPD-1 in multiple refractory brain tumors.
Importantly, we believe that combinatorial HSC + αPD-1 dramatically reduces modulatory pathways within brain
tumors while displacing endogenous suppressor cells. This leads to the observed subsequent increases in anti-
tumor T cell activation within the tumor microenvironment. The characterization and development of a singular
intravenously-delivered immunotherapeutic that can target multiple immune regulatory pathways within several
distinct brain tumors is highly significant and clinically relevant. Our HYPOTHESIS is that HSCs overcome
treatment resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade through altering the cell fate differentiation of multi-lineage
cellular compartments within the tumor microenvironment. Towards this end, the AIMS of this project are to: AIM
1. Determine the mechanism by which HSC + αPD-1 potentiate immune activation within the tumor
microenvironment; AIM 2. Identify pathways that allow escape from HSC + αPD-1 therapy; AIM 3. Determine
strategies to enhance the efficacy of HSC + αPD-1."
10886754,"The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the functions of mammalian H1 linker histones in gene regulation
and chromatin activity during the cell cycle and to reveal functional differences amongst the 11 variants that
constitute the mammalian H1 gene family. Along with the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) that
assemble DNA into nucleosomes, the H1 linker histones play key roles in organizing the structure of the
chromatin fiber. In comparison to the progress in understanding the roles of core histones, our knowledge about
the functions of linker histones in chromatin biology is quite limited. Much of our knowledge about H1’s roles is
derived from in vitro studies, whereas our understanding of its functions in vivo remains very incomplete. We
propose to help fill this gap by elucidating the functions, mechanisms of action and variant-specific activities of
mammalian H1 linker histones in gene regulation and chromatin activity in vivo.
 Our strategy for studying the in vivo functions of mammalian H1’s has been to generate and characterize
mouse embryonic stem cells and mice that are partially depleted of H1 by inactivation of several H1 genes. By
analyzing these H1-depleted models, we showed that H1 is essential for mammalian development, plays
unexpected roles in epigenetic regulation, and is very important for the integrity and silencing of heterochromatin.
Furthermore, our studies with Drosophila H1 showed that it is required for late replication of heterochromatin
during endoreplication of salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Recently, we also discovered that, in addition
to their important functions in heterochromatin, mammalian H1’s also play important roles in euchromatin where
they inhibit deposition of active gene body chromatin marks (methylation of H3K79, H3K36 and H3K4) and affect
Pol II transcription elongation and alternative mRNA splicing outcomes.
 To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which mammalian H1’s participate in gene regulation
and chromatin activities, we propose to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Understand the functions of H1 in
RNA Pol II transcription, mRNA splicing and gene body histone H3 lysine methylation; (2) Determine the roles
of H1 in late S phase replication timing of heterochromatin and its reorganization during the mitosis to G1 phase
transition; (3) Identify functional differences amongst H1 variants and the contributions of their N- and C-terminal
domains and post-translational modifications.
 The successful completion of this project will provide important insights into the ways in which this major
constituent of chromatin regulates the structure and activity of mammalian chromosomes."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic disease that progresses through a lengthy asymptomatic period 
before entering a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Using current biomarker 
tools, we can determine with a fair degree of confidence whether or not AD-related pathology is present 
in a living individual. However, there remain major limitations in the capabilities of AD biomarkers, and 
there is a critical need for new biomarkers to overcome remaining barriers. The proposed Biomarker 
Core will support research activities in the Emory ADRC by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Perform 
and analyze standardized genetic profiling and explore promising candidates; 2) Perform and analyze 
standardized CSF AD biomarker assays and explore promising candidates; 3) Perform and analyze 
standard brain imaging and evaluate promising additional sequences. The proposed Biomarker Core 
will provide a number of important enhancements to the research environment. Longitudinal collection 
of common datasets, including clinical information, CSF AD biomarkers, core genetic information, and 
standard brain MRI sequences, will provide foundations upon which new AD biomarkers can be tested, 
evaluated, and confirmed. Exploratory research in each of these areas should provide significant 
advances in CSF proteomics, new MR sequences, and genomic data. Lastly, the current proposal 
engages a group of talented investigators who will bring their expertise to the ADRC and the larger 
research community. Each of these elements advance the overall goals of the ADRC and will provide a 
wealth of data for new trainees."

proportion of CSUSM students is Hispanic (47%), which exceeds the non-Hispanic White
population (27%). The campus is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). In addition, 54%
are from families in which they will be the first to complete a college degree and 52% are
Pell Grant recipients. Thus, CSUSM is home to a rapidly growing diverse student body,
many of whom are low income and/or the first in their family to attend college.
The Bridges to the Doctorate Research Training Program at CSU San Marcos with

scientific communication skills, 4) engage students in meaningful biomedical research
that results in thesis and publication(s), 5) develop knowledge, skills and persistence
necessary to succeedin a doctoral program and beyond, 6) expose students to a
culturally validated pedagogy to increase belonging and persistence, 7) to prepare
competitive applications for graduate school, and 8) reduce time to degree in both
Master’s and PhD settings. The program is two years in length. We propose to engage 8
master’s students in year 1 of the program, and 16 in years 2-5.
Our major goals, informed by past success rates, are for 90% of CSUSM B2PhD Scholars
to graduate with their master’s degree and 70% to enter PhD programs. Taken as a whole,
the B2PhD Program, in concert with a highly supportive campus environment, will prepare
students from UR groups to be thoughtful scientists who have the knowledge, skills, research
experience and character that prepare them for doctoral studies in the biomedical and
behavioral sciences and that allow them to become future leaders in science and academia. By
doing this we will help advance the goals of the National Institutes of Health to diversify the
research workforce. A more diverse research workforce will better address the research needs
of a diverse nation and thereby contribute to better health for all."
10888360,"Exposure to pesticides, fungicides and herbicides is linked to neuronal injury, neuronal loss and the onset and progress of
neurodegeneration. Environmental and household use of pesticides such as rotenone, Maneb, paraquat, Cyprodinil, etc
initiates mitochondrial dysfunction. The resulting elevation in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
species (RNS) triggers ubiquitin-proteasome (UPS) dysregulation, alters cellular-proteomics’ status and the provokes the
aggregation of amyloid proteins in neurons. Aggregation-prone amyloids such as alpha-synuclein, amyloid β, and mutant
Huntingtin protein (mHTT) form toxic oligomers and protofibrils that create pores in cell membranes, disrupt Ca2+
homeostasis, facilitate neurotransmitter leakage and provoke neuronal death, on-setting neurodegenerative disorders such
as Parkinson’s (PD), Alzheimer’s (AD) and Huntington’s (HD) diseases. Efforts at limiting environmental toxicant-driven
neurodegenerative onset with small molecules have enjoyed limited success. Here, we explore whether a novel class of
carbon nano materials, viz. carbon quantum dots (CQDs), can restore cellular homeostasis and prevent behavioral deficits
in organisms under pesticide exposure. CQDs are easily synthesized from biowaste-containing carbon precursors such as
fruit peel, waste paper and organic acids via green-chemical techniques. They possess low cytotoxicity and are inherently
antioxidant. Importantly, they can be chemically functionalized and doped. When chemically tuned, they find applications
in biosensing, tissue imaging, drug-delivery and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Preliminary data from our lab has revealed
that organo-acid-derived CQDs can interfere in amyloid aggregation and mitigate ROS-stress in cells. They were uptaken
by nematodes and protected them from paraquat toxicity. We hypothesize that CQDs ameliorate environmental toxicant-
associated neuronal corruption. We test this hypothesis in Aim 1, by determining whether CQDs can intervene in amyloid
fibril-forming trajectories. We also attempt to extend our understanding of how functionalized CQDs interact with toxic
intermediates such as oligomers and protofibrils to passivate them. In Aim 2, using a number of proteomic and
neurometabolomic readouts, we establish whether functionalized CQDs can reset pesticide-driven cellular dyshomeostasis
in model neuroblastoma-derived cells. In Aim 3, we will test their ability to restore neuronal loss and behavioral deficits in
C. elegans using strains prone to amyloidogenesis and/or via pesticide-exposure. In the former scenario, worms strains
expressing mHTT, amyloid β or alpha-synuclein will be exposed to CQDs while the latter objective is completed by introducing
CQDs into pesticide-challenged worms. By quantitatively co-relating amyloid aggregation and locomotor compromise with
CQD-type and dose, we will test our hypothesis at the organismal level. Findings from the completion of the proposed work
will define the ability of green-chemistry-derived CQDs to attenuate pesticide-associated neuronal corruption. CQDs are
likely to translate to preclinical trials involving vertebrate (rodent) models of neurotoxic insult."
10888157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Changes in placental structure and function not only cause serious pregnancy complications but also
determine life-long health by programming the fetus for future metabolic and cardiovascular disease.
Unfortunately, the mechanisms linking altered placental function to poor short- and long-term outcomes are
complex and remain largely unknown. To better understand placental biology and pathophysiology, a
multidisciplinary approach utilizing a wide array of cutting edge technologies is required. Progress in this area
is hampered by the paucity of scientific meetings focused on placental biology. The primary objective of this
R13 grant proposal is to meet the urgent need of a multidisciplinary, interactive forum for dissemination of
novel concepts and exchange of ideas in placental research by featuring exceptional speakers working in
cutting-edge areas of research. The secondary objective is to provide a low cost, high-quality learning
environment, in the area of placental biology, which will encourage attendance and active participation by a
diverse group of in training and early investigators. In our conference plan we seek support for an annual one-
day conference as a satellite meeting the day before the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society of
Reproductive Investigation (SRI). By this design we will maximize the impact of the meeting and will allow for
attendance of a diverse group of basic scientists and clinical investigators ranging from graduate students to
well established researchers. The meeting will allow ample time for interaction, informal discussion and
networking and is anticipated to attract 130-150 attendees each year. The program will have a balanced mix of
“state of the art” lectures presented by the leaders in the field, emerging concept presentations, and shorter
talks by trainees. All speakers will be mandated to provide ample time for questions and discussion. This
proposal is significant because the meeting is timely and will promote novel scientific inquiry into placental
biology, which is expected to pave the way for future innovation to develop approaches to monitor placental
function in vivo and to target the placenta for intervention. The proposal includes numerous innovative
aspects. For example, we propose to facilitate the utilization and adaptation of emerging concepts from other
research fields by inviting one speaker each year that works in a research area other than placental biology. To
provide ample opportunities for early career investigators to connect, discuss, and interact with the speakers
we propose to organize the conference lunch so that in training investigators will have direct access to
speakers in a small group. The proposed meeting is expected to have significant and sustained impact on the
field because it is unique in bringing together world-leading investigators representing diverse but
complementary expertise in a creative and interactive forum, which is necessary to address the complex
scientific questions pertaining to the role of placenta in determining health and disease from fetal life to
adulthood."
10889351,"Project summary/Abstract
Skeletal muscle has a remarkable regenerative capability when the extent of the injury is relatively minor.
However, following traumatic muscle injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML), the endogenous repair
potential of skeletal muscle becomes inadequate, which causes physical disability and adversely influences the
quality of life. Biomaterial scaffolds hold great promise for improving the functional recovery of skeletal muscle
by providing both physical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation. Particularly, acellular scaffolds are promising and clinically transformative as they obviate
limitations associated with using exogenous cells, including limited sources and immunogenicity. However,
existing acellular bioscaffolds have failed to induce the formation of a sufficient amount of de novo myofibers
and achieve appreciable muscle functional improvement, limitations that have been largely attributed to the poor
ability of acellular scaffolds to recruit endogenous cells, especially muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Therefore,
developing an acellular scaffold capable of active cell recruitment represents a major technological advance in
the treatment of VML. Inspired by the native tissues such as skin that generate electrical signals to guide cell
migration during injury repair, we propose to develop a biodegradable piezoelectric scaffold comprised of a fibrin-
based hydrogel containing boron nitride nanotubes (fibrin/BNNTs). Our scaffold is designed to convert
mechanical stimuli (e.g., via ultrasound and exercise-induced muscle contraction) to electrical signals with the
goal of promoting cell recruitment. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that, upon ultrasound
stimulation, fibrin/BNNTs piezoelectric scaffolds enhance endogenous cell recruitment and MuSC differentiation,
thus accelerating the functional recovery of skeletal muscle after VML. Two specific aims are proposed to test
our central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 studies will optimize the fibrin/BNNTs scaffold composition and ultrasound
stimulation to promote MuSC recruitment and myogenic differentiation in vitro using a novel 3D VML muscle
construct model. In Specific Aim 2, using our validated VML male and female mouse models, we will evaluate
the ability of ultrasound-stimulated piezoelectric scaffolds to promote in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration, and
we will evaluate whether these effects are sex-dependent. We anticipate that the successful completion of these
studies will not only offer a promising new strategy for enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration but also provide
novel insights into scaffold design for other applications, such as skin and cardiac regeneration."
10889354,"Project Summary
 Brucella spp. are bacteria that naturally infect a variety of domesticated and wild animals leading to
abortions and sterility, and these bacteria are also capable of causing debilitating human infections, which
often result from human exposure to infected animals and animal products. Brucella spp. are considered
threats as potential biological weapons. Importantly, antibiotic treatment against brucellosis is prone to disease
relapse, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine to protect humans against infection with Brucella.
The brucellae are intracellular pathogens that reside within immune cells called macrophages where they
replicate in a specialized compartment, and the capacity of Brucella to survive and replicate within
macrophages is essential to their ability to cause disease. Interestingly, quorum sensing is an important
component of Brucella virulence, but traditionally, quorum sensing is an activity performed by large populations
of bacteria, while the brucellae exists primarily in intracellular vacuoles in small numbers. Thus, the Brucella
quorum sensing system is atypical to the paradigm of Gram-negative quorum sensing systems, and this
application seeks to define novels elements of this pathway.
 Preliminary work in our group led to the development of a B. abortus strain that is unable to sense the
quorum sensing molecule, acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Deletion of the two genes encoding transcriptional
regulators of the LuxR family yielded a quorum sensing “deaf” strain, and this strain will be used to define the
Brucella quorum sensing transcriptome in order to identify genetic elements critical to virulence. Additionally,
we will test the hypothesis that the quorum sensing “deaf” strain will be highly attenuated in both cellular and
animal models of Brucella infection. Finally, it is known that Brucella strains produce a 12 carbon AHL, but no
genes are present that encode known AHL synthases. As such, we have developed an unbiased screening
strategy to identify the Brucella AHL synthase. In the end, the information gleaned from these studies may be
used to develop new therapeutic and vaccine strategies against human Brucella infection."
10889353,"The majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk is genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified 75 AD-associated SNPs. In other fields, pharmacologic agents targeting proteins identified
through genetics have produced striking success. However, the AD field has lagged, partly because we have
struggled to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby genetic variants impact AD. This proposal focuses on
the phospholipase PLCG2, which was initially associated with AD through a missense SNP, rs72824905
(P522R), that strikingly reduces AD risk. PLCG2 modulates microglial function by mediating signaling from
TREM2 and related receptors. P522R appears a hypermorphic mutation that increases PLCG2 function
through an unclear mechanism. However, homozygosity for P522R is apparently deleterious, suggesting that
PLCG2 activity must be tightly controlled for optimal brain aging. In considering PLCG2 genetics and AD, we
recognized that PLCG2 expression and splicing relative to AD genetics have not been scrutinized. Indeed, a
SNP upstream of PLCG2, rs12446759, was recently associated with AD risk in a GWAS; the actions of this
GWAS SNP are not clear although eQTL compendia suggest that this SNP is associated with expression of
the lncRNA RP11-960L18, some isoforms of which include PLCG2 beginning at exon 2. To address the gap
in our knowledge regarding PLCG2 expression and AD genetics, we propose to elucidate the extent that
genetics modulate PLCG2 expression and splicing, to identify the underlying mechanisms, and to identify
proof-of-concept approaches to improve PLCG2 expression to reduce AD risk. In preliminary work, we
identified a novel PLCG2 splice variant, D65-PLCG2, in human brain, quantified this isoform in AD and non-AD
brain samples, and identified a SNP, rs1071644, within the variant exon that correlates with expression of this
novel isoform. Remarkably, rs1071644 is associated with increased AD risk (p=9x10-8). Rs1071644 appears
to be a novel AD risk factor because this SNP is not co-inherited with either the GWAS SNP, rs12446759 or
P522R according to LDpair. In summary, our global hypothesis is that genetic variants impact PLCG2 splicing
and/or expression to alter PLCG2 function and thereby modulate AD risk. To explore this hypothesis, we
propose these Specific Aims: 1: Identify and quantify PLCG2 isoforms expressed in human brain as a
function of AD neuropathology and genetics. 2: Compare PLCG2 and D65-PLCG2 protein expression
and function. 3: Translate PLCG2 splicing genetics to identify modulators predicted to reduce AD risk.
Successful completion of these studies will reveal rs1071644 as a novel AD risk factor that acts via PLCG2
splicing, show that the AD GWAS SNP rs12446759 alters expression of a novel RP11-960L18_PLCG2
isoform, test whether the D65-PLCG2 represents a gain or loss of function, and begin to translate these
findings to pharmacologic modulation. By defining the extent that genetics regulate PLCG2 expression to alter
AD risk, these results will inform drug development targeting this pathway."
10889355,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The neglect of children and adolescents, a form of maltreatment along with abuse, is a significant problem
that impairs health and well-being throughout the lifespan. The long-term goal of this
exploratory/developmental research grant (R21) is to lay the groundwork for a larger research grant (R01) to
examine the multilevel antecedents of adolescent neglect, information that is critical to the development of
interventions. The objective is to conceptualize, develop and initially validate a multidimensional youth self-
reported measure of adolescent neglect. Neglect is conceptualized as inadequately met adolescent needs that
present actual or potential harm. This shifts from previous definitions which have focused on parental
omissions in care. This adolescent-centered conceptualization helps reconcile neglect's definition with growing
scientific evidence of its complex multilevel etiology. By untangling unmet needs from parental omissions, the
adolescent-centered conceptualization allows for more rigorous research examining neglect's multilevel
antecedents. Importantly, it offers a more constructive frame that should improve parent and youth
engagement in intervention. Aim 1 is to conceptualize, develop and pilot test a youth self-report measure of
adolescent neglect, defining it as critical unmet adolescent needs. It will apply rigorous qualitative methods per
state-of-the-art Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scientific standards
for establishing content validity. Guided by an initial conceptual framework, this will include a scoping literature
review, a two-round modified Delphi expert panel (N = 12) and cognitive and concept elicitation interviews with
adolescents (N = 18). The second aim is to establish initial psychometric properties of the new neglect
measure. We will explore the measure's dimensional structure and assess its reliability (internal consistency,
test-retest), validity (criterion, concurrent and predictive convergent), and invariance in a sample of 12-17-year-
olds in Philadelphia who are at risk for neglect (N = 400). The outcome of the proposed research will be a
rigorously developed, novel measure of adolescent neglect with a sound conceptualization that incorporates
input from diverse experts and youths (Aim 1) and evidence of psychometric properties (Aim 2). The measure
has the potential for significant impact, paving the way for a new generation of neglect scholarship with a
sound conceptual and operational basis that will illuminate the scope, multi-level contributors, and sequelae of
adolescent neglect, informing policy and intervention that can overcome this intractable and pernicious
problem."

patient experience of maternity care. Under the team’s close guidance, Dr. Garrett will gain proposed skills and
knowledge via coursework, mentored tutorials, and practical experience.
 Hospitals are well-positioned to advance birth equity, but there is inadequate evidence to guide them. Dr.
Garrett proposes to use stakeholder guidance, implementation science, and antiracist frameworks to investigate
California hospitals' health equity-promoting intervention efforts. Focusing on interventions intended to decrease
racial/ethnic inequities in maternal care quality and outcomes, she will: Aim 1) Characterize how a diverse set
of California hospitals are working to reduce maternal health inequities; Aim 2) Identify drivers of equity-focused
practice change in facilities participating in a collaborative program; and Aim 3) Generate actionable community-
led guidance for hospitals’ birth equity intervention work. This implementation-focused K01 will provide
evidence- and community-based guidance for facilities’ selection and implementation of maternal health equity
interventions. It will form the basis of an R01 to examine how health equity interventions affect patient outcomes
(clinical, experiential) in diverse hospital settings across the country."
10887717,"Therapeutic Targeting in EGFR-amplified Glioblastoma
 Glioblastomas (GBM) are common and the most malignant adult tumors in the central nervous
system with a poor prognosis. Among IDH wild type (WT) GBM under the new 2021 WHO classification,
>55% tumors have EGFR amplification and/or mutations which is an established oncogenic driver of GBM
malignancy and has served as a biomarker and therapeutic target of high interest. However, EGFR-
targeting therapies remain ineffective, clinically, for GBM treatment. The failures of targeting EGFR are
largely attributed to GBM tumor heterogeneity with intertwined oncogenic signaling, dynamic switching
between tumor subtypes, and an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. While the canonical
downstream signaling of EGFR is well understood, other non-canonical pathways remain to be discovered
in order to take advantage of this prevalent oncogenic driver as a therapeutic target in GBM. The goal of
this project is to explore new therapeutic approaches for EGFR-amplified GBM by assessing the role of a
largely uncharacterized gene that is co-amplified with EGFR in GBM, EGFR long non-coding downstream
RNA (ELDR). ELDR is the most up-regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in EGFR-amplified GBM
where ELDR expression augments the tumorigenicity of GBM cells and does so independently of EGFR
signaling. ELDR binds to the purine-rich element-binding protein alpha (PURA) that is tumor suppressive
in GBM. ELDR-PURA binding prevents PURA from interacting with the proto-oncogene BMI1, thus
disrupting the PURA-BMI1 association in GSCs, and in so doing should increase BMI1/PRC1 oncogenic
activity. Importantly, nuclear ELDR is found enriched in the nuclear speckles (NS), a membrane-less
subcellular structure and a biomolecular condensate critical in cancer progression and chemoresistance,
and interacts with multiple proteins in the nucleus, mostly in NS, thus simultaneously modulating different
signaling and cellular processes. In this project, we plan to determine how the ELDR-PURA association
affects GBM biologic properties through affecting PURA-BMI1 interaction thereby regulating BMI1 activity,
assess effects of NS-enriched ELDR on GBM biologic properties, and determine whether specific targeting
of ELDR using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), instead of inhibiting individual ELDR-effectors, enhances
therapeutic responses of GBM. This project will be the first to study a consequence of the EGFR locus
amplification in GBM through ELDR in GBM biology and therapeutic response. The results of this study
will not only advance our understanding of the importance of lncRNA expression in cancer, which has the
potential to influence global gene expression in normal and tumor cells, but also open the door to an
alternative strategy of targeting the well-characterized amplification of the EGFR locus in GBM."

10885968,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RESEARCH PROJECT: PATHOLOGIC SIGNIFICANCE OF MATERNAL
AUTOANTIBODIES
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1 in 59 children in the United States, yet there remains relatively
little understanding of underlying cause(s) and few options for therapeutic interventions. Our research team is
evaluating an immune-based mechanism implicated in ASD – prenatal exposure to maternal autoantibodies that
target proteins in the developing fetal brain. A significant subset of mothers who have a child with ASD produce
antibodies to fetal brain proteins that are critical for neurodevelopment. We hypothesize that these antibodies
cross the placenta during gestation, interact with fetal brain protein targets, alter neurodevelopment, and lead to
a maternal autoantibody (AB) related (MAR) form of ASD. We have found that up to 26% of cases are associated
with MAR. Previous preclinical studies have used mice and nonhuman primates to evaluate the pathogenic
importance of MAR exposure. In these model systems, offspring born to dams periodically injected with MAR
AB during gestation exhibit atypical neurodevelopment and behavior. While these passive transfer models
provide support for MAR as a risk factor for ASD, they do not reflect the constant exposure that occurs throughout
gestation experienced by the human fetus. Our research team has recently validated a highly accurate test for
MAR AB, and established the next generation of more sophisticated antigen-driven models, which together will
allow us to evaluate the pathogenic significance of continuous exposure to specific combinations of MAR AB.
We are now positioned to utilize the sophisticated social and cognitive processing capabilities and complex
neuroanatomy of the rat model system to evaluate the pathogenic significance of prenatal MAR exposure. Here
we propose an exploratory, discovery-based, research project that will utilize multiple MIND Institute IDDRC
Cores to test the hypothesis that continuous gestational exposure to specific combinations of MAR AB is causally
linked to changes in brain and behavioral development of the offspring. Through human clinical studies, we will
first determine the association between the MAR ASD AB patterns and neurodevelopmental profiles among the
children with ASD from human samples collected prospectively during pregnancy from high-risk mothers (Aim
1). We will then leverage these clinically relevant data to directly assess the pathologic significance of prenatal
exposure to epitope-specific AB in generating ASD-relevant behaviors in the antigen-driven rat model (Aim 2).
Data derived from Aim 2 will indicate which of the individual ABs are pathologically significant, and which are
biomarkers of risk with no pathologic relevance. In this model, the embryos will be continuously exposed to the
MAR ABs throughout gestation, thereby better representing the human MAR ASD environment and providing
an experimental model system to determine downstream molecular pathways (Aim 3). This high-risk, potentially
high-reward, proposal is an essential next step in developing novel therapeutics and strategies for prevention."

10886761,"SUMMARY
The increasing frequency and severity of Ebola outbreaks demands an expanded repertoire of treatments and
preventative measures. Answering this unmet need will require a deeper understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying filovirus replication. In particular, the dynamic events that occur during filovirus envelope
glycoprotein (GP)-mediated membrane fusion during entry into cells have evaded elucidation for decades.
Previous studies have identified proteolytic cleavage of GP, receptor binding, and the chemical environment of
the late endosome as being critical. But the molecular mechanisms by which these events and variables promote
GP-mediated membrane fusion are not known. As a result, a complete and specific model of filovirus fusion,
which integrates host factors, environmental conditions, and GP conformational changes currently does not exist.
Therefore, filovirus entry continues to be an unutilized target for inhibitors. Our long-term goal is to develop a
complete mechanistic model of GP-mediated membrane fusion. Our recent publications, in which we
demonstrate the power of single-molecule fluorescence methods in elucidating the conformational dynamics of
EBOV GP on the surface of virions, demonstrate our initial efforts toward this end. Here we aim to build on this
success by proposing a multidisciplinary study involving virological, cellular, structural, and biophysical
methodologies to elucidate the dynamics and mechanisms of GPs from multiple filoviruses. We will characterize
the mechanisms by which conformational changes, host factors, and environmental variables facilitate filovirus
membrane fusion and entry into cells. Completion of the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into
filovirus entry and the viral and host targets that could be exploited with novel therapies and immunogens."
10886699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease, affecting more than 27 million people in the United States
alone. This large affected population and the severe consequent debility of OA lead to significant expenses to
the health care system. OA is characterized by biochemical, structural and morphologic degradation of
components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage. The ECM is composed of primarily two
groups of macromolecules including proteoglycan (PG) and collagen fibers. Early diagnosis of cartilage
degeneration would require the ability to non-invasively detect changes in PG concentration and collagen
integrity before morphological changes occur. T1ρ and T2 relaxation times are affected by these pathological
processes and are the most widely used biochemical cartilage MRI sequences worldwide. .
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate high spatial resolution 3D-isotropic-
MRI sequence (700µmX700µmX700µm) for simultaneous assessment of morphometry and biexponential 3D-
T1ρ (T2) mapping sequences (each protocol under 10 minutes) for improved quantitative assessment of
morphological (cartilage thickness and volume) and biochemical characterization of cartilage on a standard
clinical 3T scanner employing combinations of compressed sensing (CS) and parallel imaging (PI). The
proposed accelerated, isotropic, high spatial resolution, multicomponent 3D-T1ρ (T2) mapping techniques can
be easily incorporated into routine clinical protocols for biochemical assessment of cartilage in addition to
standard morphological evaluation and could serve as future imaging biomarkers for disease modifying
therapies for OA. The outcome of this proposed study will significantly impact our ability for personalized
treatment regimens and possibly prevent the development of premature OA."
10886701,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen of high biomedical significance against which we lack effective
countermeasures. Although targeted chemotherapy using combinations of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has
proven highly successful against hepatitis C virus infection and HIV, efforts to develop analogous drugs against
DENV have not been successful. The genetic diversity of DENV due to replication by an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase that lacks proofreading function presents additional challenges by making it difficult to develop
vaccines and antivirals with broad-spectrum coverage of all genotypes within one viral species and facilitating
the rapid development of antiviral resistance when DAAs are used as monotherapies.
 Recently developed methods for small molecule-induced degradation of specific proteins rely on chimeric
molecules (“PROTACs,” “degronimids,” “degraders”) that have a target-specific ligand linked to a moiety that
binds an E3 ubiquitin ligase (e.g., cereblon, VHL). Small molecule-binding leads to ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of the target. This results in event-driven rather than occupancy-driven pharmacology
leading to efficient removal of the target from the cell and functional ablation of all of the protein's functions.
Since pharmacological activity does not require constant, stoichiometric engagement of the target, even modest
affinity ligands can be effective degraders. In addition, this mechanism of action can have higher natural barriers
to resistance than conventional inhibitors, as has been demonstrated in the cancer biology field. While these
potential advantages are attractive for antivirals development, it remains unclear the extent to which they can be
leveraged to attain significant antiviral effects. In particular, strong viral expression and localization of viral
processes (and their effectors) on or near specialized membranes may limit the susceptibility of DENV and other
viruses to this pharmacological strategy. Here we propose to explore whether we can successfully deploy
targeted protein degradation against three essential DENV proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5. As there are
currently no approved anti-DENV drugs, there is an urgent need to find new pharmacological strategies to target
this virus. Starting with known inhibitors as targeting ligands for degrader development, we will develop and
validate antiviral degraders. We will then use these as tools to systematically explore potential points of
differentiation between degraders and conventional inhibitors in terms of affinity, potency, selectivity, duration of
action and susceptibility to resistance. We will also optimize validated antiviral degraders to test the efficacy of
this antiviral approach in vivo. The overall goal is to validate degradation of one or more of these targets as an
antiviral strategy with high natural barrier to resistance and to advance first-in-class degraders as leads for the
development of antivirals. In pursuit of this goal, we will also establish important proof of concept and the
foundation for more broadly developing antiviral degraders against other viral pathogens."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Cytoscape is an open source software platform for biological network analysis, visualization and modeling. It is
a critical bioinformatics resource in academia and industry, with 300,000+ downloads per year and 25,000+
citations. The widespread adoption of Cytoscape is due mainly to its utility in diverse biological analyses, its
sustainable open development model, and its extensible architecture, which enables anyone to add algorithmic
functionality and has attracted hundreds of third-party developers.
Access to network analysis tools is particularly important now, at a time when network knowledge and
concepts are increasingly central to genomics research. Cytoscape is in an excellent position to address this
need and serve as a hub for knowledge-based genome analysis. In this application to support Cytoscape as a
U24 Genomic Community Resource, we will work towards four specific aims. First, we will maintain our
longtime substantial commitment to produce Cytoscape software as a critical research resource. Second, we
will complete our ongoing development of Cytoscape as an ecosystem of tools and services on the web, so
that key network biology tools are more accessible to biomedical researchers and can readily access big
biomedical datasets and interoperate in cloud computing environments. Immediate targets of these
developments will be resources in which federal organizations are already making substantial investments,
including AnVIL, BioData Catalyst and Cancer Genomic Data Commons. Third, we will work collaboratively
with outside tool developers to promote a constellation of leading tools for network-based genomic analysis,
including both existing and nascent approaches emerging from the data science community. Finally, we will
continue to offer a rich set of Cytoscape training programs, including new material that actively guides users
through analysis workflows, updating content based on input they provide.
In summary, these activities will support not only production of the Cytoscape resource– they will create a next
generation desktop, web and cloud-based ecosystem for using knowledge networks in genomic data science."
10886576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid use, dependence, and addiction have dramatically increased to epidemic proportions in recent years,
leading to substantial financial and societal health burdens, as well as an increasing number of overdoses. To
combat this epidemic, it is imperative that we understand the neurobiological underpinnings that lead to opioid
use disorder. We must identify disrupted neuron subtypes in the brain in opioid use disorders and dysregulated
molecules within these neurons that underlie cellular, circuit, and ultimately behavioral adaptations. Use of rat
drug self-administration (SA) and relapse assays, which are considered the best available animal models of
addiction, will allow a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the genomic,
epigenetic, and transcriptional-induced cellular plasticity that drives the long-lasting drug seeking and propensity
for heroin relapse.
We will perform genome-wide transcriptome and open-chromatin profiling of ventral pallidum (VP) projection
neuron subtypes in rat heroin SA, both acutely following drug cessation and after prolonged periods of drug
abstinence. Here, we focus on the VP as a critical node in the brain’s reward circuit. Our studies will profile VP
neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, medial dorsal thalamus, and lateral
habenula. We will then integrate the transcriptomic and epigenomic data with complementary transcriptomic and
epigenomic datasets, including multimodal data from the BRAIN Initiative describing cell type diversity in the VP
and its output circuits. We will reconstruct cell type-specific gene co-expression and open chromatin networks
and identify hub genes predicted to have central roles in immediate and prolonged abstinence from heroin, which
could underlie subsequent relapse behavior. This collection of datasets and models will be made available
through a biologist-friendly web portal based on our BRAIN Initiative-funded Neuroscience Multi-Omic Analytics
platform.
Using the data generated we will develop rat gene loci-specific CRISPR epigenomic targeting tools to determine
the functional significance of key hub genes that are regulated in VP projection neuron subtypes. To achieve this
goal, we will employ rat models of relapse in combination with advanced CRISPRa and CRISPRi AAV tools to
enhance or reduce transcription of key hub genes during heroin SA or abstinence from heroin SA followed by
cue-induced reinstatement. The studies proposed in this grant application will, for the first time, identify the
distinct heroin-induced gene network adaptations occurring temporally in a cell-type-specific manner within a
novel neurobiological circuit."
10886817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multi-organ
inflammation, resulting from loss of tolerance to self-antigens and production of anti-nuclear antibodies by
activated, autoreactive B cells. To date, the exact etiology of SLE has not been well characterized. There is no
cure for SLE and current treatments focus on controlling symptoms and minimizing flare-ups. Identification of
new targets for therapy could greatly improve the therapeutic landscape for a disease for which little progress
has been made in decades.
In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic risk factors for
SLE. Interestingly, most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through GWAS reside in non-coding
regions, with some found in the poorly understood regulatory elements known as long-noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs). Our lab has significant experience in identifying and characterizing lncRNAs associated with human
inflammatory diseases, and in the current study, we propose to characterize a novel SLE-associated lncRNA,
that we have named as lnc12. Our preliminary studies have shown that lnc12 is highly expressed in germinal
center B cells and appears to regulate a subset of genes known to be dysregulated during SLE progression. As
determined by GWAS, lnc12 overlaps with a haplotype block of SNPs associated with SLE, including a highly
associated SNP, rs4917014, which has been linked to susceptibility, cytokine levels, and clinical features in SLE.
The rs4917014 SNP has been studied by other groups for potential effects on a neighboring gene, Ikaros family
zinc finger 1(IKZF1), which encodes the critical B cell transcription factor, Ikaros. Increased expression of IKZF1
has been reported in patients with SLE, and interestingly, we have observed that lnc12 can bind to the gene
promoter and 3’UTR of IKZF1, as well as members of the transcription machinery and spliceosome complex.
We hypothesize that lnc12 regulates gene expression in B cells through its effects on IKZF1, and that changes
in lnc12 expression, e.g. due to the SLE-associated rs4917014 SNP, may dysregulate IKZF1 expression and
contribute to SLE pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will probe the molecular mechanisms by which human lnc12 affects
IKZF1 activity. In Aim 2, we will examine the physiological roles of lnc12 in B cell development and activation in
vivo in a mouse model of SLE."
10886834,"SUMMARY - Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness affecting more than 60 million people worldwide.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma and
results from increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow. IOP reduction has been shown to reduce the risk
of conversion to glaucoma in eyes with ocular hypertension and reduce the risk of disease worsening in eyes
with existing glaucoma damage. While IOP-lowering therapies capable of restoring structure and function of the
diseased tissues that increase outflow resistance are particularly desirable, few such therapies currently exist.
These diseased tissues reside in the conventional outflow tract that is comprised of the trabecular meshwork
(TM) and Schlemm’s canal (SC). In 2013, our group discovered that reduced activity of the Angiopoietin (Angpt)-
TEK vascular signaling pathway results in a severe form of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in mice due to
failure of the SC to form. During the last grant cycle, we showed that the Angiopoietin1 ligand is expressed in
the TM and is required to activate the Tie2/TEK receptor in the SC and that severity of glaucoma disease
phenotype correlates tightly with the dose of Angpt/TEK signal strength. We were able to rescue the PCG
disease phenotype in mice, by inhibiting the vascular-specific phosphatase PTPRB, thereby boosting TEK signal
strength in a ligand-independent manner. In collaboration with an international team, we have now identified 20
unique loss-of-function mutations in the TEK and ANGPT1 genes in 20 individuals, providing a new genetic
cause of PCG and confirming the importance of this pathway in human disease. In adult patients with primary
open angle glaucoma (POAG), risk variants in the Angpt/TEK pathway have been identified and a pepti-body
targeting Angiopioetin ligands causes rapid onset of high pressure OAG in adult monkeys by reducing outflow
facility, extending importance of this pathway beyond childhood glaucoma. Altogether, our findings, largely
funded by the first cycle of this grant, have led to major new insights into the pathogenesis of glaucoma and
development of the outflow tract and have led directly to the identification of a new genetic cause of glaucoma.
In this competitive renewal, we propose to leverage these seminal discoveries to:1) fully characterize the cellular
basis of Angpt-TEK signaling in development of the outflow tract and pathogenesis of glaucoma through single
cell analysis 2) functionally annotate 2 new disease genes identified in patients with PCG and POAG and
determine how they modulate Angpt/TEK signal strength and 3) test the ability of a novel ANGPT1-mimetic to
repair defective SC and TM in glaucoma models and enhance outflow facility. By the end of the next cycle, we
will have characterized specific cell populations in the TM and SC, identified new genes responsible for glaucoma
and provide lead compounds to take forward to clinical development."

10932434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macrophages underlie the progression of inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, autoimmune
diseases, chronic wounds and cancer. Metabolic rewiring of activated macrophages to alter their function has
become an attractive therapeutic strategy, however in vivo evidence is lacking to support its therapeutic potential.
The research proposed here will address the metabolic regulation of macrophage effector function in
physiologically relevant settings by fluorescence lifetime imaging of metabolic coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD,
using zebrafish as an in vivo model of inflammation and wound healing. Importantly, this non-invasive imaging
modality measures intracellular metabolic state while maintaining macrophages in their native microenvironment,
unlike traditional approaches. This study will monitor changes in the metabolic profile of macrophages at various
wound models over time, and test the functional requirement of metabolic regulators, Irg1, Stat3 and
mitochondrial ROS, in macrophage-dependent wound healing. Metabolomics analysis will also be performed
using wounded tissue to gain further mechanistic insight into the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages in
vivo. Collectively, this study will develop imaging-based tools to probe in real time the temporal and spatial
metabolic regulation of immune cell functions in live animals that can inform development of new therapies to
mitigate macrophage-mediated inflammation.
The proposed study in this career development award application will be conducted under the primary
mentorship of Dr. Anna Huttenlocher and the co-mentorship of Dr. Melissa Skala during the K99 phase of the
award. The Huttenlocher lab at UW-Madison is an ideal environment for these studies due to the leading
expertise in leukocyte biology in inflammation and wound healing, as well as live imaging strategies in zebrafish
embryos. Dr. Skala is a leader in developing autofluorescence lifetime imaging of metabolic coenzymes and its
applications. I will benefit immensely from the mentorship of Drs. Huttenlocher and Skala, and will bridge the
expertise of both mentors toward elucidating the mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming of macrophages in
complex in vivo environments. I am committed to a career as an independent investigator at an academic
institution studying leukocyte biology; in particular, studying the metabolic regulation of leukocyte effector
functions in context of inflammatory disorders. In addition to the already excellent resources I am afforded by my
mentors, UW-Madison provides a wealth of other scientific and career development opportunities to support my
academic growth. Moreover, I am actively involved with the metabolic community at the Morgridge Institute for
Research, located on UW-Madison campus, to further enhance my training in immunometabolism. Taken
together, my mentors and UW-Madison provide an ideal environment to fully support my scientific pursuits and
ensure that I achieve my long term career goals."
10890605,"Role of the Epitranscriptome in Cancer
More than 600,000 Americans will die this year from cancer. One limitation in treating this devastating
disease is the lack of “druggable” targets for therapeutic intervention. Over the last thirty years much work
has been done on understanding how epigenetic changes including DNA methylation, and histone
modifications influence gene expression and contribute to cancer, and drugs targeting certain DNA or
histone methyltransferases are used in the clinic. It is emerging that mammalian messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) are also subject to various posttranscriptional modifications including methylation but the
relevance of this pathway in cancer has not yet been examined. The ambitious goal of this pioneering
proposal is to explore the relevance of mRNA methylation in cancer and to establish the “epitranscriptome”
as a new and effective cancer therapeutic target. To accomplish this we will map the epitranscriptome in a
panel of primary human lung- and colon adenocarcinomas as well as matched normal tissues, explore the
mechanism and function of altered mRNA methylation in human cancer cells and mouse cancer models,
and perform high-throughput screening to identify small molecules that can specifically inhibit certain mRNA
methyltransferases. The molecules we identify will be tested in cancer cells and mouse xenografts for their
ability to restore mRNA methylation as a means to suppress oncogene expression and cancer growth. This
work promises to transform the field of cancer medicine by establishing the epitranscriptome as a novel
therapeutic target and could lead to more effective treatments for lung, colon and other tumor types."

10891622,"This study proposes a longitudinal study to assess the effects of opioid prescribing practices on outcomes of
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). The research is responsive to priorities
espoused by the National Plans to Address Alzheimer’s disease: Goal 2 Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency
to address care needs of ADRD patients due to co-occurring chronic conditions. Chronic pain is common in
ADRD, with 90% of affected patients relying on pharmacotherapy, such as opioids, to relieve painful
symptoms. Use of prescription opioids in ADRD has doubled over the last decade; among users, over half
used opioids chronically or concurrently with other central-nervous-system (CNS) depressant medications,
contrary to what current pain guidelines suggest. These guidelines, however, adapt evidence primarily from
younger populations or older adults with healthy cognition and whether they are suitable for ADRD patients
remains unclear. To inform treatment decisions for pain management in ADRD, there is an urgent need for
evidence on the clinical effects of existing opioid prescribing practices, considering outcomes aligned with
treatment goals. For older adults who suffer from chronic pain, there is a strong need to understand if opioids
improve or worsen cognition to help clarify inconclusive findings in the current literature. To fill these research
gaps, this proposed study will leverage nationally representative longitudinal survey and assessment data that
are linked to Medicare claims to study opioid prescribing practices on outcomes of ADRD patients residing in
communities and nursing homes. Specifically, we will examine the associations between the continuation of
chronic opioid therapy with outcomes in patients with ADRD and chronic non-cancer pain. We will also evaluate
the extent to which concurrent use of opioids with CNS drugs is associated with outcomes in patients with
ADRD receiving chronic opioid therapy. Furthermore, we will assess associations between opioid use and
changes in cognitive function among non-demented older adults who had moderate or severe pain. We will
consider a range of clinical outcomes, including pain intensity, physical and mental health, and safety
outcomes, including fall-related injuries, hospitalizations, and opioid use disorder or overdose. Our study will
provide empirical evidence on the effects of common opioid prescribing practices on health outcomes pertinent
to patients with ADRD and elucidate the role of opioids on cognition in older adults with chronic pain. Because
ADRD populations are rarely included in trials, our data will have great potential to further knowledge of the
benefits and harms of opioid treatment and inform optimal use and safe opioid prescribing in patients with
ADRD. The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve management of chronic pain in older adults,
particularly those with cognitive impairment."
10891623,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid use disorder (OUD) i.e. opioid abuse and addiction is a national crisis that affects more than 2 million
Americans with an estimated economic burden of $78.5 billion each year. Currently, an estimated 100 million
Americans suffer from chronic pain. Nearly 30% of chronic pain patients also suffer from OUD, and these
numbers are at risk to rise dramatically due to the lack of reliable alternate pain management strategies. The
principle motive for OUD among chronic pain patients is pain avoidance. Fear and conditioned avoidance of
cues formerly associated with pain are typical maladaptive behavior that exaggerates pain leading to opioid use.
To effectively reduce opioid dependency among chronic pain patients and provide alternate non-opioid
interventions, we need a mechanistic understanding of pain avoidance behavior. Additionally, identifying traits
and OUD related risk factors that influence maladaptive pain avoidance behavior can help not only to detect
chronic pain patients vulnerable to OUD, but also prevent acute pain patients vulnerable to chronic pain. This
proposal conceptualizes pain avoidance behavior as a cue-pain associative learning problem, based on the well-
established predictive coding framework. According to predictive coding, when expected and observed sensory
information diverge, a prediction error (PE) message is generated in the brain. Learning is the process by which
PE acts as a teaching signal to update expectations that motivate actions to avoid pain (e.g. hot stove = pain).
Chronic pain patients' display impaired cue-pain associative learning resulting in overgeneralization of sensory
cues and avoidance spreading to technically safe cues (e.g. cooking = pain). In aim-1, we investigate the
fundamental mechanisms involved in impaired cue-pain associative learning using an instrumental pain
avoidance task in conjunction with computational reinforcement learning models. In aim-2, we examine the
influence of personality traits and OUD related risk factors as possible moderators of pain avoidance behavior
using multi-level mediation analysis. In aim-3, we identify neurophysiological constructs of pain avoidance using
regressors derived from computational models. The proposed task will be performed in
Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a brain mapping tool to study brain rhythms and oscillations. The candidate,
Dr. Gopalakrishnan, is a Biomedical Engineer with expertise in neuronal electrophysiology and signal
processing, with special interest in chronic pain. This K01 will provide the candidate the resources needed to
enhance his knowledge in pain, OUD and addiction, and train the candidate in computational psychophysiology
and multimodal clinical trials research. The candidate's goal is to improve our understanding of basic science
behind pain avoidance behavior in order to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies that will reduce
OUD and its burden on society."
10891625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces
visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids
and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and
far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens
of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for
self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
[AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening
methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening
that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.
 In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse
detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is
common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to
mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial
intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern
NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the
most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of
current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases
 In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers
successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a
sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance
of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing
multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared
across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The
resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid
misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s
substance use treatment needs.
 We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over
35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The
top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in
a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with
questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance
misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in
hospitalized patients and guiding interventions."
10889792,"Abstract
 One of the long-held mysteries in chromatin signaling is the excessive number of enzymes that install
or remove a single chromatin mark. The most extreme case is histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) methylation, a
hallmark of transcriptionally active chromatin areas. H3K4me can be placed by six writer enzymes and
removed by six eraser enzymes, most of which are expressed broadly in all cell types of the brain and other
tissues. Strikingly, 10 of these 12 enzymes are responsible for monogenic forms of neurodevelopmental
disorders. These enzymes thus have non-redundant yet poorly understood roles in cognitive development and
function. Why do our brains need this many enzymes for the single histone mark?
 Cognitive function critically relies on a neural network's capability to rewire in response to sensory
inputs. However, the same network needs to maintain its excitability within an optimal range; otherwise, the
continuous sensory inputs or lack thereof could lead to excessive neuronal activity or inactivity, harmful to the
brain functions. Synaptic scaling is believed to be a way to meet the two competing demands. In response to
sustained hyperactivity, neurons scale down the receptivity to excitatory neurotransmitters. Conversely,
prolonged network inactivity causes neurons to scale up and increase synaptic efficacy. Prior studies revealed
that transcription in response to activity shifts is necessary for synaptic scaling. We now know several
chromatin regulators essential in the process. However, we know very little about the roles of histone H3K4me
enzymes in synaptic scaling.
 Our goal is to determine the roles of this prominent family of histone H3K4me enzymes in synaptic
scaling. The research team combines expertise in chromatin biology (Iwase lab.) and synaptic plasticity
(Sutton lab.) to attain this goal. We will test the hypothesis that H3K4me writer enzymes and their functional
interaction with H3K4me eraser enzymes delineate distinct facets of synaptic scaling. To this end, the
research team will 1) Generate the division of labor map of the H3K4me writer enzymes in synaptic scaling, 2)
Explore the molecular mechanisms by which KMT2A, an H3K4me writer enzyme, governs induction of
synaptic scaling. 3) Determine the functional interactions between H3K4me writer and eraser enzymes in
synaptic plasticity and behavior.
 Completion of the proposed research will reveal how H3K4me signaling stabilizes the neural ensemble.
In addition, our work will shed light on how the evolving brains have coopted expanded families of H3K4me
enzymes to achieve an intricate balance of network excitability. The obtained knowledge will be a foundation
on which evidence-based therapeutics can develop for H3K4me-related neurodevelopmental disorders and
many other cognitive deficits with chromatin dysregulation."
10889790,"Project Summary
 The overall goal of this project is to develop lower-limb clothing and optimization-based algorithms that merge
information from electronic textiles, inertial sensors, portable load cells, and biomechanical models to characterize
the pressure sources at the physical interface between residual lower-limbs and prosthetic sockets. The project will
enable analysis of pressure for more than 16 continuous hours outside the laboratory with automatic calibration of
pressure magnitude and its location relative to the human body. The health outcomes of prostheses and orthoses
depend on the physical interface between compliant human tissue and the rigid or padded structures of the device.
Quantifying this pressure can inform clinicians on how to prevent ulcers or other side effects of poorly managed
physical interfaces, particularly for users with reduced sensation (e.g., due to diabetes or spinal cord injury).
However, existing knowledge to relate interface pressure and health outcomes is inconclusive, in part, because 1)
available data do not capture the long-term effects of interface pressures and 2) measurements represent mostly
laboratory conditions. Pressure recordings depend on expert supervision for sensor calibration and placement —
to the extent that there is no user-driven method to accurately measure a complete day of pressure activity. The
state-of-the-art focuses on sensor design to improve accuracy and ease of use, but accurate pressure readings are
only a portion of the challenge; unsupervised pressure measurements require biomechanical context for calibration
and interpretation. For example, pressure on the distal end of a prosthetic socket can increase when there is
a transition from swing to stance or a volume change of the residual limb. This project will enable interface
pressure and gait-event information for a complete day of activity outside the clinic and the laboratory without
expert supervision. The central hypothesis is that, by combining information from inertial sensors, external forces,
pressure sensors, and biomechanical models, it is possible to generate accurate user-driven pressure measurements
without the need for expert calibration or placement.
 The specific aims of this project are to 1) create an optimization framework to calibrate pressure sensors with
partially unknown placement, 2) develop a clothing paradigm for pressure and inertial measurements in residual
limbs, and 3) demonstrate the feasibility of one day of unsupervised pressure measurements outside the laboratory.
Successful completion of these specific aims will establish a generalizable wearable sensing platform, which enables
the analysis of long-term body exposure to lower-limb device pressures. The project will apply existing knowledge
in biomechanics, robotics, mechanics and materials for stretchable e-textiles, and robust optimization to accomplish
these aims. Subsequent studies might focus on reducing the risks associated with asymmetric loading through
pressure monitoring, or the design of feedback control laws for lower-limb exosuits that maximize comfort through
pressure feedback."
10891697,"PROJECT SUMMARY and ABSTRACT
 The vast majority of biological functions use membrane-embedded proteins. Controlling the quality and
quantity of these membrane proteins is critical for these processes to work normally, and defects in the ability
to destroy misfolded proteins or getting rid of membrane proteins that are no longer needed cause a plethora
of human diseases. A central mechanism used to specify which proteins undergo degradation is attaching
ubiquitin to them. Ubiquitin is a small protein that is extremely well-conserved across the entire kingdom of
eukaryotic organisms. When ubiquitin is chemically linked to a membrane protein, it causes that protein to be
degradaded by cellular machinery that can recognize ubiquitin. Ubiquitin can also be linked to another
ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. Different polyubiquitin chains are made by changing how one ubiquitin
is linked to another, and different ubiquitin chains are used by different degradation machines. One machine
sorts membrane proteins to the interior of lysosomes by first sorting them into intralumenal vesicles that
accumulate within multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVB). MVB sorting primarily uses ubiquitin chains that
are linked via lysine-63 of ubiquitin, which binds to a number of endosomal proteins that cluster and sort
ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles. These intralumenal vesicles can either be
delivered to the interior Lysosomes and be degraded, or they can be secreted as extracellular
vesicles/exosomes, that carry and delivery contents to other cells to elicit a range biological effects.
 Many critical questions remain outstanding about how proteins are sorted into endosomal intralumenal
vesicles and what differentiates how they are sorted to Lysosomes versus being sorted into exosomes. Aim1
will address these questions by examining the molecular mechanisms that two homologous sorting proteins
use to differentially sort proteins into intralumenal vesicles that go to Lysosomes or become exosomes.
 Additional questions remain about whether ubiquitin attachment to membrane proteins in the trans-
Golgi Network, Endosomes, and cell surface that have made it through their initial synthesis in the
endoplasmic reticulum (so-called ‘post-ER’ proteins) exclusively sends them through the MVB pathway as their
mode of degradation. We found that post-ER proteins modified with a different type of polyubiquitin chain are
sent along a different pathway for degradation. Aim2 will study the molecular features of this pathway and
assess how this pathway may contribute to controlling the quality and quantity of membrane proteins."
10891698,"CD8+ T lymphocytes are essential players in mounting protective cellular immune responses against
pathogens and malignantly transformed cells. To sustain immunocompetency, the naïve CD8+ T cell pool must
be maintained at a stable size. Upon activation, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic effector and
memory cells that clear pathogens and provide heightened long-term protection, respectively. With the advent
of demonstrated efficacy of adoptive cell therapy using naturally occurring or gene-engineered T cells, it is
critical to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell homeostasis, fate
decision and differentiation. Such knowledge has important bearing on rational design of prophylactic vaccines
and immunotherapy to treat viral infections and cancers.
Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation represents an important research front in CD8+ T cell biology. A
plethora of factors have been extensively investigated for their capacity of controlling CD8+ T cell activity. It
remains a major knowledge gap on how the actions of the CD8+ regulatory factors are orchestrated within the
framework of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Our research goal is to uncover the less-charted
regulatory functions of chromatin architecture in programming CD8+ T cell homeostasis and differentiation. The
specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1. To investigate Tcf1/Lef1 cooperativity with CTCF and Stat5 to promote CD8+ homoeostasis.
Homeostatic cytokines (IL-7 and IL-15) and Stat5 pathway have an established central role in maintaining
CD8+ T cell pool size. We will use unbiased systems biology approaches to determine the interplay of
Tcf1/Lef1, CTCF and Stat5 on the levels of genomic elements and 3D genomic topology. These studies will
place the dogmatic Stat5 pathway within the framework of 3D genome organized by Tcf1/Lef1 and CTCF,
providing architectural basis for regulation of CD8+ homeostasis.
Aim 2. To investigate the requirements for CTCF in CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-viral/tumor immunity.
Memory CD8+ T cells, especially the CD62L+ central memory T (Tcm) cells, provide heightened protection
against the same pathogen. We will combine high-resolution HiChIP and state-of-the-art functional assays to
establish the causative link between CTCF-anchored chromatin interactions and CD8+ T cell functional output.
Using inducible expression of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in naïve CD8+ and Tcm cells, we will further
discern the intrinsic requirements for CTCF in differentiation of tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells.
This proposal will mechanistically elucidate the dynamic interplay of genome organizers and chromatin
architecture in programming CD8+ T cell homeostasis and differentiation in anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity.
These efforts may lead to paradigm-shifting advances in scientific knowledge, and provide novel insights into
devising more effective vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancers."
10889410,"Abstract:
With increased use of fentanyl or fentanyl-analog compounds in the United States, the opioid epidemic has
evolved into a `fentanyl epidemic.' Overdose deaths involving these extremely potent mu-opioid receptor
(MOR) agonists have increased ~30-40-fold in the last 20 years. Moreover, in 2021, drug overdose deaths in
the United States topped 100,000 for the first time ever and more than half of all deaths involved fentanyl or
fentanyl analogs. Yet, the brain neuroadaptations induced by fentanyl and fentanyl analog exposure remain
poorly described. Additionally, it is not known if the high amount of fentanyl-associated deaths are due to
fentanyl being `more addictive' than other opioids, or if fentanyl induces a unique set of neuroadaptations
associated with increased opioid seeking. The limited literature describing molecular alterations following
fentanyl exposure in comparison with other well-studied opioids such as morphine indicates divergency
amongst MOR agonists for neuroadaptations involving microRNA (miRNA) regulation and gene expression.
miRNAs inhibit protein translation to modulate gene expression and have recently emerged as critical
regulators of drug seeking for many drug classes. miRNAs have additional utility as biomarkers because
miRNAs are present in exosomes found in serum of peripheral blood samples. Investigation into the
relationship between drug exposure and regulation of brain miRNAs that can also be detected in the periphery
can be accomplished easily with rodent models of self-administration but has yet to be done. In this exploratory
project, we will use rat opioid self-administration to: 1) examine the acute and long-lasting effects of fentanyl or
the ultra-potent analog furanylfentanyl on exosomal blood serum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) brain
microRNA (miRNA) profiles; 2) compare the fentanyl-induced miRNA profiles to the less potent opioid heroin;
3) correlate fentanyl-induced blood and brain miRNA profiles to opioid seeking behavior at multiple timepoints;
and 4) directly compare fentanyl-, furanylfentanyl- and heroin-induced drug seeking behavior at response-
equivalent dosages to identify agonist-specific differences in long-lasting drug seeking behavior. This project
will provide critical insight into both the immediate and long-lasting molecular consequences of fentanyl and
furanylfentanyl exposure on brain neurochemistry and identify miRNA-mediated pathways associated with
opioid seeking. Therefore, this study provides an essential opportunity to understand the relationship between
blood and brain miRNA expression as an indication of opioid craving. Studies of blood miRNA profiles
associated with drug seeking behavior have translational potential, as biomarkers indicative of recovery from
substance use or relapse may help to inform patient care or treatment responsiveness."
10890532,"ABSTRACT
Mechanosensing is a process inherent to nearly all cell types, including vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells
where pressure-induced vascular stretch initiates a mechano-dependent vasoconstriction. This response,
termed pressure-induced constriction, occurs in numerous organs including the kidney and serves at least two
functions: control of local blood flow and prevention of transmission of damaging high systemic pressures to
delicate microvessels. A loss of the pressure-induced constriction response increases susceptibility to vascular
injury in organs, including the kidney where a loss of this response accelerates progression of chronic kidney
disease. Despite the importance of the pressure-induced constriction response, molecular mechanism(s)
underlying its initiation remain unclear. We have shown that members of epithelial Na+ channel
(ENaC)/degenerin family of ion channels (bENaC and ASIC2) are required for renal afferent arteriolar pressure-
induced constriction. The role of other family members, including gENaC, is unknown. TrpC6 has been suggested
to contribute to vascular mechanosignaling in cerebral arteries. However, its role in pressure-induced constriction
in renal afferent arterioles is unknown. We recently found that b and gENaC and ASIC2 form functional,
mechanoactivated channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our proposed studies address the hypothesis
that b/gENaC-ASIC2 channels and TrpC6 have different roles in VSM cell mechano-signaling in renal afferent
atherioles. Specifically, b/gENaC-ASIC2 channels mediate mechano-receptor currents, whereas TrpC6 channels
contribute to signal amplification. In Specific Aim 1, we will use the Xenopus oocyte expression system to define
the functional characteristics of b/gENaC-ASIC2 channels, and determine the mechanistic roles of b and gENaC,
ASIC2 and TrpC6 in mechano-receptor currents and post-mechano-receptor Ca2+ signaling in renal afferent
VSM cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contributions of b and gENaC, ASIC2 and TrpC6 to pressure-
induced constriction in renal afferent arterioles. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine if VSM-specific loss of
expression of ENaC subunits, ASIC2 or TrpC6 contributes to renal injury in the setting of hypertension. In
summary, our proposed studies will determine the mechanistic roles of b/gENaC-ASIC2 and TrpC6 channels in
mechanical signaling and in protecting against kidney injury."
10892657,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The mission of the proposed Kidney Precision Medicine Project Tissue Interrogation
Site (TIS) is to apply a platform of integrated multiomic imaging and spatially resolved molecular technologies to
biopsies from patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) to define key pathways
and understand the molecular drivers of disease heterogeneity. This TIS will leverage the unique resources of
the Mass Spectrometry Research Center and VU Biomolecular Imaging Center, as well as the world-class clinical
environment of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the valuable input of our patient partner, and the
advanced biocomputational infrastructure available through the data analysis laboratories at Vanderbilt
University and the Delft University of Technology. The main objectives of our TIS are to: (1) generate high quality
images of kidney biopsies using an innovative state-of-the-art multimodal imaging pipeline that includes matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), autofluorescence, and stained
microscopy; (2) acquire spatially resolved proteomics and transcriptomics data using microLESA, laser capture
microdissection, and the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler as well as perform network and enrichment analysis to
validate and enhance biological interpretation of the imaging data; and (3) implement advanced data analysis
strategies to identify potential biomarkers and optimal points of therapeutic intervention. With this suite of
technologies, data analysis capabilities, and previous experience developing atlases of healthy-for-age human
kidney tissue, we will create kidney tissue atlases to define the molecular landscape of biopsies from various
patient populations (e.g., age, race, sex) as well as of AKI and CKD clinical phenotypes, disease states, and
transitions; with an eye toward determining potential disease subclasses. To accomplish these aims, we
assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators consisting of complementary expertise in
nephrology, cell biology, analytical chemistry, and data science."
10890308,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deciphering the functional consequences of naturally occurring human genetic variation is critical to our
understanding of human disease as well as to the advancement of precision medicine. The identification of loci
that influence disease progression in human populations is not only important for identifying druggable targets,
but also enables risk stratification approaches for the clinical management of disease. Unfortunately, practical
and biological limitations to cohort-based association studies have restricted our ability to identify and
mechanistically interrogate disease-relevant alleles, especially those that impact infectious diseases. As an
example, despite repeated efforts over several decades, only a handful of human genetic variants have been
linked to differences in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pathogenesis, and these are only able to explain
a small fraction of the observed clinical variation. One of these variants, a truncation in the HIV co-receptor
CCR5, has been shown to provide resistance to HIV infection and is the basis for the only four cases of HIV cure
achieved to date. Here, we propose to develop a new functional genomics platform for the engineering and
functional phenotyping of naturally occurring genetic variants to enable de novo identification of disease-relevant
alleles. Leveraging advances in gene editing technology, we seek to effectively recapitulate all known human
genetic variation at a given locus in a single test tube of cells for rapid and cost-effective functional screening.
As proof-of-principle, we aim to engineer and functionally classify the impact of all >1600 known naturally
occurring CCR5 variants on: 1) CCR5 cell surface expression, 2) HIV-1 susceptibility, and 3) efficacy of the
CCR5-targeting antiretroviral drug, Maraviroc. Using batched, tiled arrays of synthetic oligonucleotides, each
variant will be cloned into a homology-directed repair template and pooled into an allelic variant library. This
library will be delivered to a CCR5-haploid Jurkat cell line alongside CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes
targeting CCR5 to generate knock-in, polyclonal pools of cells harboring distinct naturally occurring variants.
These populations will be immunostained for CCR5, sorted, and subject to deep sequencing to identify variants
impacting cell surface expression. Subsequently, cells will be subject to multiple rounds of HIV-1 infection and
sorting to identify alleles with a protective phenotype. This same experiment will be done in the presence of the
Maraviroc, selecting for variants that escape antiretroviral activity of the drug. Genotype-phenotype relationships
will be additionally monitored at the single cell level by droplet-assisted RNA-targeting single-cell sequencing
(DART-seq) for added rigor. The most significantly impactful variants will be validated by targeted insertion into
primary human T cells to determine their impact on HIV infection ex vivo. Altogether, this proposal seeks to
provide an innovative, actionable approach for the identification and mapping of host factor determinants at
single nucleotide resolution with broad implications not only for the development of new HIV treatment modalities,
but for continued research on the role of host genetic variation in human disease."

Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have
evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting
methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to
determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim
1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large
human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to
predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type
1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved
in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion
of this study has the potential to improve management for AP."
10896426,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common (prevalence 1 in 500), nonprogressive developmental brain disorder (DBD)
characterized by neuromotor impairments often accompanied by other neurodevelopmental and medical
disorders. Birth asphyxia, long considered the most frequent cause of CP, accounts for <10% of cases and a
specific cause remains unknown for most individuals. A growing body of evidence suggests that a large
proportion of CP is caused by rare genomic variants, as has been shown for other DBDs. Additionally, the
contribution of common genomic variants to CP has not been adequately evaluated. Here, we propose to
elucidate the complete genomic architecture of CP, including the contribution of rare and common genomic
variants. We will capitalize on data generated from two complementary sources: 1) a pediatric CP cohort referred
for exome sequencing (ES) to a clinical genetics laboratory (GeneDx) and 2) an adult CP cohort from Geisinger’s
MyCode study, a large-scale genomics initiative with paired electronic health record (EHR), ES, and SNP
genotype data. As with other DBDs, clinical variability is common in CP and detailed genotype-phenotype
correlation studies are required to characterize the contributors to phenotypic variance. Similarly, neuroimaging
studies reveal brain abnormalities in 70-90% of individuals with CP; however, finding a neuroimaging abnormality
does not establish the underlying cause for most individuals without further evaluations and there is a lack of
neuroimaging studies to link genomic findings with CP. We will address these significant knowledge gaps through
the following aims: 1) Extract and standardize genomics, EHR, and neuroimaging data to create a large,
harmonized CP dataset for analysis. We will leverage genotype and phenotype data from 4,000 individuals with
CP and harmonize their available genomic, EHR, and neuroimaging data. 2) Determine the contribution of rare
genomic variants to the etiology of CP and identify new gene-disease relationships and CP-related genes; 3)
Evaluate the role of common genomic variants in CP and the influence of genomic liability for DBD on CP. We
will comprehensively assess the full genomic landscape of CP, including multiple classes of genomic variants.
4) Develop a genomically-informed approach to neuroimaging interpretation in CP and characterize genotype-
phenotype correlations for CP-related genes. We will perform genomically-informed neuroimaging interpretation
in a subgroup of participants with pathogenic variants to identify profiles of brain abnormalities related to specific
genes. We will also explore the contributors to clinical variability among individuals with rare variants in the same
gene. Overall, there is a very high likelihood of success that this project will lead to the identification of novel
genomic variants that cause CP. An immediate outcome of this study will be the generation of required evidence
to support the incorporation of clinical genomic testing into routine clinical care for individuals with CP. This
project will foster future research into molecular mechanisms of disease, which will be critical to developing
targeted therapies for specific genomic variants, and will inform clinical genomic testing for individuals with CP."
10896430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral cortex function requires correct assembly of circuit connectivities during development. Subplate
neurons, strategically positioned at the gray and white matter interface, play essential roles in assembling cortical
circuits, notably in guidance of thalamocortical axons and formation of sensory maps. Subplate neurons have
also been implicated in corpus callosum formation. Three non-cell autonomous mechanisms by which subplate
neurons support axon pathfinding have been proposed: 1) pioneering, wherein subplate neurons extend the first
axons and lay a path for cortical axons to follow; 2) co-fasciculation, wherein subplate descending axons closely
interact (“handshake”) with ascending axons to guide reciprocal connectivity; 3) extracellular matrix, wherein
subplate neurons provide a substrate for axon growth in nascent white matter. Subplate ablation studies have
shown subplate neurons to be indispensable. However, the genetic underpinnings of subplate neuron-mediated
axon guidance are largely unknown, in part due to a lack of genetic access to subplate neurons at embryonic
stages of circuit development. In a recent study (Doyle et al., PNAS, 2021), we reported a strategy to genetically
target subplate neurons. Using this approach to interrogate gene necessity and sufficiency in subplate neuron-
mediated circuit assembly, we discovered that the chromatin remodeler Arid1a is essential for the wiring
functions of subplate neurons. Human ARID1A mutations are a cause of Coffin-Siris syndrome, a developmental
disorder characterized by callosal agenesis. We found that cortical Arid1a deletion led to callosal agenesis and
thalamocortical axon misrouting reminiscent of subplate ablation. These miswiring phenotypes coincided with
disruptions in the transcriptional identity of subplate neurons, and deficits in subplate neuron wiring functions,
including subplate-thalamocortical axon “handshake” and extracellular matrix. Thus, in Arid1a, we identified a
multifunctional regulator of subplate neuron-dependent axon guidance functions – a key discovery that opens
doors to molecular and mechanistic studies on subplate neurons. In preliminary studies using the same genetic
strategy, we further identified an additional regulator of subplate-mediated circuit wiring in the transcription factor
Sox5. Mutations in human SOX5 cause Lamb-Shaffer syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
by intellectual disability. Here, we will leverage the exceptional opportunities that Arid1a and Sox5 provide to
study subplate neurons. We will use our expertise in molecular genetics, circuit neurobiology, genomics, and
chromatin biology, to identify the transcriptomic and genomic targets of Arid1a and Sox5 (Aims 1 and 2) and
gain a functional understanding of candidate genes in subplate neuron-dependent axon guidance (Aim 3). A key
implication of our work is that deficits in subplate neurons may be an underappreciated contributor to neural
circuit miswiring in neurodevelopmental disorders, including those associated with chromatin dysregulation.
Successful completion of the proposed study on subplate neurons will thus illuminate fundamental mechanisms
of circuit development, and the potential consequences of subplate dysfunction in developmental brain disorders."
10896436,"Abstract
Opioid use disorder is a debilitating disease with a high rate of relapse despite current treatment efforts. Clinical
and preclinical studies have found that opioid-induced chronic changes in gene expression underlie neuroplastic
alterations within the brain reward circuitry, including in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which lead to the life-long
propensity for relapse. Recent studies highlighted that epigenetic changes orchestrate the opioid abuse-induced
transcriptional plasticity. However, the causes for the epigenome changes and consequent transcriptome
alterations remain unclear.
 DNA damage and repair processes play important roles in chromatin integrity relating to proper
epigenetic signature and gene expression in cells. Postmitotic neurons are particularly susceptible to DNA
damage because of their high metabolic and transcriptional output. DNA breaks trigger the DNA damage repair
response, which involves extensive chromatin remodeling to incorporate DNA repair machinery. Therefore, DNA
breaks and repairs can progressively alter chromatin structure to alter gene expression patterns in neurons and,
ultimately, affect behaviors.
 Consistent with studies linking DNA damage and opioid addiction, our preliminary data suggest that DNA
breaks are increased in the postmortem PFC tissues from individuals with opioid use disorder and from mice
that self-administered heroin (a valid animal model for opioid addiction). Additionally, the increase in DNA breaks
was accompanied by altered expression of genes that are involved in DNA damage repair. More importantly,
experimentally introducing DNA breaks in the PFC potentiated heroin-seeking behavior in mice. Taken together,
these preliminary data provide evidence that DNA break and repair processes are linked to opioid addiction. Our
goal in this proposal is to identify and characterize the precise role of DNA breaks and repairs in opioid addiction.
 Using a unique combination of genomic, epigenomic, and translatomic approaches coupled with affinity
purification, we will fully characterize heroin-induced neuron-specific (PFC parvalbumin interneurons and
pyramidal neurons) alterations in DNA break and repair sites (i.e., the breakome) and the associated changes
in chromatin accessibility (i.e., the epigenome) and gene expression (i.e., the translatome). Additionally, using
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approaches, we will identify whether heroin-induced changes in DNA break and
repair sites are directly and causally linked to heroin-induced behavioral plasticity.
 This proposal will provide a solid foundation for a wide range of future research endeavors addressing the
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie opioid-induced long-term transcriptional maladaptation and
ultimately contribute to opioid addiction."
10896437,"Towards Targeting the Follicular Lymphoma Microenvironment
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common and still incurable form of B cell
lymphoma. FL is a slow growing cancer that shows a unique dependence on a
supportive microenvironment. The supportive niche also affects FL therapies. For
example, inhibitors of BTK, PI3K, or BCL2 show exciting activity against aggressive
lymphomas and chronic leukemia, but they have little activity against indolent FLs. We
speculate that the FL microenvironment protects and sustains the malignant B cells and
contributes to FL development, progression, and resistance to therapy. Conversely, we
propose that disrupting interactions in the FL niche will be especially effective against
FL. Our hypothesis is based on prior work by others and our own work on immune
receptor mutations in FL (e.g. TNFSRF14 and EphA7) have revealed cell-cell
interactions as key drivers and sustainers of FL biology.
My lab has made major contributions to our understanding of the biology and genetics of
FL. We built an accurate mouse model of FL and we and others have used this model to
interpret the biological function of the most common FL drivers. For example, we
reported on the role of epigenetic driver mutations in KMT2D, CREBBP, EZH2, we
investigated FL cell metabolism, cell cycle control, aberrant mRNA translation, and the
outstanding importance of immune receptors (e.g. TNFSRF14, b2M, EphA7) in FL
biology. This work has been reported in an extensive series of high-impact publications.
It has also led to several patent filings that protect experimental lymphoma therapies.
We now propose a systematic assessment of the cellular composition of the FL
microenvironment using cutting edge single-cell RNA sequencing on murine and human
FLs. We want to understand how tumor genotype, indolent versus transformed disease
stage, and therapy (esp. checkpoint inhibition) shapes the FL niche. We use single cell
data to formulate specific hypotheses concerning cell-cell interactions and we use
genetic and molecular biology tools to explore underlying mechanisms. Our goal is to
identify opportunities to disrupt the supportive niche and to exploit this for new therapies.
We have already had some success in this regard, and we engineered bi-functional
antibodies and modified CAR-T cells that target interactions between malignant B cells
and supportive niche elements.

In 2019, Hispanic/Latinx individuals were awarded 8.6% of the 187,568 doctoral degrees awarded in the US
despite accounting for 18.5% of the US population, while African American graduates were awarded 9.2% of
doctoral degrees despite accounting for 12.5% of the population. One reason for this disparity may be that
doctoral training including training of substance use researchers tends to take place at large Research 1 (R1;
Carnegie very high research activity designation) institutions, yet the majority of underrepresented minority
(URM) students who attend college in the US are not doing so at an R1 institution. For example, 67% of
Hispanic/Latinx college students attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) with only 10 of the 646 HSIs in the
US designated as R1 institutions. Students who attend HSIs, because they have had less access to research
opportunity and have fewer people in their peer networks who seek graduate training, may not have had the
chance to envision a post-baccalaureate life that involves graduate training. As a result, a significant
prospective pool of exceptional students do not make their way to doctoral training programs thereby greatly
delimiting diversity among, for example, substance use researchers. To bridge the divide between HSIs and
research-intensive environments we propose to recruit URM undergraduates from HSIs in their sophomore
year to participate in a two year program at New York University (NYU) with the goal of strengthening research
capacity and supporting application to an R1 graduate school. Recruitment sites include Mercy College and
five HSIs located across NYC that participate in the City University of New York (CUNY) Macaulay Honors
College. NYU faculty and mentors include over 20 NIDA-funded investigators from diverse racial/ethnic
backgrounds. Among DDIS scholars, we aim to build skills in foundational and implementation science
research methods and knowledge of substance use research through coursework and seminars (Aim 1). DDIS
scholars will complete in-person Research Methods Weekend Workshops at NYU (monthly; academic Year 1);
online modules in substance use research (~monthly; academic Year 1); in-person/teleconferenced seminars
at NYU for ongoing skills training (weekly) and Mercy College for career development (biweekly) over the
course of the two year program. We also aim to build capacity in conducting research, completing scientific
deliverables, and applying to graduate school through a sustained, intensive mentored research experience
(Aim 2). During the junior year DDIS scholars will be matched with a NIDA-funded research mentor at NYU
and will become integrated into the lab. In the summer between the junior and senior year, DDIS scholars will
work onsite at NYU and participate in an intensive mentored research experience. Through the senior year,
mentors will support student presentations, publications, and application to graduate training. Providing
rigorous and sustained training to support completion of scientific deliverables will increase competitive entry
into a doctoral program at an R1 institution among URM scholars, thereby paving their path to independence."
10896369,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is accepted as a geriatric syndrome and is nearly unique to older persons, particularly women. It affects 2.5 million persons, its prevalence is increasing, its prognosis is worsening, and pharmacologic trials have been negative. Our work and others’ suggest that HFpEF is initiated and promoted by systemic inflammation, which causes globally impaired organ function, including in the heart, arteries, lungs, and skeletal muscle, ultimately causing severe exercise intolerance, the primary manifestation of chronic HFpEF, impaired quality of life (QOL), hospitalization, loss of independence, and death. The source of the systemic inflammation has been unknown, but our preliminary data suggest a key role of abnormalities in the gut. Our preclinical studies show that barriers, including mucin production, are reduced in older gut causing ‘leaky gut’, which allows diffusion of bacteria and antigens from the gut into the circulation, thus causing systemic inflammation. Our clinical studies suggest that: a) older HFpEF patients have markedly reduced microbiome diversity with adverse gut microbiota that reduce production of beneficial metabolites that help maintain gut wall integrity and overall health; and b) that these abnormalities are associated with their severe exercise intolerance and are modifiable. Metformin, a generic, well-tolerated anti-diabetic medication may be an ideal candidate for repurposing for HFpEF. It has pleotropic effects against multiple aging-related mechanisms relevant to HFpEF. Our compelling preliminary data indicate that metformin strongly promotes favorable gut bacteria populations that produce beneficial metabolites, increases mucin production, and reduces leaky gut and systemic inflammation. We hypothesize that in older HFpEF patients, metformin will restore gut microbiome diversity and increase gut wall mucin, which in turn will reduce leaky gut and systemic inflammation and improve physical function. We will test this hypothesis with a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 20 weeks of metformin in 80 older HFpEF patients > age 60 years with measurements at baseline and follow-up of physical function, QOL, microbiome diversity, markers of leaky gut, and systemic inflammation to address three Specific Aims: 1) Determine if metformin treatment improves physical function and QOL in older patients with HFpEF; 2) Determine if metformin increases microbiome diversity, mucin in the feces, and reduces markers of leaky gut in serum and inflammation in gut and blood; 3) Determine if metformin-mediated improvements in physical function and QOL are associated with increased microbiome diversity, mucin, and reduced leakiness in gut and systemic inflammatory markers. This study is well aligned with the goals of RFA-AG-22-011 and many other NIA priorities, and will be conducted by a diverse, cohesive multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise. The proposed project could have a large impact by identifying the first pharmacologic treatment to improve symptoms and exercise intolerance in the large, growing, vulnerable, under-served population of older patients with HFpEF."

ADPRylation (ADPRylation) is a reversible of post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins resulting in the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose (ADPR) units derived from β-NAD+ on a variety of substrates.  It plays key roles in the control of cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation, that drive physiological outcomes, such as adipogenesis.  ADPRylation is catalyzed by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes, including the nuclear enzyme PARP-1.  Although PARP-1 and ADPRylation have historically been linked to DNA repair, growing evidence now supports their role in the regulation of gene expression.  However, key gaps in knowledge remain.  For example, the molecular mechanisms underlying PARP-1-mediated gene regulation have not been fully elucidated in signal-regulated biological systems.  Moreover, the role of site-specific ADPRylation as a mediator of tissue-specific physiological processes is poorly understood.  Our recent studies have begun to address these questions.  We have shown that PARP-1 modulates transcriptional responses in preadipocytes and macrophages that are (1) linked to site-specific modification of core histones and (2) controlled by signal-regulated transcription factors (TFs) (e.g., C/EBPβ). 
The long-term objective of these studies is to achieve a better understanding of the molecular, biochemical, genomic mechanisms underlying the control of signal-regulated transcription by PARP-1-mediated site-specific ADPRylation of key regulatory proteins, as well as the downstream physiological consequences of these regulatory events in adipose tissue.  Our broad hypothesis is that the gene regulatory activities of PARP-1 are mediated through site-specific ADPRylation of histones and TFs.  We will test this hypothesis using an integrated approach with a complementary of set tools from biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, chemical biology, proteomics, genomics, and mouse genetics.  In addition, we will test specific mechanistic hypotheses related to the role of PARP-1 in signal-regulated gene expression driven by ADPRylation of histones and C/EBPβ in preadipocytes and macrophages in fat tissue.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Explore the role of site-specific histone ADPRylation in signal-regulated gene expression in preadipocytes, as well as macrophages (Aim 1); (2) Determine how dynamic ADPRylation of C/EBPβ regulates enhancer function and target gene expression in macrophages (Aim 2); and (3) Determine the effects of site-specific ADPRylation of C/EBPβ on adipogenesis (Aim 3).  Collectively, these studies will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by PARP-1-mediated site-specific ADPRylation in adipogenesis.  Given the important role of PARP-1 in human disease, as well its potential “drugability,” our studies could lead to new ways to exploit these factors as therapeutic targets.  Furthermore, our studies have the potential to reveal new information that will shape the future of the field and may shed light more generally on the functions of ADPRylation."

 Poor sleep is very common in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and
their caregivers. It is significantly associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes and well-being
in both members of the group. Unmanaged poor sleep will further impact the quality of care that the caregivers
provide for the patients. This suggests a critical need of sleep management in this vulnerable population.
Unfortunately, an intervention addressing sleep problems of both members of the dyad simultaneously is
lacking, particularly using the behavioral strategies that have been effective in other groups. Effects of sleep
intervention programs in different delivery modalities are also unknown in this group.
 The current proposal aims to examine the efficacy of a dyadic sleep intervention program for ADRD
patients and their caregivers, that is built upon PI’s prior work. We propose a 3-arm randomized controlled trial
design (Stage II), including both in-person (n=70 dyads) and telehealth (n=70 dyads) delivery of the
intervention, compared to in-person sleep education control (n=70 dyads). The dyadic intervention is a 5-week,
manual-based program, which incorporates key components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, daily
light exposure and walking, and a problem-solving approach for ADRD-related problematic nighttime behaviors
and other caregiving challenges. All intervention sessions will be delivered by a sleep educator. Primary
outcomes include subjective and objective sleep quality of the dyads. Secondary outcomes include the
patients’ dementia-related behaviors and quality of life, and the caregivers’ burden, depression, and perceived
health. We will also explore effects of the dyadic sleep program on inflammatory markers among caregivers.
All outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., immediately after the last session of the
intervention), and 6-month after the last session. Both superior (both in-person and telehealth interventions
versus control) and non-inferior effects (in-person versus telehealth intervention) will be tested.
 A unique aspect of the proposed work is that the program is tailored to address sleep problems of both
patients and caregivers, and includes inflammatory biomarkers to evaluate a key mechanism of intervention
benefits that can be further explored in future research. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential
to improve the lives of ADRD patients and their caregivers. Our dyadic sleep intervention can be disseminated
to multiple communities serving ADRD patients and/or caregivers, including those that lack access to
traditional in-person sleep treatment. The intervention manual can also be used to train health professionals
and staff in various types of community programs."
10896375,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gender inequities are prevalent and persistent in the biomedical sciences. While women and men are equally
likely to enter medicine, women are less likely to advance in terms of promotion and leadership. The effects are
significant as women are less likely than men to publish as first/last authors, receive awards, and serve on
study sections—all critical measures for advancement. These workforce inequities have worsened over the
past 18 months as faculty have been adversely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies show these
disruptions have negative impacted career trajectory and productivity, with early career investigators, females,
and underrepresented in medicine groups most significantly affected. Early career faculty, including those at
pivotal points in their trajectory such as transitioning to independence, are more vulnerable to the pandemic’s
effects due to fewer established funding sources and publishing opportunities. Interventions are needed to
reduce these pandemic-related effects and thereby minimize worsening of inequities long-term. Coaching, a
practice commonly utilized in business and management, holds potential to be a high-impact intervention for
early career investigators. Coaching applies inquiry, encouragement, and accountability to increase self-
awareness, motivation, and the capacity to take effective action. The current literature on coaching in medicine
suggests benefits for clinicians and administrators in terms of process metrics largely. Few studies have
focused on investigators, combined individual and group coaching with customized feedback, or examined
productivity and advancement outcomes. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate a professional
coaching intervention directed at early career investigators. Participants will include individuals with a K-level or
equivalent award who self-identify as female or nonbinary, with efforts made to maximize diversity in the study.
This novel intervention is based on principles of social cognitive career theory, and content is aligned with
researcher competencies and informed by early career researchers. Outcomes focus on established hallmarks
of success for faculty investigators, including self-efficacy, research productivity, and career advancement
obtained through surveys (Aim 1 and 2). These data will be combined with interviews to fully capture the
impact of the coaching program by understanding nuanced individual experiences (Aim 1) and experiential
sampling method to examine the mechanism by which the program fosters research productivity and career
persistence (Aim 3). Results from this study will provide rigorous evidence about the effect of a novel, theory-
based coaching intervention on female early-career investigators while offering a scalable approach that can
be readily adopted by academic institutions and professional organizations. Dissemination will be supported by
the development of a train-the-coach guide and coaching program toolkit. Such interventions are vital to
increase the proportion of underrepresented scientists who persist in the biomedical research workforce in
order to address the health needs of the nation’s diverse population."

The research in our laboratory is centered on the development of force-based mechanical
approaches to biomolecular and cellular imaging, and leveraging these capabilities to study a
number of questions in biomolecular dynamics and cells mechanics. Our approach to imaging
offers new capabilities in probing chemical, mechanical and electrical characteristics of
biological systems from molecules to cells. In biomolecular imaging, we focus on problems in
structural biology that can benefit from direct imaging in physiologically relevant conditions
where mechanical approaches like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have advantages. We
currently develop an AFM-based method to image dynamics of RNA/protein complexes and
membrane proteins with Angstrom scale resolution. In cell mechanical studies, we recently
developed a cell stiffness imaging method that provided unprecedented spatial resolution,
which helped reveal nanoscale patterns in cell stiffness that are described by precise
mathematical relationships. Existence of these patterns are not predicted by the current
quantitative models of cell mechanics. We developed a new model that not only explained our
findings, but also made new testable predictions that we subsequently confirmed. These
molecular and cellular studies shape the current research goals in our laboratory. On the
biomolecular imaging front, our goal for the next five years is to develop our technology to
achieve imaging of biomolecular dynamics in physiologically relevant conditions with Angstrom-
scale resolution. Currently, such high-resolution data is mainly coming from methods that work
with frozen or crystallized samples, which prevent observations of biomolecular dynamics. On
the cell mechanics front, our goals for the next five years include further developing our cell
mechanical model to address a large discrepancy between results measured by different
methods used by researchers. We believe the discrepancy is not due to technical problems of
various methods, but rater due to underlying assumptions about contact mechanics of cells,
that is, a conceptual issue. Addressing this discrepancy can help better predict cell mechanical
behavior in physiological contexts. We are also interested in investigating electromechanical
coupling in cell membranes and have already built a uniquely suited experimental setup to
probe electromechanical coupling in cell membranes. We are motivated by our recent
observations of strong coupling effects and potential effects of coupling on gating of ion
channels and the morphology of membranous organelles. Overall, the vision of our research
program is set by the important roles of nanoscale mechanical interactions in biology, and we
develop biophysical models and experimental capabilities to realize our vision."

Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) that is associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Without any intervention, ~11% of children with SCA will develop stroke before their 17th
birthday. Evidence-based practices for primary stroke prevention include screening for abnormal
transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy for at least one
year, then hydroxyurea therapy for an indefinite period. In high-resource countries this strategy has
dropped stroke incidence rates by 92%. In Nigeria, approximately 150,000 children with SCA are born
annually, accounting for more than half of the total births with SCA worldwide. In comparison, there are only
1,700 affected births of children with SCA in the United States annually. Among each birth cohort, 15,000
children will have stroke annually in Nigeria. In 2016, as part of the capacity building objective of our Stroke
Prevention Trial in Nigeria (SPRING,1R01NS094041) at Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital (BDTH) in Kaduna,
TCD screening was adopted as standard of care. Before the trial, no TCD screening was performed at our
trial site. Currently as standard of care, physicians at BDTH perform TCD screening, however, only 5.4%
(1,101/20,040) of the eligible children with SCA living in Kaduna, Nigeria were reached. With just 21
radiologists and only 3 certified in TCD screening in Kaduna State, clearly, to achieve a decrease in stroke
incidence among children with SCA living in Kaduna, and elsewhere, we must have a better
implementation strategy to increase TCD screening. We therefore propose to initiate a stroke prevention
program in a community hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria by task-shifting TCD screening and stroke detection to
nurses. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) Identify barriers and facilitators that influence the adaptability of
the transported intervention, including implementation process; 2) Build capacity for stroke detection and
prevention in SCA in a community hospital; and 3) Conduct a feasibility trial comparing the effectiveness of
a physician-based primary stroke prevention program in a teaching hospital to a task-shifted primary stroke
prevention program in a community hospital.The proposed training and research will be conducted at Barau
Dikko Teaching Hospital and Yusuf Dantsoho Memorial hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria and will provide
preliminary data for a definitive randomized clinical trial in implementation science. A mentoring team of
senior researchers in United States and Nigeria will supervise the applicant. The mentoring team has
extensive research expertise in clinical trials in sickle cell disease and implementation science. The overall
research objective is to develop strategies that will improve primary prevention of strokes in children with
SCA."
10896187,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the US, with over
100,000 patients living with the disease. While survival rates at 10 years have improved, almost all patients with
FL receive multiple chemo- or immunotherapies over their lifetime and most eventually relapse and progress.
There exists no highly effective targeted therapy for FL and the standard of care for FL patients remains largely
based on chemoimmunotherapy. New drugs like the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the PIK3CD/PI3Kδ inhibitor
idealisib have improved the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
However, these drugs are less effective in FL or are linked to serious side effects.
 Over the last eight years we have contributed to the discovery and initial functional characterization of
recurrent mutations in FL, including in the SWI/SNF component ARID1A, linker histones (HIST1H1 B-E), IRF8,
the mTOR regulator RRAGC, various components of the autophagy and mTOR regulator vATPase (ATP6V1B2,
VMA21) and STAT6. One of the important genes that emerged from our efforts is Signal Transducer and
Activator of Transcription (STAT6), which is mutated in 11-23% of all FL and transformed FL (tFL). Frequent
mutations in STAT6 have also been described in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), Hodgkin's
lymphoma (HL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). STAT6 is part of the IL-4/JAK/STAT6 survival axis
of B cells, which is also activated by elevated IL-4 levels present in FL LNs. The FL-associated mutations in
STAT6 target amino acid hotspots, which are located in the STAT6 DNA binding domain. We have demonstrated
that mutated STAT6 proteins result in the hyper activation of the expression of known STAT6 target genes (e.g.
FCER2, CISH, CCL17, NFIL3). The identification of these gain-of-function properties changed the prevailing
view of lymphoma-associated STAT6 mutations, which previously were believed to be hypomorphs.
 There remain however important unanswered questions pertaining to the molecular properties and functional
consequences of mutated (MUT) STAT6 in lymphoma that are the focus of this proposal. These include the
delineation of genome-wide binding sites of MUT as compared with WT STAT6 in B cells and the complete
characterization of the genes that are transcriptionally regulated by MUT STAT6. Furthermore, the properties
and biological consequences of the transcriptional programs that are activated or repressed by STAT6 in FL B
cells or normal germinal center B cells are largely unknown. There is also untapped potential for the future
targeting of the IL-4/JAK/STAT6 axis in FL and our proposed studies aim at providing the rationale to inform
such studies. Finally, we will explore the interactions between STAT6 MUT FL B cells and the FL lymphnode
resident microenvironment, especially with regards to T cell subsets."

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are heterogenous and usually present with complex etiology. Individuals
with these conditions present with cognitive impairment accompanied by lifelong deficits; yet remarkably little is
known about their neurological basis. Patients and their families are in desperate need for disease-modifying
therapies. However, to develop effective treatments, it is imperative to understand the dysregulation of molecular
and cellular processes leading to these conditions. PACS1 Syndrome is a NDD caused by a single R203W
substitution in the Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting 1 (PACS1) protein in over 200 patients. Moreover,
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the human PACS1 locus as a susceptibility gene in severe
early-onset obesity, developmental delay, and bipolar disorder, suggesting a broader role in brain development.
PACS1 encodes a multifunctional protein which canonical cytosolic function in the secretory pathway is to direct
its cargo to the trans-Golgi Network.However, PACS1 also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), shuttles
to the nucleus during S phase, and, at least in highly proliferative cancer cells, regulates chromatin stability
through interaction with HDAC proteins. Despite previous studies have revealed critical PACS1 functions, the
role of PACS1 within the nucleus as well as the effect of the PACS1 R203W variant in the nervous system yet
to be determined. Thus, we have generated patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral
organoids to investigate the transcriptome of a developing patterned, three-dimensional neural structure with the
patient genetic background. By performing single cell RNA Sequencing in organoids during early development,
we generated a preliminary dataset that strongly indicate that regulates a gene expression program important
for Glutamatergic/GABAergic fate specification. Altogether, evidence regarding nuclear localization of PACS1,
in addition to our preliminary data, suggests that PACS1 has an unexplored nuclear function, possibly by
regulating gene expression in neural progenitors. Therefore, we hypothesize that PACS1 regulates
Glutamatergic/GABAergic balance through a non-canonical nuclear function that decreases as neurogenesis
proceeds. Thus, PACS1 deficits result in a shift towards GABAergic fate, generating ectopic GABAergic neurons,
subsequent Glutamatergic/GABAergic imbalance, and finally NDD phenotypes. We will test this hypothesis by
addressing whether PACS1 possesses context specific functions that differ across neural differentiation (aim1),
and deficits in PACS1 nuclear function alter Glutamatergic/GABAergic specification balance (aim2). Results from
this proposal will greatly enhance our understanding of how the PACS1 deficits affect the developing nervous
system, by uncovering a currently disregarded nuclear function. Moreover, our work will expand our knowledge
of the molecular underpinnings and consequences of the Glutamatergic/GABAergic imbalance, that has
repeatedly been described as a precursor of many NDDs, pointing towards a possible common mechanism from
genetically heterogeneous origins and may ultimately reveal convergent therapy targets."

Perinatal mental health disorders are the most prevalent perinatal comorbidity and are associated with the
primary cause of maternal mortality in the United States (US) – suicide. Diagnosis of a high-risk pregnancy and
cesarean delivery (CD) are both associated with increased risk for perinatal mood, anxiety, and trauma
symptoms (PMATS). There are over 1 million CDs annually in the US with one-third of these patients reporting
PMATS. Directing prevention efforts toward high-risk pregnant patients requiring CD addresses risk for PMATS
in a large patient population. There is a deficit in resources and access to mental health treatment for pregnant
patients, with some treatments being cost prohibitive and requiring multiple sessions. Additionally, current
approaches to addressing PMATS are reactive rather than preventive. There is evidence in the non-obstetric
population that single-session cognitive behavioral therapy interventions targeting anxiety sensitivity (fear of
fear) can prevent the development of anxiety and trauma symptoms when individuals are exposed to a trauma.
We developed a low cost, 1-hour, single-session prevention intervention that included psychoeducation about
anxiety sensitivity, coupled with a brief exposure to the operating room environment and CD procedures. We
previously tested this Brief Exposure intervention in the Operating Room (BE-OR) among a small group of
pregnant patients anticipating CD at a fetal care center and found a significant reduction in PMATS in the short
(1-4 weeks) and the long term (6-8 weeks). These results are incredibly promising, but scalability to a large
labor and delivery (L&D) unit with a more diverse patient population has not been established. To revise
implementation plan and BE-OR for use in large L&D units with a broader population of patients, a fully
powered multisite randomized control trial (RCT) is needed. Prior to initiating such a trial, Stage 1A/1B work
needs to be done to modify the intervention and implementation through a process of iterative refinement to
enhance acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of implementation in L&D units across the country, as
well as its efficacy at engaging with the target mechanism (anxiety sensitivity). Using a logic model to guide the
iterative refinement process through fast feedback loops and an atmosphere of co-creation, study investigators
will gather critical input from stakeholders (individuals with lived experiences, community partners, front-line
clinicians, hospital staff) via 12 workgroups, 12 user-testing design sessions, and repeated engagement with a
steering council. Following this refinement process, a treatment development pilot RCT (N=80) at a large L&D
unit will assess the efficacy of BE-OR by probing engagement with the target mechanism, as well as assess
feasibility of implementation. Finally, the updated logic model and pilot trial results will inform the development
of a protocol for a multisite RCT through engagement with expert consultants in a community engagement
studio and further feedback from the steering council. This study will be the first in a long line of research
broadening to additional risk groups, perinatal care settings, and intervention modalities to reduce PMATS."

Alcohol withdrawal (WD) produces a range of dangerous clinical symptoms, including intense seizures.
Hyperexcitability underlying seizures is produced by an array of intrinsic membrane properties that are
disrupted by ethanol (EtOH). Prior work has demonstrated that chronic EtOH exposure and WD produce an
up-regulation of ion channel proteins and a gain of function that promotes WD seizure. A remaining gap in
our understanding of WD-related seizure is a testable model that places cellular changes in a network
context. WD produces upregulation and increased bursting in midline thalamic nuclei. In hippocampus,
mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated in CA1 neurons during WD, represses
translation of Kv1.1, and results in reduced inhibition that we hypothesize will allow invasion of thalamic
bursts and increased epileptiform population discharges. We have developed a new model of network
excitability that will allow us to study the emergence, time course and molecular underpinnings of EtOH WD
hyperexcitability and seizure. We will address the following aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the intrinsic
properties contributing to membrane hyperexcitability in midline thalamus and CA1 due to ethanol WD
seizure. Using voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro preparation coupled with pharmacological approaches,
we will determine whether epileptiform discharges in WD are ultimately dependent on a progressive
imbalance between excitatory burst discharges in thalamus (which depend on PKC), and reduced K+ currents
in CA1 pyramidal cells (which are controlled by mTOR). In Aim 2, we will Determine important regulators of
dendritic excitability in thalamus and CA1 in EtOH WD seizure. mTOR signaling is implicated in the
development of spontaneous seizures in epilepsy, and we show data that it is active during WD. Using
molecular approaches, we will toggle mTOR activity in the presence and absence of protein synthesis
inhibitors. We will test whether mTORC represses translation of Kv1.1, as suggested by our preliminary data.
In Aim 3, we bring together the cellular and molecular findings to determine the effects of WD-mediated
changes to network excitability and seizure susceptibility in vivo. Using a novel optogenetic approach, we will
test whether stimulation of the thalamo-HC pathway during WD will elicit enhanced epileptiform activity
compared to controls that will depend on patterned activity at facilitated CA1 synapses. We expect that
disruptions of mTORC1 will modify or reverse WD-mediated excitability. Seizure threshold is significantly
reduced during repeated EtOH WD and we will use this fact to test the hypothesis that drugs effective against
WD-induced hyper-excitability will also be effective at raising seizure thresholds to baseline levels. Success in
these experiments will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how brief spindle episodes and spike
wave complexes promote or support tonic-clonic WD seizures – which could lead to the identification of novel
pathways and associated drug targets that will provide a means to prevent WD seizure, and to more effectively
treat it."

Food allergy (FA) is a growing public health concern. The effects of maternal immune responses on the induction
of regulatory T (Treg) cell-mediated food tolerance in offspring are poorly understood. We found that maternal
“protective” sensitization with allergen [ovalbumin (OVA) or peanut] prevented FA responses in murine offspring
in response to epicutaneous sensitization and oral challenge with the same allergen, as indicated by a decrease
in the levels of food anaphylaxis, allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E, serum mouse mast cell proteinase 1,
and intestinal mast cell expansion. Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-dependent transfer of maternal IgG and allergen
immune complexes (IgG-IC) via milk and IgG-IC presentation by neonatal CD11c+ cells induced allergen-specific
Treg cells in offspring. Offspring of unsensitized mothers fostered by OVA-sensitized mothers or maternal IgG-
IC supplementation induced neonatal tolerance. Consistently, human milk from non-atopic mothers contained
IgG-IC and induced tolerance in humanized FcRn mice. These results indicate that maternal milk IgG-IC-FcRn
axis establishes Treg cell-mediated neonatal food tolerance, which may extend to humans. As an extension of
our prior study, the goals of this proposal are the previously underinvestigated mechanisms by which additional
milk factor (microbiota) besides IgG-ICs in a specific preweaning interval during lactation critically regulate the
induction of retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor γt (Rorγt)+ Treg cell-mediated neonatal tolerance
against FA. Selective deletion of
Rorc, the gene encoding Rorγt, in
Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3)+ Treg cells
predisposes to FA in wild-type (WT) mice.
Offspring of OVA-sensitized WT mothers show higher frequencies of
OVA-specific Rorγt+ Treg cells as compared to controls. Il4raF709 mice, a murine model of FA, carry a gain-of-
function mutation in the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor (IL-4R) α chain allele. Il4raF709 offspring of OVA-sensitized
Il4raF709 mothers showed failure of tolerance towards FA as compared to controls in the presence of IgG-IC,
associated with decreased frequencies of Rorγt+ Treg cells. Bacteriotherapy with Clostridiales or Bacteroidales
species induced Rorγt+ Treg cells that suppressed FA in Il4raF709 mice, suggesting that Rorγt+ Treg cells mediate
protection against FA and that pro-atopic genotype may hinder the optimal induction of neonatal tolerance
through the reprogramming of Rorγt+ Treg cells
. Offspring of OVA-sensitized germ-free mothers and offspring of
OVA-mothers treated with antibiotics during the lactation period failed to show protection against FA, even in the
presence of IgG-IC. Our pilot study identified the differences in milk bacterial taxa and human milk
oligosaccharides between non-atopic and FA groups. These results imply that the maternal microbiota during
the lactation period is necessary to successfully induce neonatal food tolerance. We hypothesize that newly
developed allergen-specific Rorγt+ Treg cells in the neonatal gut suppress Th2 responses to food allergen, and
that this process is compromised by high Th2 signaling. We also hypothesize that the maternal microbiota during
the lactation period shape the neonatal gut microbiota that induce the Treg cell-mediated neonatal food tolerance."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects >35% of older adults in the US. It is now the primary etiology
of chronic liver disease and liver cancer, and the driver of the recent upward trend in these lethal diseases. A
dysbiotic gut microbiome has been associated with NAFLD, but mostly in small-scale, cross-sectional or clinic-
based studies. Population-based longitudinal studies are needed to provide evidence for the temporal
relationship of the gut microbiome with the progression of NAFLD. In the cross-sectional Multiethnic Cohort
(MEC) Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS; P01 CA168530), we showed a significant difference in gut microbial
composition and inferred microbial function by NAFLD status, including enrichment of Fusobacterium and
endotoxin-producing bacteria and altered microbial pathways for bile acid and simple carbohydrate metabolism
in NAFLD. We now hypothesize that specific gut bacterial features (genera, metabolic pathways and blood
endotoxin biomarker lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)) are associated with increase in liver fat and liver
fibrosis over time. We also hypothesize that several dietary factors are associated with NAFLD progression
and that fibrosis-promoting gut bacterial features mediate these associations. We propose a longitudinal
investigation by efficiently adding a ~10-year follow-up assessment among 300 of the MEC-APS participants,
aged 60-77 years at baseline and of three racial/ethnic groups (Japanese American, Native Hawaiian or
White), across a wide range of baseline liver fat. We will re-assess liver fat using MRI and measure liver
stiffness using MR elastography, gold-standard methods for non-invasive quantification of liver fat and liver
stiffness, respectively, and perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing (follow-up stool samples) and metagenomic
sequencing (baseline and follow-up stool samples). Specific Aims are to: 1) evaluate the change in specific gut
bacterial features (abundance of genera, metabolic pathways, and LBP) over time in relation to the change in
liver fat; 2) evaluate the change in gut bacterial features over time in relation to (2a) liver stiffness at follow-up
and (2b) change in a blood biomarker panel for liver fibrosis (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score), and (2c)
validate the top two bacterial features associated with liver stiffness using ddPCR; and 3) assess the
association of diet (3 dietary pattern scores for overall diet quality and 7 key components) with ELF-based
change in liver fibrosis and explore the mediation by fibrosis-promoting gut bacterial features from Aim 2,
stratified by liver fat level. Our results will identify gut microbial features associated with early NAFLD
progression, while specifically addressing the needs of understudied Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians
(NOT-HL-23-001), two high-risk populations for NAFLD and liver cancer. The strengths of the proposed
longitudinal design and rigorous imaging and laboratory methods will aid in understanding NAFLD progression
involving the gut microbiome. These findings may be used to inform novel targeted intervention strategies to
prevent NAFLD progression and, ultimately, reduce liver cancer burden in multiple racial/ethnic populations."
10877092,"ABSTRACT
In 2019, approximately 268,600 women in the US will be diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the leading
cause of cancer in women. About 25% of these cases occurred in premenopausal women. The annual
incidence of breast cancer among women under age 50 has been increasing slowly since the mid-1990s, in
contrast to what is observed in women aged over 50 years, where the incidence has remained stable over
time. This persistent increase in the incidence among younger women indicates that new approaches to
primary prevention in premenopausal women are needed. Mammographic breast density is one of the
strongest risk factors for breast cancer, especially in premenopausal women, where an estimated 39% of
breast cancer cases is attributable to having dense breasts. A decrease in breast density leads to a reduction
in breast cancer incidence. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of mammographic breast density and the
mechanisms through which dense breast increases breast cancer risk are poorly understood. A greater
understanding of these mechanisms is crucial, and will uncover new biological pathways and actionable
biomarkers that can be targeted to prevent breast cancer development. Metabolomics is a promising tool to
provide novel insights into disease etiology, biological mechanisms, and pathways. Metabolomics has,
however, not been applied to study mammographic breast density. Our pilot analyses show differences in
metabolite levels between women with fatty breasts compared to women with dense breasts. Building on these
novel findings, we will apply state-of-the art metabolomics platforms to 1) investigate the metabolome of
mammographic breast density in premenopausal women; 2) quantify the variation in mammographic breast
density explained by the metabolome; 3) determine whether the metabolome of mammographic breast density
predicts breast cancer development in premenopausal women. Our overarching hypothesis is that we will
leverage metabolomics to uncover the molecular mechanisms, biological pathways, as well as novel actionable
biomarkers that are associated with mammographic breast density in premenopausal women. Our study
population will consist of premenopausal women recruited during annual screening mammogram at the Joanne
Knight Breast Health Center at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO. Mammographic
breast density is quantitatively assessed using Volpara. Fasting blood samples are collected on the same day
the women have their mammograms. The women also complete a questionnaire with detailed information on
breast cancer risk factors and determinants of mammographic density. In conclusion, we will build on our
exciting preliminary data to uncover novel, actionable biomarkers associated with mammographic breast
density, and also breast cancer development in premenopausal women. These biomarkers could be targeted
in breast cancer prevention in future studies."

The combination of caloric restriction and exercise is the most common first-line treatment for obesity-related
disorders, yet we know very little about the synergistic effects of these two very different treatments. A deeper
understanding about mechanisms underlying the health benefits of adding exercise to a weight loss program is
critical for optimizing modifiable components of lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise intensity). Importantly,
although a reduction in adipose tissue mass is the fundamental adaptation to weight loss, we know almost
nothing about the effects that adding exercise may have on structural and functional changes within adipose
tissue. This is very important because many obesity-related metabolic health complications are tightly linked with
abnormalities in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT). In particular, high rates of fatty acid release
from aSAT, which is very common in obesity, leads to ectopic lipid deposition in liver, visceral adipose tissue,
and skeletal muscle, and is a major factor underlying insulin resistance. Therefore, increasing the capacity of
aSAT to store and sequester fatty acids will protect against these abnormalities. Importantly, increased capacity
of aSAT to store fat does not translate to increased body fat mass, this requires an energy surplus. Based on
our exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize exercise triggers key signaling pathways in aSAT to reprogram
the regulation of angiogenesis, adipogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrosis to remodel aSAT for more
effective energy storage. We contend these exercise-induced modifications in aSAT will impart persistent health
benefits even if some weight is regained after weight loss. Finally, although high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
is known to induce robust cardio-metabolic improvements in adults with obesity, little known about the metabolic
impact of adding HIIT to a weight loss program. Comparing HIIT vs. more “conventional” moderate-intensity
continuous training (MICT) will provide important insights to optimize exercise protocols for adults with obesity.
General study design: Obese adults will be randomized to: 1) MICT, 2) HIIT or 3) no exercise (NoEX) - while
they all undergo a standardized calorie restricted diet until they lose 10% body weight. After losing 10% body
weight, all subjects will enter a 6-month follow-up phase (no diet or exercise requirements). Because long-term
adaptations to training largely stem from the accrual of responses to each exercise session, in Aim #1, we will
assess changes in signaling events involved in regulating aSAT angiogenesis, adipogenesis, ECM remodeling,
and inflammatory pathways, during the 24 hours after a session of exercise (HIIT and MICT). In Aim #2, we will
determine the effects of adding exercise training (MICT or HIIT) to a calorie-restricted weight-loss program on
changes in aSAT morphology (e.g., capillarization, ECM fibrotic content and composition, cell size, macrophage
infiltration) and cell-specific changes (via snRNA-seq) after 10% body weight loss. In Aim #3, during the 6-month
period after losing 10% body weight, we will compare weight loss maintenance, aSAT morphology, and relevant
clinical metabolic health outcomes among subjects originally randomized to MICT, HIIT, or NoEX."
10877094,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The future of dental education and support for biomedical research require investment in the selection and
training of tomorrow's scientists, including basic, translational and clinical researchers. One of the stated goals
of the NIDCR is to “ensure that a diverse network of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate
scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs”. In an effort to
achieve this goal, we are seeking renewal of our NIDCR-sponsored Institutional Training Program in Oral
Health Research, which provides an array of training opportunities in craniofacial health research. This grant
thus requests support to provide education and intensive, integrated research training for a select cadre of
scholars seeking either a PhD degree or postdoctoral training (for both DDS/MD and PhD graduates) with a
major focus on dental, oral and craniofacial health and disease. Only the most highly qualified and motivated
predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates will be selected for T90/R90 support. The T90 and R90 award
components will allow us to continue to train U.S. citizens and permanent residents as well as non-permanent
residents, who bring a global perspective. International scholars, clinician-scientists and underrepresented
minorities have made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to dental and craniofacial research
and teaching, serving as outstanding role models. We will continue to emphasize selection of qualified,
exceptional candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to further enhance diversity in the biomedical
workplace. At a time when inclusion and understanding have never been more important, fostering a diverse
cohort of academic researchers is a core component of our mission to prepare this next generation of leaders.
Outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees will be interviewed and chosen by an Internal Steering
Committee (ISC) for an initial 12-month period of support, and provided they demonstrate satisfactory
progress, will be awarded support for another 12 months. Program oversight will be from the Principal
Investigator and Co-Investigator, the ISC, and an advisory External Steering Committee (ESC). Trainee
mentors will be primarily tenured faculty from either the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry (Ostrow) or the
Keck School of Medicine (Keck) of USC. Mentors have been selected using two simple criteria: 1) they
maintain active research profiles and have a significant history of successful mentorship, and/or 2) they have
current independent research funding from the NIDCR, which serves as a strong indication that their research
interests are in alignment with the stated goals of the NIDCR. During the T90/R90 appointment period trainees
will enroll in grant writing classes, attend seminars and workshops, and submit a competitive peer-reviewed
grant application. Both Ostrow and the Provost's Office at USC remain fully committed to this and similar
federally supported NRSA training grants, and will ensure that additional financial support is in place to achieve
all stated outcomes."

This is a renewal application to the NICHD-funded Genetics of Male Infertility Initiative (GEMINI) established
under R01HD078641. In the past funding period, we added key knowledge to our understanding of Mendelian
forms of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Through GEMINI, we have successfully navigated the intricacies
of establishing and engaging valuable clinical collaborators, exceeding recruitment goals. In addition, we have
developed and refined powerful software to map genetic causes for n=1 cases of NOA, and in so doing have
successfully identified a large number of novel loss-of-function variants responsible for the disease.
Characterization of the underlying genetic basis for severe spermatogenic impairment is critical for its
implications in improving diagnosis and treatment in reproductive medicine. Improved understanding of genetic
causes of male infertility may have broader implications for the health of affected men. Abundant
epidemiological data indicate that male infertility is a risk factor of developing other comorbidities including
various types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and overall reduced general health. While we expect
that GEMINI will continue to uncover new infertility mutations with diverse methods of action, we will unify our
research in this cycle around the central theme of “comorbidity”. We hypothesize that the epidemiological
association between male infertility and diseases such as cancer may be caused by variants underlying
spermatogenic impairment and the increased burden of mutations in infertile men. The central goal of the
project is to continue to identify new Mendelian forms of severe spermatogenic impairment and additional
alleles in known and suspected male infertility genes. This genetic discovery will be driven by exome
sequencing of a new cohort of 1000 men with severe spermatogenic impairment and 1000 men with normal
semen parameters. Drawing upon lessons from the first phase of GEMINI, we are proposing a number of
additions to our approach, including new statistical methods and functional assays of primary tissue from
cases, and new collaborations for replication and model organism studies. We will apply the analytical tools
developed under R01HD078641 to identify potential infertility variants from publicly available genomes,
including over 500,000 that will be available through the UK Biobank (UKBB), the eMERGE Network, and the
Utah Genome Project (UGP). The rich phenotypic resources from these biobanks will be used to perform both
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and more targeted analyses to identify genetic links between
infertility and both known and novel comorbidities. Successful completion of these aims will significantly
improve our understanding of the genetic basis for spermatogenic impairment and the basis for the observed
relationship between male infertility and other comorbidities, with the overarching goals of improving male
infertility diagnosis and treatment as well as improving our capacity to risk-stratify infertile men based on their
likelihood of developing specific comorbidities later in life."

The Water Equity Science Shop (CEC-WESS) of the UC Berkeley Superfund Research Center seeks to
address drinking water quality problems in California that exist despite sophisticated statewide water
infrastructure and federal and state water quality laws. Industrial and agricultural activities in the state have led
to elevated levels of chemical contaminants in drinking water such as nitrate, arsenic, pesticides, and CrVI.
Among socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, degraded infrastructure, and a lack of resources to
treat contamination result in drinking water that does not meet regulatory standards for health and safety.
Residents served by water systems with fewer than 5 service connections and those using private wells face
even greater challenges, as these systems are not regulated under existing drinking water laws and little
monitoring exists to evaluate contamination problems. The fact that communities with elevated contaminants in
their drinking water are largely low income and disproportionately Latinx raises environmental justice concerns.
 The CEC-WESS will expand its impactful work to address these water equity challenges by leveraging the
biomedical and water quality engineering expertise of Berkeley Center to support the priorities of community-
based non-governmental organizations and agency stakeholders working to achieve the goals of CA’s Human
Right to Water law. The overall approach of the CEC-WESS draws on our prior success at undertaking
community-based participatory research that elucidates sustainable and socially-just strategies to improve
drinking water quality in partnership with community-based organizations throughout the research process. In
partnership with the Community Water Center (CWC), the CEC-WESS will significantly expand CWC’s
Drinking Water Tool (DWT), an interactive web-based tool, that identifies communities vulnerable to challenges
in meeting CA’s Human Right to Water. We will develop and integrate new data layers to identify drinking
water threats from PFAS sources (e.g., airports, landfills), agricultural pesticide applications, Superfund sites,
CAFOS and other sources (Aim 1). This enhanced DWT will be disseminated to agency stakeholders and
communities, and leveraged to identify candidate communities for enrollment in a household tap water study
conducted through Center Project 1. The CEC-WESS will also support agency efforts to track and evaluate
Human Right to Water efforts through creation of community-informed metrics of drinking water quality and
accessibility among domestic well communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop interactive data tools for water
justice organizations and domestic well communities including a free online tool, “What’s in My Well Water? to
help individual domestic well owners interpret their water testing results and learn how to reduce exposure to
harmful contaminants (Aim 3). Our proposed work will fill key knowledge gaps regarding drinking water quality
threats, elucidate effective solutions for domestic well and community water system users, and empower
environmental justice communities to take action to reduce their exposure and health risks."
10877961,"CORE C: SUMMARY
The Center investigators seek to understand and remediate potential health risks posed by complex exposure
scenarios present at hazardous waste sites using a systems approach. Several of the proposed projects will use
cutting-edge analytical chemistry, sequencing and other approaches to produce high-dimensional “omic” data
with thousands of parallel measurements on a specific endpoint. These data will be analyzed to identify biological
processes that are perturbed in complex environmental exposure scenarios. The Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC) will support the all aspects of the scientific data process: from statistical design, data
management and QA/QC to providing high performance computing platforms, with secure access to Center
data, consulting on data science, biostatistical analysis, to development of new methodology and its
dissemination for project goals. The DMAC will thus support the acquisition, storage, analysis, and sharing of
large, complex datasets through the development of tools, infrastructure and expertise. It will develop data-
driven, machine-learning methods to find patterns in high-dimensional data sets in order to understand biological
perturbations and potential health risks associated with exposures. These efforts include proposals for new
statistical algorithms (and resulting software) on discovering which patterns of chemical mixtures have greatest
potential human health impacts. As these methods require a lot of computing power, Core C leaders will work
with the Berkeley Research Computing group to provide a platform for computation that provides for fast scalable
solutions, as the resulting system will have over 100 CPU’s. This platform will also have direct access through
the integration with Box file management system. Finally, the DMAC will manage access to Center data,
metadata, analysis plans and other supporting material releases using the Open Scientific Framework (osf). In
conclusion, Core C is an integral and critical component of the overall program that supports the whole life history
of Center data."
10877962,"CORE D (RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING COORDINATION CORE): SUMMARY
Trainees are critical to achieving the overall goals of the Berkeley SRP Center related to our central theme:
“Systems approach to address the complex problems associated with Superfund contaminants”. Trainee
research—in environmental health, environmental science, environmental engineering, and data science—will
help to quantify perinatal and childhood exposures; protect disadvantaged communities from exposures;
understand the totality of chemicals to which communities are exposed; account for interactions among
mixtures of chemicals at hazardous waste sites and in health impact assessment; and develop novel chemical-
biological approaches to remediate chemicals in situ and persistent chemicals resistant to traditional methods.
To best address these complex problems, the objectives of the Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core (RETCC, Core D) are to recruit Trainees with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and skills
(Aim 1); foster cross-disciplinary fluency and training and interdisciplinary research opportunities within the
Berkeley SRP, and among West-Coast SRP Centers, to address real-world problems (Aim 2); coordinate
opportunities for trainee participation in research translation and community engagement training and activities
(Aim 3); provide professional development training and opportunities to develop skills needed to participate in,
and lead, multidisciplinary teams to address complex environmental problems (Aim 4); and, evaluate training
activities and provide information on trainee accomplishments to the SRP (Aim 5). Through interaction with all
other Cores and research Projects, RETCC will provide all trainees with a holistic training experience to
increase understanding and engagement in the overall goals and SRP mandates, foster interdisciplinary skills
and mindset, and increase social and cultural awareness of the affected communities in the context of SRP
and California’s Human Right to Water Law. We will leverage campus resources and the expertise of SRP
faculty, alumni, and stakeholders to provide a unique and dynamic curriculum that includes bi-weekly seminars
and workshops on a range of topics related to Berkeley SRP goals, hands-on training, projects, and cross-
mentoring, interdisciplinary classes such as Health Risk Assessment, Green Chemistry and Riskscapes and
Environmental Justice. We will promote and support hands-on activities such as planning a virtual forum to
foster interdisciplinary research among Centers; the preparation of outreach materials and videos; engagement
with stakeholders and communities on projects; networking with alumni and professionals in a wide range of
related fields; and leadership in NIEHS’s SPAN and other organizations. We will encourage our trainees to
participate in the NIEHS Annual Meeting and other meetings and to apply for honors and awards including the
SRP KC Donnelly Externship Program, SRP Karen Wetterhahn Memorial Award and the Berkeley Big Data
Fellowship. We anticipate recruiting 27 trainees: 12 postdocs (2.5 years); 6 MS students (2 years); and 9 PhD
students (4-5 years) and our goal is to double the percentage of URM Trainees to 18% (5 Trainees)."

The mission of this NCI Youth Enjoy Science Training in Health Equity, Highlighting Environmental Inequities, &
Growing neighborHood Teachers and Students (YES in THE HEIGHTS) program at the Herbert Irving
Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) is to reduce the cancer burden and cancer health inequities in the
HICCC Catchment Area (CA) through training and mentoring of students and teachers to increase the diversity
of future cancer researchers. Our program is grounded on the commitment to address multiple levels cancer
causes starting from the social determinants of health (SDoH) and community, household, and individual
chemical and physical environmental exposures that interact with lifestyle and underlying susceptibility. Our
approach emphasizes multiple levels of causation with multiple levels of risk reduction and modification across
the life course including the following themes: (1) SDoH as drivers of cancer health inequities; (2) Multiple levels
of interventions to address the inequities through research, training and dissemination at the community, school,
family and individual level; and (3) Life course approaches to cancer risk reduction that incorporates health
ambassador and citizen scientist approaches and engages high school and undergraduate students in
community relevant health education and field work. We are excited by the opportunity to expand the HICCC
CURE Program through research experiences (Goal 1), curriculum development (Goal 2), and outreach and
engagement (Goal 3). We will continue our commitment to mentoring students in minority-serving institutions,
including students from nearby City University of New York (CUNY), the largest minority-serving undergraduate
university in the U.S. We have also designed the YES in THE HEIGHTS program with novel pedagogical and
experiential training in cancer health inequities and basic science for grade 9-12 science teachers within the Math
and Science for America (MfA) Program. Across all five years, YES in THE HEIGHTS will mentor, train and
engage over 1,125 individuals within the communities we serve. To accomplish these goals, our program will be
grounded on 5 key principles: (1) It takes a village to guide under-represented students through to academic
success; (2) Active mentorship; (3) Foundational training; (4) Team science research; and (5) Program
evaluation. The MPIs Terry and McDonald have successfully run the HICCC CURE program since 2015 and
have extensive background in teaching and mentoring recognized as Mentor of the Year at Mailman School of
Public Health (MSPH) and CU Presidential Teaching Award, respectively. They are joined by a diverse group of
faculty members who have offered to serve as mentors for this R25 program, including 50% women, 21%
underrepresented minority and with diverse areas of expertise including exposure sciences, toxicology,
environmental and molecular epidemiology, participatory research methods and environmental justice, and
biomedical sciences. YES in THE HEIGHTS expands the proven success of HICCC CURE which has trained 50
students since 2015 in research laboratory experiences and over 400 students in online scientific enrichment."

Synaptic inhibition in the brain is mostly mediated by GABAergic inhibitory synapses, which are essential in
controlling neuronal firing, neuron and circuit excitability, and synaptic plasticity. Inhibitory synapses undergo
multiple modes of plasticity but the molecular mechanisms that drive persistent inhibitory post-synaptic plasticity
remain poorly defined. As translation of synaptic proteins is essential for many forms of plasticity, synthesis of
new inhibitory post-synaptic proteins likely plays a key role in sustaining changes in inhibitory synaptic strength.
However, little is known about which inhibitory synaptic proteins are translated, where they are produced and
how this process is regulated during activity. Our preliminary work suggests that multiple inhibitory synaptic
proteins are locally translated in neuronal dendrites during inhibitory long-term potentiation. This process is tightly
regulated by miRNAs, potent negative-regulators of translation. This proposal will examine the control of
inhibitory synaptic plasticity by local miRNA-dependent translational regulation, using in vivo and in vitro
advanced imaging and electrophysiological approaches. The proposed studies are significant as they have the
potential to reveal key mechanisms that drive persistent and long-lasting changes in synaptic inhibition. Given
the important roles of inhibitory synapses in the brain, this project will provide crucial insight into the underlying
mechanisms of learning, memory and cognition."

This proposal is submitted in response to FOA RFA-DK-21-022, to serve as a Genetics Research Center (GRC),
within the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. During the present period, we made substantive progress in defining
mechanisms of anti-TNF non-response in ileal Crohn’s disease and defined the role of NOD2 mutations in
altering blood monocyte differentiation to result in an aberrant myeloid-stromal niche. In this proposal, we seek
to expand on the role of blood monocyte differentiation, but newly-focused on perianal fistulae, a major unmet
medical need in Crohn’s disease, disproportionately affecting African-Americans. Single cell transcriptomics has
provided enormous insight into molecular mechanisms in IBD; our lab has substantial expertise in this and will
leverage new approaches including multiome ATAC + transcriptome and higher resolution spatial
transcriptomics platforms available soon. Aim 1 will focus on direct ex-vivo single cell analyses involving perianal
fistulae including African-American and European ancestry Crohn’s disease patients. Aim 2 will expand in vitro
analyses focusing on rectal-derived enteroids and serial blood leukocyte and platelet analyses. Both epithelial
cells and monocytes can differentiate into mesenchymal-type cells. The extent to which stem- and other
pluripotent cells are imprinted with chronic inflammation and during acute flares vs. remission will be evaluated
via multiome ATAC + transcriptome and serial blood leukocyte and platelet analyses. Comparative analyses of
these multi-omic data across European vs. African-American cohorts focused on GWAS loci will be performed,
focusing on WNT, AP-1 and reactive oxygen species’ effects. Iterating between direct ex-vivo data (Aim 1) and
in vitro systems (Aim 2) will provide maximal insight. Aim 3 describes our proposed contributions to the IBDGC
broadly. We have been major contributors to Consortium-wide clinical recruitment efforts (ileal resection,
ulcerative colitis demarcation), and more recently, recruitment of African-American and Hispanic IBD patients.
We have reported on the particular value of African-American case-control reference data for both common
(improving polygenic risk scores) and rare (overlap with very-early onset IBD genes) genetic variants. Beyond
perianal Crohn’s disease, new recruitment of ulcerative colitis patients hospitalized with acute flares is proposed;
serial blood analyses are feasible, with key short-term outcomes. A complete explication of mechanisms
underlying IBD locus associations will require deeper genomic interrogation across populations, as well as data
integration across space (cellular niches, disease extent), key clinical scenarios and time."
10884439,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fatal disease with an overall 5-year survival of <9%.
Progress in PDAC lags behind other cancers and there is a tremendous need to better understand the etiology
of PDAC in order to develop early diagnostic methods and better treatments. Pancreatic carcinogenesis is
driven by inflammation. Established risk factors for pancreatic cancer include chronic pancreatitis, diabetes,
obesity, and smoking, each associated with an inflammatory mechanism. However, these risk factors do not
fully explain the majority of pancreatic cancer cases. Emerging evidence suggests that variation in our ‘other
genome’—the collective genome of the microorganisms inhabiting our body, known as the microbiome—may
have an even greater role than the human genome variations in the pathogenesis of cancer. Recent discoveries
suggest that bacteria are likely to influence this process by activating immune receptors and perpetuating
cancer-associated inflammation. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the interaction between
inflammation and the microbiota in the development of this deadly disease.
 We propose to characterize the microbiota in saliva, stool, and pancreatic tissue from patients with chronic
pancreatitis and PDAC using next-generation sequencing protocols. We will characterize microbiota present in
the saliva, stool, and pancreatic tissue from each subject aiming to find correlative microbial signatures across
multiple body sites.
 The Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is a
world leader in the study of the microbiome with innovative approaches and thus is ideally suited to coordinate
this study. In addition, the Elkins Pancreas Center (EPC) at BCM is eminently suited to be a collaborative
member of a national pancreatic research consortium. The EPC will provide access to a large population of
patients with pancreatitis and PDAC, and considerable experience in collaboration for the conduct of clinical
trials, sophisticated prospective data collection, and access to a mature tissue repository for studies proposed
by the Consortium.
 This project is timely and highly relevant to the goals of the NIH Roadmap and the NIH Human Microbiome
Project. This novel approach will allow us to create a pathogenic model for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic
cancer that will offer innovative strategies for prevention, biomarkers for early detection, and targets for
intervention."

Most, if not all, cognitive functions require the coordination of multiple brain regions. The ability to simultaneously
monitor neural activity across multiple brain regions in cellular resolution and high speed during natural behavior
is important to study how different parts of the brain work together to support behavior. Doing so requires the
recording device to have a high spatiotemporal resolution over a large field of view, and be sufficiently light and
compact so it can remain stable on the animal’s head while the animal freely behaves. Optical methods are
especially promising to fulfill all these requirements. However, existing optical miniaturized microscopes have
tradeoffs among the field of view, resolution, and device footprint. To achieve fine resolutions, most of the existing
miniaturized microscopes can only image a sub-millimeter scale field of view.
We propose to develop a miniaturized imager that can record neuronal activity in near-cellular resolution over
the entire cranium in freely-behaving mice. We have previously demonstrated a miniaturized 3D microscope
where all bulk lenses are replaced by a thin layer of microlens array. The microlens array effectively splits the
entire field of view into different regions, and uses different lens units to image them in parallel. A computational
algorithm is then used to reconstruct and synthesize the 3D volume. This approach enables high-resolution
imaging over a large 3D volume through a thin device. Our microscope achieved <10 µm lateral resolution over
4x6 mm2 field of view, and can reconstruct 3D volume across ~600 µm depth range with ~50 µm axial resolution
from a single 2D captured image. In this project, we will optimize and expand the microlens array so it could
image neural activity across the entire cranium (~9x10 mm2) and 400 µm depth in near-cellular resolution in
freely-behaving mice. We will package the image sensor, microlens array, and illumination optics into a compact
device. We will develop deep-learning-based algorithms that can faithfully reconstruct neuronal activity over the
3D cortical volume from recordings that are highly corrupted by light scattering in real time. Compared to existing
algorithms, our approach can significantly reduce the required computational resources and processing time.
Our miniaturized imager enables the investigation of very large-scale neuronal circuits distributed across the
cortex. We will run testbed experiments on both freely-moving mice and head-unrestrained macaque monkeys,
two important animal models for studying the neural basis of behavior. We will leverage well-established
experimental paradigms, including passive viewing of visual stimuli and navigation in open arenas. These
experiments will serve to validate, benchmark, and further refine our techniques in vivo. The cross-species
experiments will not only prove the potential of our imager, but also provide critical insights into how animal
behavior emerges from the orchestration of individual neurons in large-scale neural circuits. This development
and validation of this new technology will pave the way for many exciting future experiments, and greatly enhance
our ability to address important neuroscience questions that are challenging with the existing techniques."

Hyperinflammatory gene expression upon tissue injury is a major health risk and the cause of significant
morbidity and mortality, particularly if it occurs in the lung. The polarization and injury-responsiveness of
macrophages (MF) is tightly regulated to ensure proper control of homeostatic, inflammatory, anti-inflammatory
and regenerative processes. The transcriptional and epigenomic determinants of (hyper)responsiveness are
poorly understood. We have recently determined that the nuclear hormone receptor, Peroxisome Proliferator
Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR) is part of a transcription factor cascade in Interleukin (IL)4 polarized MFs,
downstream of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)6 induced Early Growth Regulator
(EGR)2. Remarkably, PPAR proved to have ligand-dependent, but also apparently ligand-independent,
epigenomic activities controlling alternative polarization. In addition, we can show that IL-4 polarized MFs
establish a unique epigenome and inflammatory gene expression program upon Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-ligand
exposure. A newly identified part of this interaction, we termed extended synergy, is dependent on the expansion
of Nuclear Factor (NF)κB-p65 cistrome and increased enhancer activity. The previously alternatively polarized
MFs produce immune-modulatory factors, including Chemokine (C-C) Ligand (CCL) 2, IL6 at an extremely high
level in vitro and in vivo in a murine Th2-type airway inflammation and lung injury model upon lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) exposure leading to exacerbation of the response. The extended synergy and the LPS response of several
genes, including Ccl2 and Il6, depend on the presence of PPAR and some can be modulated by its synthetic
and selective ligand, Rosiglitazone. We hypothesize that PPAR acts as signal-dependent epigenomic
bookmark, selecting and safeguarding enhancers during MF-extended synergistic inflammatory gene expression
by modulating the amplitude of the response. The receptor acts via two distinct mechanisms (1) actively selecting
and inducing enhancers genome-wide and (2) also as epigenomic bookmarker and architectural factor altering
gene expression only upon non-cognate inflammatory signals. We are examining these hypotheses by
systematically mapping the transcriptional and epigenomic changes requiring PPAR, the receptor’s role in the
dynamically changing 3D chromatin architecture and in mouse models of lung injury, Th2 inflammation and the
combination of the two leading to a hyperinflammatory response leading to exacerbation of these disease
processes. Using cutting-edge epigenomics and transcriptomics technologies, with innovative genetic and
chimeric mouse models analyzed by high dimensional flow cytometry and single cell technologies will provide
mechanistic insights into this novel mode of action of the nuclear receptor PPAR and may lead to the
identification of novel pathways to alleviate lung injury and disease progression."
10880905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of Americans living with serious illness experience burdensome symptoms and receive aggressive
care that is not aligned with their goals and preferences. Palliative care, which entails a supportive approach to
care focused on maximizing quality of life, improves patient-centered, clinical, and economic outcomes for
patients living with serious illness. For this reason, national guidelines recommend that palliative care is
provided as part of standard serious illness care, and most hospitals in the U.S. have invested in specialist
palliative care programs. Yet, it has become clear that relying on clinicians to consistently recognize unmet
palliative care needs across different types of patients is impractical, and an important source of current
inefficiencies and inequities in hospital palliative care delivery, and systematic changes are needed. For this
reason, some hospitals have implemented screening criteria, or “triggers” in the electronic health record (EHR)
to facilitate more reliable and equitable patient identification; however, current diagnostic- and prognostic-
based criteria are nonspecific for unmet palliative care needs and exclude many patients with similar or greater
needs. Automating palliative care needs-based triggers surmounts these limitations, but evidence of their real-
world effectiveness to improve patient outcomes is needed. Further, it is not clear that a palliative care needs
trigger alone – which merely provides clinicians information – will be sufficient to meaningfully change clinician
behavior with regard to palliative care delivery. Thus, we hypothesize that a palliative care needs trigger in the
EHR will improve both patient-centered outcomes and the equity of palliative care delivery compared with
usual care, and that combining this trigger with an effective behavioral intervention (a default palliative care
consult order) will improve these outcomes further compared with the trigger alone. We will conduct a hybrid
type 1 pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial among more than 64,000 patients across 9 diverse hospitals to
study the effectiveness of these interventions on hospital-free days and numerous other patient-centered and
clinical outcomes, and the equity of palliative care consultation among different patient subgroups. During the
trial, we will conduct an embedded mixed-methods study to quantitively assess each intervention's reach,
adoption, implementation, and maintenance, and to qualitatively identify contextual factors and barriers to
enhance the interpretation of the trial findings and translation to other hospital settings. Our trial design has
several methodologic innovations, including a design that supports two randomized questions, a pre-planned
Bayesian interpretation, and newer effect modification methods. By providing high-quality, comparative
evidence of the real-world effectiveness, equity, and implementation of two scalable approaches to improve
hospital palliative care delivery and patient-centered outcomes, this study will have a significant impact on
palliative care research and practice, and will inform the optimal approach for other health systems to promote
desired clinician behavior change to improve serious illness care."

resource operations (SRO). Over the past 15 years, TX State has sustained a steady increase in biomedical
research capacity and undergraduate STEM matriculation leading to an increased need for strategic modern
scientific instruments investment to bolster the TX State education and research missions. The acquisition of
the proposed Zeiss Axio Observer 7 microscope will directly strengthen the research programs of three NIH-
supported researchers within the TX State Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and will enhance the
educational mission of the TX State Biology Department. It will bring new high-resolution imagining capabilities
for studying the basic science of microbes and cancer cell-culture models to the TX State campus. The
requested Zeiss Axio Observer 7 microscope will complement existing shared microscopy resources within the
SRO equipment portfolio while bringing new live-cell imaging and multicolor imaging capabilities to the TX
State research community. The latter will support the diverse (bio)material science and engineering training
programs at TX State. Between the research and teaching major users listed in the grant application, we
anticipate that >90 students/year will gain access to this instrument. This includes ~60 students/year in
microbiology-related laboratory coursework spanning the undergraduate and graduate levels and >25-30
student research trainees/year through engagement in independent research experiences. Through the
strategic placement of the instrument in the TX State SRO portfolio, we have guaranteed resources to facilitate
new user training, routine maintenance, scheduling, standard operation procedure
development/documentation, enforcing lab/equipment safety protocols, and in-depth user training for the life of
the instrument. This new instrument will provide long-term research and instructional resources to engage
students and research trainees in the hands-on operation of modern scientific equipment who are
underrepresented in the biomedical sciences at a resource-limited institution."

For individuals who use picture symbols to communicate (i.e., augmentative and alternative
communication/AAC), validated measures to characterize aided language productions currently do not exist.
Researchers and clinicians need to have confidence that when they measure a child’s language productions,
the measures they use accurately reflect the constructs of interest. Although many measures designed to
characterize spoken language development have been developed in recent decades, comparable
psychometrically sound language measures have never been systematically developed for aided
communication. Valid measures are required for accurate diagnosis, assessment, and progress monitoring. In
the absence of such measures, aided language researchers and clinicians resort to adapting spoken language
measures, but some of these measures do not accurately characterize the constructs of interest. Currently, this
lack of validated measures severely limits research and clinical practice for these “aided communicators.”
Therefore, a critical need exists to develop psychometrically sound measures of aided language acquisition.
Failing to conduct this research blocks advancement in rigorous AAC research, resulting in continued reliance
on psychometrically questionable measures. The long-term goal of this programmatic line of research is to
enhance language acquisition outcomes for aided communicators. The focus of the current proposal is to
systematically investigate the psychometric properties of a range of aided language measures, which are
based on our Graphic Symbol Utterance and Sentence Development Framework. Our central hypotheses
are: (1) psychometrically sound measures can be established to capture growth within and across different
dimensions of language acquisition, and (2) some elicitation contexts will be better than others at capturing
aided language growth. Specific Aim 1 identifies valid measures to characterize aided language progress. Aim
1A uses existing data to document the psychometric properties of a range of aided language measures for
preschoolers at the early stages of aided communication acquisition who have received 4 months of aided
language intervention. Aim 1B analyzes language progression for high-performing aided communicators who
will receive 24 months of intervention; this allows for investigation across all phases of early aided language
acquisition. Specific Aim 2 identifies elicitation contexts that demonstrate the most productive aided language
use. Achievement of the aims will result in measures that demonstrate strong reliability, differentiate growth for
different populations, describe different dimensions of language growth, and are clinically feasible. This work
will chart a new horizon of AAC research that contains valid measures to characterize aided language
acquisition for preliterate children with profound speech disorders."

Diabetes affects more than 34 million people in the US alone. It is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb 
amputation, largely due to the development of chronic diabetic wounds. While various therapies have been explored 
to treat diabetic wounds, effective treatment remains a challenge as current therapies cannot efficiently address the 
key intrinsic causes of slow diabetic wound healing, i.e., chronic inflammation, abnormal skin cell functions (particularly 
migration), and delayed angiogenesis. To address these causes, it is crucial to control TGFβ signaling. TGFβ1/p38 
pathway is directly associated with prolonged inflammation, and impaired cell migration in wounds. Meanwhile, 
TGFβ1/Smad2/3 pathway is required to regulate a critical cell type for wound healing, myofibroblasts. As such, 
inhibiting TGFβ1/p38 pathway without affecting TGFβ1/Smad2/3 pathway will simultaneously address the 3 
key intrinsic causes, leading to accelerated diabetic wound healing. However, this cannot be achieved by any 
existing approaches. 
In this project, we propose to create a new wound dressing to achieve the goal. It will consist of a peptide-based 
TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) inhibitor ECG, and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging hydrogel. The ECG will 
be gradually released from the hydrogel to continuously inhibit TGFβ1/p38 pathway so as to improve cell migration 
and decrease tissue inflammation. The enhanced endothelial cell migration will lead to accelerated angiogenesis. The 
hydrogel will scavenge upregulated ROS in the diabetic wounds to further decrease inflammation. Notably, ECG will 
not affect TGFβ1/Smad2/3 pathway under high glucose condition. To the best of our knowledge, none of the 
existing TGFβ receptor inhibitors have shown capability of inhibiting TGFβ1/p38 pathway without 
downregulating TGFβ1/Smad2/3 pathway.
In our preliminary study, application of a single dose of wound dressing into excisional wounds in young diabetic 
mice significantly accelerated wound closure. The wounds completely closed at day 14. In contrast, the wound size 
remained >53% for the hydrogel-treated, and untreated wounds. The wound dressing also decreased ROS content, 
M1 macrophage density and p-p38 expression, and increased vessel density in the wounds. These preliminary results 
demonstrate that ECG-releasing wound dressing is promising for diabetic wound healing. It is yet to test whether the 
wound dressing can promote diabetic wound healing under aged condition, as aging itself impairs cell migration and 
angiogenesis.
We hypothesize that the wound dressing based on ECG and ROS-scavenging hydrogel will significantly 
enhance skin cell migration, stimulate tissue angiogenesis, and decrease tissue inflammation, leading to 
accelerated healing of diabetic wounds under young and aged conditions. Aim #1 will test the hypothesis that 
optimal wound dressings will simultaneously scavenge ROS, increase skin cell migration, promote endothelial lumen 
formation, and attenuate inflammatory cytokine secretion under TGFβ and high glucose conditions. Aim #2 will test 
the hypothesis that the developed wound dressings will accelerate diabetic wound healing under young and aged 
conditions.
This project is innovative because the proposed wound dressings will simultaneously address the 3 key intrinsic 
hurdles for diabetic wounds to heal, by differentially regulating TGFβ signaling, i.e., inhibiting TGFβ1/p38 pathway,
while not affecting TGFβ1/Smad2/3 pathway that is essential for diabetic wound healing."

Human vision relies on rapid eye movements called saccades that occur a few times every
second. These saccades bring peripherally identified objects to the fovea for high resolution
inspection. This split-second sampling of the world defines the perception-action cycle of natural
vision and profoundly impacts perception. While much is known about the neural mechanisms
involved in the onset of this cycle, how targets are selected before saccades, virtually nothing is
known about how pre-saccadic representations would impact processing of post-saccadic
information about targets that now appear at the fovea. The proposed research addresses
fundamental questions about how pre- and post-saccadic visual information are combined
across saccades to maximize information for attended targets. Experiments will be performed in
the common marmoset, a New World primate whose smooth cortex affords advantages for
recording with high-density silicon arrays across cortical representations and in the longer term
for imaging and optogenetic manipulation of large scale neural circuits. In Aim 1, we will test if
pre-saccadic information is enhanced in early visual cortex to favor higher acuity information
that is most relevant to the fovea and thus could provide a “foveal preview” to prime post-
saccadic processing. In Aim 2 we test if pre-saccadic enhancement is target specific and
involves a selection of target features, such as orientation or motion. In Aim 3 we record from
foveal populations in early visual cortex to determine how pre-saccadic selection alters post-
saccadic processing, and specifically, if pre-saccadic feature selection of the target biases
processing to favor the continued selection of the target at the fovea based on increasing gain
for its features. This research will provide the first evaluation at the level of single neurons and
neural codes of post-saccadic foveal enhancement and the role of pre-saccadic target selection.
This has broader impacts for understanding attention under natural viewing conditions where
the eyes parse visual scenes, and more generally, for how sensory-motor predictions influence
visual perception."

Human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) continues to be an important human pathogen because it
infects two-thirds of the adults in the world. Following acute infection, HSV-1 establishes and
maintains life-long latency in neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG), and other neurons within
the central nervous system, including brainstem. External stressful stimuli periodically induce
reactivation from latency, which triggers virus transmission. HSV-1 reactivation from latency is
essential for virus transmission and recurrent disease: including ocular disease, encephalitis,
and congenital infections. The principal sensory nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract (Pr5) and
locus coeruleus (LC) regions of the brainstem receive afferent inputs (directly or indirectly) from
TG. Consequently, brainstem is a biologically relevant site for viral replication and reactivation
from latency. Our recent published study revealed wild-type (wt) HSV-1 and a latency
associated transcript (LAT) mutant, referred to as dLAT2903, preferentially induce expression of
neuroinflammatory and senescence markers in Pr5 of latently infected female, but not male
mice. Strikingly, dLAT2903, but not wild-type HSV-1, preferentially induces expression of
senescence and neuroinflammatory markers in LC of females, but not male mice. Pr5 contains
many motor neurons whereas LC primarily contains medium-sized neurons. LC is also
the principal site for norepinephrine synthesis in the brain. New studies suggest LAT
expression impairs neuroinflammation in latently infected TG neurons or productively infected
human astrocytes derived from brainstem. Based on these female dimorphic responses to
HSV-1 infection, we hypothesize that Pr5, LC, and TG of female mice are predisposed to
senescence, neuroinflammation, and potentially neurodegeneration during latency. To test our
hypothesis, two Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 studies will identify cellular genes
that regulate neuroinflammation in TG, Pr5, and LC during latency and localize LAT coding
sequences that impair neuroinflammation. Specific Aim 2 studies will identify senescent cells in
brainstem and test whether LAT impairs senescence and inflammation in cultured human
brainstem astrocytes. Completing these studies will provide insight into the mechanism by
which HSV-1 causes neuroinflammation, including how LAT mediates this process."
10886322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Laboratory mice exhibit underdeveloped immune systems which fail to accurately predict human
responses to challenges such as vaccination. Intentional exposure of these mice to environmental microbes
(creating “dirty” mice) through various approaches has been shown to confer effective maturation of the immune
system, but generally requires specialized facilities which are not widely available to the research community.
Rapid sequential infection with six murine viral pathogens, beginning in early life to mimic human viral exposures,
is sufficient to drive immune maturation and yields mice available for subsequent challenge at 10 weeks of age.
Viral pathogens selected include those frequently identified in and transferred from other “dirty” mouse models.
This rapid sequential infection regimen dramatically alters circulating immune cells as well as total serum
antibody and cytokine levels, and critically, also diminishes specific serum antibody responses to both
intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Intriguingly, the regimen also stimulates robust changes
in the endogenous bacterial microbiota. Thus, this sequential infection model mimics phenotypes observed in
other microbially-experienced mice and in human adults, and it can be readily implemented in standard animal
facilities without special containment protocols.
 In the studies proposed here, this sequential infection regimen will be further refined and simplified, and
the role of microbiota changes in immune maturation in this model will be explored. In Aim 1, the sufficiency and
necessity of combinations of and individual viral exposures to stimulate immune maturation will be defined.
Antibody responses to systemic and mucosal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as well as robust immunophenotypes
observed in the sequential infection model, will serve as key assays. In Aim 2, the effects of sequential infections
on the bacterial, viral and fungal microbiome will be defined, and the functional contributions of the endogenous
microbiota to immune maturation will be tested. Microbiome profiling, germ-free mice, and antibiotic treatment
with fecal transplants will be used to elucidate microbiota contributions. These studies will use established
approaches supported by extensive published and preliminary data to reveal the contributions of individual viral
pathogen exposures as well as endogenous microbial communities to immune maturation following the rapid
sequential infection regimen.
 Completion of this proposal will yield a simplified “dirty” mouse model that is tractable and affordable for
the majority of investigators studying infectious diseases, vaccine responses, or immune outcomes. Additionally,
the proposed experiments will address an important open question about the relative importance of the
endogenous microbiota versus specific viral pathogen exposures in immune maturation of “dirty” mice. Finally,
they will serve to provide novel insights into immune responses directed against mucosal vaccines, which may
have predictive value as this vaccination approach is increasingly implemented in humans."

This career development award will allow Dr. Nicholas Burgraff to establish an independent research career
dedicated to understanding the neurophysiological control of airway function and its intricate
interactions within neural networks that regulate respiration, with a pivotal focus on how various
pharmaceuticals, notably opioids, can disrupt these systems. This line of research is crucial as it addresses how
drugs may inadvertently contribute to potentially life-threatening complications like respiratory depression. The
training plan and research strategy outlined in this proposal, combined with Dr. Burgraff's experience in
translational physiology, respiration, and rhythm generation, positions him exceptionally well for success in this
endeavor. The primary sites of focus in this research are the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, Nucleus Tractus
Solitarius, and Nucleus Ambiguus, areas with significant influences on airway smooth muscle control and the
balance of autonomic regulation. We hypothesize that fentanyl disrupts this balance, favoring parasympathetic
dominance that leads to airway constriction. Additionally, the study aims to establish dual-action treatments
targeting both this constriction and rhythm disruptions without reversing opioid binding, offering a new paradigm
in opioid overdose interventions. This project will expand Dr. Burgraff’s prior training in electrophysiology and
whole animal physiology by incorporating cutting-edge techniques including retrograde viral tracing,
immunohistochemistry, optogenetics, and high-density neural recordings. Merging these methodologies will
allow Dr. Burgraff to leverage a multi-level approach to investigate the functional dynamics of fentanyl on
neuronal circuits controlling airway constriction and assess counteractive strategies. Building upon Dr. Burgraff's
preliminary results, the proposed research will pave the way for developing effective therapeutic strategies that
complement or replace conventional opioid reversal strategies. By shedding light on the specific neural circuits
and autonomic mechanisms underlying fentanyl-induced airway constriction, this project holds the potential to
significantly improve patient safety and outcomes in various medical scenarios where opioids are used, from
acute pain to long-term opioid therapy. This investigation thus aligns seamlessly with Dr. Burgraff's career
objectives, his pursuit of R01 funding, and his commitment to advancing the understanding and management of
complications associated with opioid use. To assist Dr. Burgraff in accomplishing the research and career
development objectives of this proposal, he will receive strong mentorship from Dr. Nino Ramirez, a distinguished
figure in respiratory rhythm generation with an impressive track record in mentorship. He will also be supported
by an advisory committee of established professors and attending physicians, all with expertise in the techniques
and translational relevancies that are integral to this proposal. With full institutional support and the additional
training, mentorship, and experience that this grant will provide, Dr. Burgraff will be positioned to successfully
compete for R01-funding and establish a high-impact independent research program in this critical area of study."

Despite
cancer
 impressive strides in conventional small molecule therapeutics and novel cancer immunotherapies,
continues to be a devastating disease. Certain cancers are refractory to available therapies, and
patients' responses show large individual variability. Cancer involves striking dysregulation of epigenetic
pathways, with pharmacological approaches targeting chromatin regulators in the clinic and under
development. There is also profound involvement of metabolic pathways in cancer, including fascinating
nuclear-localized metabolic enzymes. These paradigm-shifting pathways represent an entirely new avenue for
targeted therapies, with the potential to directly and specifically modulate cancer-related gene expression
programs. However, our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in cancer, especially as they connect
to nuclear metabolic pathways, remains in its infancy. Our history of groundbreaking research revealing
new chromatin biology and uncovering genomics and proteomics of the transcription factor p53, both in its role
as a crucial tumor suppressor and as a ruinous oncogene, underpins our proposed novel directions. In
addition, we have new findings of a chromatin-localized role of a cancer-linked metabolic enzyme directly
“fueling” a histone modifying enzyme. Utilizing this background, in this revised proposal, we propose to
investigate novel epigenetic regulation and its intersection with nuclear metabolism, using a variety of normal
and cancer cell lines, as well as translational mouse models of cancer. We will investigate pivotal
developmental- and disease-relevant DNA regulatory elements, called enhancers, which our published findings
expose as crucial in p53 function, but which remain understudied in both wildtype and mutant p53 function. In
addition, we have recently illuminated a

which presages potential new advancement in therapy. Taken together, our combined focus on roles and
interactions of epigenetics and metabolism related to cancer promises to delineate novel mechanisms
involved in tumor formation. This paradigm-shifting, multidisciplinary work will bridge separate but

from our research will guide much-needed future treatments and significantly benefit patient populations."

The use of 10-14 day continuous glucose monitors for diabetes management is a historical achievement in
modern diagnostics, but unfortunately it remains an isolated success despite acute needs for the real-time
monitoring of many other molecules across the broader field of human disease management (cardiac, drug
dosing, fertility, etc.). The limitation is that glucose sensors are enzymatic, limiting their generalizability to other
analytes (i.e., enzymes oxidize/reduce the target molecule). Unlike enzymatic sensors, electrochemical
aptamer-based (EAB) sensors are broadly generalizable, demonstrated by several examples of real-time, in-
vivo molecular monitoring at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations. Unfortunately, in-vivo device longevity
remains a significant challenge for the clinical adoption of EAB sensors.
EAB sensors conventionally use a monolayer of redox-tagged aptamers and alkylthiol blocking molecules on a
gold working electrode. These self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) rapidly degrade on gold electrodes in real
biofluids at body temperature of 37 °C. The mechanisms of degradation of EAB SAMs have not been well-
understood in complex biofluids, which then limits the ability to pursue techniques to improve longevity. Our
preliminary data now provides major insights into the true mechanisms of SAM degradation. With this improved
understanding of degradation, its is now feasible to pursue stable operation for at least 5 days. Multi-day
operation would then allow EABs to be credibly pursued for applications beyond glucose, and for the first time,
proper research could begin on resolving the next expected longevity bottlenecks that would likely prevent 1-2
week operation (e.g. fouling, nuclease attack, etc.).
The central hypothesis is that at minimum 5 day EAB sensor operation can be achieved through a blocking layer
with superior stability achieved by either (1) electrochemically stabilizing an alkylthiol blocking layer during sensor
fabrication, or (2) replacing an alkylthiol blocking layer with a inorganic dielectric film that has a similar density of
defects supporting efficient electron transfer. 5 day operation would provide a leap forward in clinical relevance,
and is 10-20X greater the typical limit of 6-12 hours. 5 day operation would then position the PI Heikenfeld to
pursue clinical research, and would ignite critically-needed partnerships with industry leaders in glucose sensors.
The PI Heikenfeld is a new NIH investigator, but is well-prepared to pursue this longevity breakthrough given his
deep expertise in biosensors, and his co-PI’s White and Porter’s expertise in EAB sensors and electrochemical
blocking layers."

 One of the fundamental problems in evolutionary biology is to understand the molecular genetic basis of
speciation. Recent advances in speciation research have improved our understanding of interspeciﬁc divergence,
but we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the molecular processes that diverge among incipient species.
In the handful of cases where the genetic mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been elucidated, these
invariably tackle late-evolving and/or hybrid dysfunction. This means that we still lack a general understanding
of the molecular processes that govern pre-zygotic reproductive barriers, even though these are often important
early in the speciation process.
 My lab will tackle this problem by identifying the molecular genetic basis of pre-zygotic and post-zygotic re-
productive isolation between members of the Drosophila virilis species sub-group. This species group provides
an especially unique opportunity to dissect the genetic and molecular mechanisms of pre-zygotic barriers, as
members of this group are prone to evolve these types of barriers quickly between species and even among
populations of the same species. Our overall approach integrates several strategies to answer the following
questions: What are the genetic mechanisms that cause reproductive isolation between species? Which molec-
ular and cellular processes are affected by divergence of these genetic mechanisms? What are the evolutionary
forces that drive divergence of the relevant genes between species? What is the landscape of natural genetic
variation within and between species that facilitates evolutionary divergence of these genes?
 The ﬁrst project within this proposal will focus on post-mating pre-zygotic barriers (i.e., gametic incompatibil-
ities). I have previously shown that gametic incompatibilities are rampant in the D. virilis sub-group, and that the
genetic basis is moderately complex but highly tractable using a combination of molecular genetics techniques
coupled with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of reproductive traits. The second project will tackle the
mechanisms of hybrid male sterility that are caused by incompatibilities between the Y and X chromosomes.
The Drosophila Y chromosome carries several male fertility factors, but it has seldom been directly implicated in
interspeciﬁc hybrid sterility between closely related species. Our preliminary data show that the Y chromosome
is necessary and sufﬁcient to cause sterility in hybrids.
 The research in this proposal will be innovative because we will deploy cutting edge tools in creative ways that
will allow us to dissect complex genetic mechanisms in a newly established model system."

In motor neuron diseases, neuromuscular junctions are lost and motor neurons degenerate resulting in
progressive paralysis and death. Post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) is hypothesized
to be disrupted in motor neuron diseases due to inherited mutations in proteins involved in miRNA processing,
such as TDP43, FUS, and SMN. Yet, the role of specific miRNAs in human motor neuron gene regulation and
function is not well characterized. I previously discovered that a single miRNA, miR-218, is uniquely enriched
and abundantly expressed in mouse motor neurons. Furthermore, mice lacking miR-218 exhibited deficits in
neuromuscular synaptogenesis and die due to muscle paralysis – phenotypes associated with motor neuron
disease. Subsequent studies have implicated miR-218 dysregulation as a mediator of motor neuron disease in
humans. However, the relationship between miR-218’s repression of target gene pathways and motor neuron
phenotypes has not been resolved, and the biological role of miR-218 has not been previously investigated in
humans, leaving an important translational gap in our knowledge of human motor neuron gene regulation and
function. In response to this challenge, we in the Pasca Lab have recently developed a three-dimensional, human
induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-derived model of human motor neuron development and function, called
cortico-motor assembloids, by fusing cortical, spinal, and skeletal muscle spheroids. Dr. Amin proposes using
this novel system to model the impact of miR-218 upon motor neuron development, target pathways, and human
specific-features of post-transcriptional gene regulation. This proposal will leverage Dr. Amin’s existing
proficiencies in motor neuron development, miRNA biology, and advanced transcriptomics and will enable new
career development training in stem cell biology and human brain organoid models with mentor Dr. Sergiu Pasca.
Dr. Amin will utilize the exceptional research environment and resources available at Stanford University. He will
be supported by his advisory committee comprising of Dr. Howard Chang, an expert in non-coding RNA mediated
gene regulation, Dr. Aaron Gitler, an expert in motor neuron biology and disease pathways, and Dr. Richard
Reimer, a practicing neurologist and expert in disease pathogenesis. Completion of this proposal will pave the
way for further investigations into the therapeutic modulation of miR-218 and its target mRNAs in human motor
neuron disease."

Social isolation, loneliness, and social environment continue to emerge as important factors in Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD), more so with the COVID-19 pandemic and observed trends in the
prevalence of social isolation, loneliness, and ADRD. Although there is increasing recognition these factors can
impact the aging brain, represent early expression of ADRD neuropathological changes, and influence health
behaviors and resource access, less is known about the biological mechanisms involved. Our overarching
hypothesis is that social isolation, loneliness, and social environment are distinct factors that alter brain biology
and influence trajectories of healthy neurocognitive aging and ADRD vulnerability. Because understanding
causal pathways and the cumulative role of these critical psychosocial factors through decades-long human
experimental trials is infeasible, here we propose a unique and innovative approach to comprehensively assess
these psychosocial determinants and temporally relate them to dynamic profiles of ADRD vulnerability,
leveraging one of the largest biologically well-characterized community-based cohorts in the US, the
Framingham Study (FS). Since 1948, FS has enrolled 3 generations of participants (ages 20-50) and 2 multi-
ethnic cohorts, examined them regularly for cognitive decline and dementia, and collected an exquisite array of
in-depth and cutting-edge “multi-omic”, imaging, and other data over their lifespan and before clinical ADRD
onset. The FS has a 70-year legacy of unique contributions to public health, and will continue make
breakthroughs in ADRD through its Brain Aging Program (3U19AG068753-02S1). We seek to leverage these
resources through the following specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain associations of social
isolation, loneliness, and social network structure with ADRD vulnerability over a lifetime. Our prior work
in FS suggests a molecular pathway related to neural plasticity/repair and cognitive resilience might be involved
in these mechanisms. We will collect a new wave of data on these factors—partially harmonized with the NIH
Toolbox and integrate this data with relevant psychosocial information at multiple previous exams. AIM 2 is to
identify and validate these biological pathways using causal inference analyses and machine-learning
methods on the extensive multi-omics data available. AIM 3 is to characterize social environment’s
cumulative role in psychosocial mechanisms of ADRD risk across the adult lifespan by developing a latent
social environment index with a validated geocode-based method and conducting sophisticated analyses. We
will validate our findings with other multi-ethnic cohort datasets and share all data through dbGaP and bioLINCC.
We expect to meaningfully evaluate whether and how these psychosocial factors influence the biology of healthy
neurocognitive aging and ADRD vulnerability and identify new pathways that may serve as targets for
intervention in the preclinical stage of ADRD. This will advance our understanding of the long-term effects of
psychosocial determinants, ADRD prevention, and how to address the root causes of disparities in ADRD."
10889688,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and a leading cause of death and chronic
illness in newborns, infants, and children. Prenatal screening and identification of CHD are critically important
for the management and treatment of CHD, but its availability and accuracy are confined by the limited
resolutions of current fetal imaging techniques. Personalized flow modeling has been widely used to augment
medical imaging modalities for adult and pediatric heart diseases. However, to date, no validated models have
been developed for fetal circulation.
 This project will focus on coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a common CHD accounting for 6-8% of live births
with CHD. CoA occurs when a portion of the aorta is narrowed, usually at the isthmus, and blood flow through it
is obstructed. Both false positive and false negative diagnoses frequently occur in contemporary prenatal
screening and identification of CoA. If the CoA is significant and is not diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion,
the newborn or young infant may develop cardiogenic shock or may die. There is an emerging need for a novel
technique that provides new metrics and knowledge of the fetal aorta. The proposed work aims to
(1) develop a novel, personalized flow modeling paradigm based on routinely used fetal echocardiography
that assesses high-fidelity hemodynamics of the fetal aorta.
 (2) validate this novel paradigm in comparison with cutting-edge fetal magnetic resonance imaging
techniques, including both phase-contrast and 4D flow sequences.
 (3) use this paradigm to conduct pilot studies identifying novel hemodynamic metrics that discriminate normal
aorta and CoA in fetuses. This project will focus on wall shear stress, which was linked to vessel dilation and
remodeling in general and recurrent coarctation in pediatric and adult patients with repaired CoA but has scarcely
been discussed in the fetal aorta with CoA.
 The proposed work will address the challenges and gaps in the research of fetal circulation and fetal heart
disease by producing a novel, validated cardiovascular flow modeling paradigm for personalized hemodynamics
in the fetal aorta. This project represents the first-of-its-kind endeavor to develop a rigorously validated
personalized flow model for fetal circulation. Our long-term goal is to develop paradigm-shifting computational
models for fetal circulation that can be used to uncover the pathogenesis of all critical CHDs to improve
diagnosis/prognosis and to aid in the personalized treatment/prevention of CoA and other critical CHDs.
 Additionally, this project will yield new data and knowledge on fetal aortic hemodynamics, which may enable
a better understanding of etiology and improved diagnosis and prognosis of CoA. The tools and knowledge
generated by this project will lay a solid foundation for future translational studies that could lead to improved
screening, diagnosis, and outcomes for children with CoA."

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by asthma, nasal polypo-
sis, and acute respiratory reactions to known cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors, including the commonly used non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as aspirin. Patients with AERD suffer a disproportional burden
of the nasal polyposis and asthma: most AERD patients need repeated sinus surgeries, they tend to have a
more severe asthma, and are more likely to develop upper and lower airway remodeling. There is no labora-
tory diagnostic test available for AERD, often delaying its diagnosis. Polyp growth is associated with a strong
type 2 pro-inflammatory state characterized by high systemic levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and leukotriene
E4 (LTE4), eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition in AERD causes a
multifold increase in PGD2 and LTE4, while it should instead decrease PGD2 and only minimally change LTE4
levels. This discrepancy suggests dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, likely due to as yet unidenti-
fied factors in AERD patients.
To uncover the role of nasal polyps in AERD pathophysiology, we have studied Staphylococcus (S.) aureus as
a frequent colonizer in the nasal polyp tissue of AERD patients. S. aureus exotoxins are known to activate leu-
kotriene biosynthesis in neutrophils, and the bacteria have also been shown to invade mast cells in nasal
polyps. In the proposed research, we will extend these observations by exploring the effects of S. aureus on
arachidonic acid metabolism, including changes in AERD and non-AERD polyp tissue in response to COX-1
inhibition. Because S. aureus is a pathogen that often evades immune defenses, it is plausible that S. aureus
can impact arachidonic acid metabolism to avoid the host’s antibacterial immune response.
The proposed research will test whether colonization or infection of nasal polyps by S. aureus contributes to
abnormal metabolism of arachidonic acid in AERD patients.
Aim 1: To determine if S. aureus exotoxins increase pro-inflammatory eicosanoid PGD2 and LTE4, levels in
AERD polyp tissue.
Aim 2: To determine the mast cell transcriptional program upregulated in AERD and identify if it is induced by
S. aureus.
The proposed research will potentially yield a new paradigm of AERD pathogenesis in which S. aureus acts as
a major environmental factor that dysregulates eicosanoid metabolism and contributes to AERD. In addition,
understanding this mechanism may lead to the development of novel diagnostic markers and of therapeutic
strategies to target S. aureus or mast cells to limit the extent of type-2 inflammation and improve health"
10889708,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Key early pregnancy events include fertilization, embryo development and transport, and embryo implantation.
A prerequisite for fertilization in a natural pregnancy is the timely migration of sperm through the uterus to the
oviduct/Fallopian tube. A prerequisite for embryo implantation is the transient readiness of the uterus, especially
the uterine luminal epithelium (LE), for embryo attachment to form the initial maternal-embryo interface. Sperm
are allogeneic and an embryo is semi-allogeneic to the biological mother-to-be and allogeneic to a surrogate
woman. How the uterine immune status is temporally regulated to provide a conducive environment for sperm
and embryo during early pregnancy remains a significant knowledge gap. Estrogen receptor α (ERα/Esr1) me-
diates E2 signaling in the uterus. ERα deficiency in the uterine epithelium of epiERα-/- (Esr1fl/-Wnt7aCre/+) mice
leads to defective semen liquefaction thus impaired sperm migration to the oviduct for fertilization, as well as a
disrupted uterine environment for embryos leading to failed early pregnancy. Our preliminary data demonstrated
massive infiltration of neutrophils in the un-liquified semen in the day 0.5 post-coitum (D0.5) epiERα-/- uterine
lumen and uterus. mRNA-seq of isolated LE cells from D0.5 and D3.5 Esr1fl/- (control) and epiERα-/- uteri revealed
upregulation of innate immune response pathways in the D0.5 epiERα-/- LE. Foremost among these is the IL-1β
signaling, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, consistent with increased neutrophil infiltration noted above. By
D3.5, ERα-dependent innate immune dysregulation diminishes. Collectively, these preliminary data implicate an
essential role of uterine epithelial ERα in temporally regulating the uterine immune environment during early
pregnancy. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which uterine epithelial ERα regulates preimplantation
uterine immune environment remain largely unexplored. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms
regulating uterine functions during early pregnancy thus helping alleviate uterine health and clinical issues re-
lated to infertility and early pregnancy loss. The specific goal of this application is to use the epiERα-/- mouse
model to elucidate mechanisms of uterine epithelial ERα in regulating the uterine immune environment for sperm
fitness (D0.5) and for transition (D0.5-D3.5) to a favorable immune environment for embryo implantation. Our
central hypothesis is that uterine epithelial ERα temporally regulates a conducive uterine immune environment
to support early pregnancy events. This will be tested in two aims using the epiERα-/- mouse model coupled with
molecular and immunological approaches. Aim 1. Determine the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which
uterine epithelial ERα temporally orchestrates immune status in the preimplantation uterus. Aim 2. Determine
the immunological mechanisms by which uterine epithelial ERα controls sperm fitness. Immunohistochemistry,
flow cytometry, and neutrophil depletion are among the employed approaches. The proposed work is significant
because understanding mechanisms regulating uterine immune environment is critical for developing diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches to detect and treat infertility and early pregnancy loss."
10889755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type II topoisomerases (Top2) alter chromatin topology by forming transient double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the
DNA, allowing a second DNA segment to pass through the DSB, and then rejoining the broken strands. Mutations
in the topoisomerase Top2B have been linked to neurodevelopmental delay and autism in humans. Studies in
mice have shown that Top2B regulates the transcription of developmentally regulated and neuronal activity-
dependent genes. A key mechanism by which Top2B regulates gene expression in neurons is by forming long-
lasting stimulus-dependent DSBs within the promoters of specific genes. However, how Top2B is regulated is
unknown. The proposed research attempts to bridge these knowledge gaps. Recently we published that in
response to neuronal stimulation, calcium influx through NMDA receptors activates the phosphatase calcineurin,
to dephosphorylate Top2B at residues S1509 and S1511 within its C-terminal domain (CTD), which induces
Top2B to form DSBs promoting the transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs). Exposing mice to a fear
learning paradigm also triggers DSB formation and Top2B dephosphorylation at S1509 and S1511 in the
hippocampus. Additional to these dephosphorylations, we observed other phosphorylation changes at the CTD
induced by neuronal activity that we have yet to study. Together, these observations provide the first insights
into the regulation of Top2B by its CTD. However, since the CTD is not part of the catalytic domains and is not
necessary for Top2B relaxation activity in vitro, it is unknown how the CTD regulates the activity of the catalytic
core in response to neuronal activity. It is critical to study how the CTD regulates Top2B because mutations at
the CTD cause late-onset sensorineural hearing loss in humans. The proposed research will use CRISPR on
the auditory neuroblast cell line US/VOT-N33 (N33) and/or the sensorineural HEI-OC1, to produce cell lines with
the mutations reported in patients (D1613H and K1435del) or without the serine residues that undergo dynamic
changes in phosphorylation in response to neuronal activity. The cells will be differentiated into sensory hair cells
or ganglion neurons and the effects of mutations on the formation of DSBs, and the regulation of IEG transcription
will be assessed. Then we will purify Top2B from the differentiated cells to study relaxation, cleavage, and
decatenation activity. We will also study the effect of the mutation on protein-protein interaction by coprecipitation
and mass spectrometry. The allosteric effects of the CTD on the catalytic core of Top2B will be examined using
cross-linking mass spectrometry. Finally, we will assess the distribution by subcellular fractionation and
immunocytochemistry, and genome-wide distribution by ChIP of active Top2B. Together, these efforts will
illuminate how Top2B is regulated by the CTD in response to stimulation and address how the mutations that
cause hearing loss impair this regulation, which is relevant to understand this disease."

With the career goal of becoming an independent physician-investigator, Dr. Benjamin Hayes describes a
mentored research project and a rigorous career development plan which will prepare him to study the testing
of interventions to improve the health of people who use drugs (PWUD). The prevalence of opioid use disorder
(OUD) in the US has resulted in a marked spike in overdose deaths. Buprenorphine (BUP) treatment for opioid
use disorder (OUD) reduces illicit opioid use and opioid overdose mortality, yet remains greatly underutilized.
The initiation of BUP remains a major barrier to treatment uptake. Two challenges that limit BUP use are: 1)
patients must typically avoid opioids for 24-48 hours before starting BUP, which results in a period of planned
withdrawal symptoms; and 2) patients may experience preciptitated withdrawal during BUP initiation if taken
too soon. Research has suggested that both types of withdrawal deter people from starting BUP and are
reasons for initiation drop-out. Our goal is to rigorously develop and pilot test a “microdosing” protocol
that overcomes the phamacologic challenges of buprenorphine treatment initiation. Microdosing is the
process of starting buprenorphine at doses low enough to not precipitate withdrawal and incrementally
increasing to therapeutic doses, at which point the patient stops their use full agonist opioids. We hypothesize
that microdosing will increase buprenorphine treatment initiation success by (1) avoiding the need to
experience withdrawal, and (2) reducing the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Case studies suggest that
microdosing is feasible and may minimize withdrawal, but no randomized control trials of buprenorphine
microdosing inititian have established safety and effectiveness. In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, we
propose to pilot test an innovative buprenorphine microdosing protocol vs. treatment as usual (TAU),
defined as standard home initiation of buprenorphine treatment. We will randomize 70 people with OUD
to microdosing or TAU, conduct study visits at baseline and weeks 1 and 4, and provide participants with
mobile phones to collect rich electronic Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data. This proposal aims to
1) determine preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and safety and 2) stakeholder experiences to plan for a fully
powered, multi-site RCT; and 3) use the EMA data to investigate whether symptoms of withdrawal, anxiety,
and cravings mediate initiation success. These will inform the design of a fully powered RCT to test the efficacy
of BUP microdosing initiation and enrich the literature of barriers to BUP initiation. To accomplish these aims,
Dr. Hayes will pursue training in randomized controlled trial design and conduct, qualitative methods and
analysis, EMA design, conduct, and analysis, and scientific writing. With completion of these activities, along
with intensive mentorship, Dr. Hayes will develop the skills necessary to achieve his career goal of becoming
an independent investigator."

Fahed will perform the proposed work at MGH and the Broad under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Ellinor, a
physician-scientist and international leader in cardiovascular genetics with an outstanding track record for
mentorship and Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, a physician-scientist with expertise in coronary artery disease genetics

despite improved treatment of risk factors. Genomic risk provides opportunity for earlier recognition and
targeted intervention prior to onset of risk factors, but there are two key barriers for its use: 1) There is no
single model that combines genomic and nongenomic factors to predict absolute risk of CAD, and 2) existing
genomic risk prediction underperforms in non-European ancestries. To address these knowledge gaps, the PI
will first develop and validate a genomic risk model for CAD that combines monogenic, polygenic, and somatic
variation using data on >460,000 European ancestry individuals. Second, he will develop and validate an
integrated risk model for CAD that combines genomic and nongenomic (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood
sugar, exercise, weight, diet, and smoking) risk drivers in European ancestry individuals. Third, he will optimize
this model for individuals of African, South Asian, East Asian and Hispanic ancestries using data on >150,000
individuals from several multiethnic studies. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the
scientific foundation for disclosing integrated risk information for CAD to individuals and their caregivers to
facilitate targeted interventions. Furthermore, the proposal will provide key training of the PI to facilitate his
transition to an independent physician investigator in cardiovascular genetics and the data generated will serve
as the basis for a future R01 application."

10886770,"Project Summary
In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cannabis use is an important topic and is the
most commonly used drug among HIV-infected individuals. Positive and negative effects of cannabis use in the
context of HIV have been reported for various biological processes, including cognitive performance and immune
function. Reports vary from cannabis enhancing cognitive function to causing synergistic decline in cognition.
Thus, the exact role and limits of chronic cannabis use on HIV cognition under immune perturbations remain
unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of cannabis-associated oral microbiome on
neurocognitive performance in HIV disease by focusing on clinical (Aim 1) and preclinical (Aim 2) neuroHIV
models. We and other colleagues have found that Actinomyces species bacteria (e.g. A. meyeri and A.
odontolyticus) in the oral cavity of humans, are enriched in the saliva from chronic cannabis users compared to
non-users and A. meyeri is enriched in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected individuals. But oral A.
species enrichment was not demonstrable in tabacco smokers or chronic cocaine users. Further, oral enrichment
of A. meyeri was associated with younger age of first cannabis use. Here, we aim to investigate if A. species
bacteria has a significant role in HIV neuropathogenesis. To achieve this goal, in Specific Aim 1, HIV cannabis
users will be assessed to determine the link between cannabis use-associated oral microbiome (i.e., enrichment
of A. meyeri) and cognitive performance by focusing on 1) saliva bacteriome and mycobiome and plasma
translocation of A. species bacterial antigens; 2) molecular mechanisms of A. species bacteria mediated TLR2
signaling pathway activation in myeloid cells; 3) neurocognitive performance and its association with microbiome.
Specific Aim 2 will make use of two well-established transgenic (tg) mouse models of neuroHIV, including the
HIV Tg26 tg and the HIV Tat tg mice, to allow us to determine: 1) the chronic effects of THC and CBD exposure
on neurocognition and neuropathology; 2) the chronic effects of THC and CBD exposure on enrichment of A.
species bacteria and myeloid cell infiltration to the brain under antiretroviral (ART) drugs; and 3) the mechanisms
of cannabis-associated A. meyeri bacteria on neurocognition, neuropathology, and endocannabinoid levels.
Understanding the role of chronic cannabis use on oral microbiome and it’s effects on neurocognitive
performance in HIV disease is critical to determine its therapeutic benefits and limits in the treatment of patients
with accelerated central nervous system pathogenesis under traditional combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART)."
10886777,"Urinary bladder tumors arise from the transitional epithelium and rarely penetrate the bladder’s detrusor muscle.
Thus, complete tumor resection is frequently possible using a transurethral instrument to remove the tumor at
its root without total bladder removal. Unfortunately, genomic instability is rampant throughout the transitional
epithelium in most patients and tumor relapse is common despite complete tumor removal. As a result, patients
require lifelong endoscopic monitoring, multiple biopsies, and repeated intravesical therapies. mTOR inhibition
treats and prevents bladder cancer (BC) in preclinical models and is thought to work by directly targeting bladder
tumors. While this dogma is true, it provides an incomplete picture of the potential activity of this therapy in BC.
Our preliminary data shows favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of low dose rapamycin in
bladder tissues. We also show that a novel encapsulated formulation of rapamycin (eRapa) modulates immune
responses and these effects favor improved anti-BC immunity and improved responses towards BCG, which is
standard-of-care immune therapy for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BC). We propose
investigating eRapa for secondary cancer prevention in patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer. Aim 1 conducts a phase II double-blind randomized controlled trial of long-term (one year)
prevention with eRapa versus placebo. Outcome measures include efficacy, tolerability, and effects on cognition
and physical function. Efficacy is assessed through standard-of-care surveillance monitoring to capture relapses
and to estimate recurrence-free survival. Tolerability is measured with validated BC-specific symptom
assessments and global quality of life questionnaires. Cognition and physical function are assessed with
validated executive/memory function testing and by physical performance testing. Aim 2 test the hypothesis that
eRapa improves immune function in patients with BC by examining the effects of eRapa on circulating immune
cells, including memory T cell differentiation, and tumor-specific immunity. For patients concurrently receiving
intravesical BCG, the ability of eRapa to boost BCG-specific immunity is tested. If successful, this project will
facilitate a phase III registration trial for a new secondary prevention agent for BC patients. In addition, this work
provides foundational insights into immune events in elderly BC patients that are useful to developing other
cancer immunotherapies."
10886782,"Abstract
 Huntington’s disease is caused by polyglutamine expansions in the huntingtin protein. These polyQ
expansions make the huntingtin protein, and its naturally occurring exon1 fragment (Httex1), more aggregation
prone. Deposition of fibrillar Httex1 aggregates in the brain is a hallmark of the disease in patients and animal
models. We have shown that Httex1 aggregation is a step-wise process wherein Httex1 gives rise to different
misfolded species prior to formation of fibrils. Early species in the misfolding pathway are of particular interest
as they can cause the formation of seeds, which cause further misfolding of monomeric Httex1. This process not
only enhances toxicity in a given cell, but it can also cause spreading of misfolding throughout the brain. In
addition, earlier misfolding intermediates could also directly contribute to disease, as their toxicity has been
observed in cell culture experiments. Despite their importance, early misfolding intermediates cannot easily be
detected in biological tissues and it has not been possible to interfere with their seeding ability or toxicity. In this
project, we aim to address these fundamental problems by developing genetically encoded ligands (peptides)
that bind early misfolding intermediates and by testing their potential biomarker or therapeutic utility.
To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a team of three PIs with expertise in peptide ligand discovery
(Roberts), huntingtin protein structure and function (Langen), and cell-based and animal-based disease models
(Chen). The Langen lab has laid the biochemical foundation for the proposal by identifying and characterizing
different forms of Httex1 aggregates. Working together, the Roberts lab has used directed evolution and mRNA
display to generate Httex1 directed (HD) peptide ligands against protofibrils. The Langen and Chen lab have
demonstrated that HD peptides inhibit Httex1 misfolding in vitro and in cultured cells. Importantly, HD peptides
also protect from Httex1 toxicity in cultured cells. In Aim 1, we propose to extend this work by characterizing the
interactions of HD peptides with protofibrils using biophysical methods. Specifically, we will determine the HD
peptide’s affinity, specificity, molecular mechanism of interaction with protofibrils and we will evaluate their ability
to inhibit misfolding. Moreover, we will use peptide multimerization and other optimizations to achieve ultra-high
affinity binding. Aim 2 then uses these well characterized binders in animal and cell models to evaluate their
utility as biomarkers and therapeutics in cell cultures and animal models. In aim 3, we will generate binders for
the earliest misfolding intermediate, the a-helical oligomers, and test our prediction that binders to these species
block the formation of seeds and protect from Httex1 misfolding and toxicity."
10886783,"Serotonin is a key regulator of bone metabolism in animals. Murine models show that central (brain) serotonin
positively regulates bone mass by inhibiting the deleterious effects of the sympathetic nervous system on
osteoblasts. In mice, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have time-dependent effects. Acutely,
SSRIs directly inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, but with chronic use the central effect of SSRIs predominate
causing bone loss by increasing sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone, which counteracts the early effects
on resorption and reduces bone formation. In contrast, the role of endogenous serotonin in regulating human
skeletal health is not well delineated. Recent work, however, indicates that (SSRIs) increase the risk of fracture
by two times, but the mechanisms by which SSRIs do so in humans have not been clearly defined. Most
human studies have focused on assessing areal bone mineral density and have not considered the important
time-dependent effects of SSRIs, which has led to conflicting data. The effects of SSRIs on muscle function,
which may also contribute to fracture risk, have only started to be explored. We have begun to make progress
in this area using a multimodal approach with dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral
quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), body composition and measurement of physical function. Our
data indicate this is a useful approach. Our recent work shows antidepressant use is associated with reduced
physical performance as well as cortical deterioration, the latter of which can be detected with DXA and HR-
pQCT. Supporting a role for serotonin in particular, participants taking antidepressants with moderate or high
affinity for the serotonin transporter (such as SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) had
cortical deficits that were not present in those using other categories of antidepressants. Utilizing, DXA
HRpQCT, transiliac bone biopsy as well as novel assays assessing osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and
gene expression, the goal of this proposal is to determine if the tissue, cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which SSRIs act on the musculoskeletal system in humans is analogous to those demonstrated in murine
models. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic use of SSRIs and antidepressants with
high/moderate serotonin transporter affinity decrease bone formation by increasing sympathetic tone, which
leads to bone loss and fracture. Effects on muscle mass and function will also be investigated. This work will
help elucidate the role of serotonin as a regulator of human musculoskeletal health and guide the development
of musculoskeletal screening and treatment strategies in those taking SSRIs and other antidepressants.
Because long-term SSRI use is common, detrimental effects on skeletal health are important to elucidate and
mitigate. Moreover, doing so may provide insight into targetable human musculoskeletal regulators."
11059597,"Background: Numerous challenges are faced by individuals in the general community who identify as lesbian,
gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) when seeking healthcare. The LGTB community reports harassment,
disrespect, discrimination and delay in care as well as reduced likelihood to receive needed screening tests.
Many LGBT Veterans are resistant to seeking VA healthcare at all based on past discrimination (perceived and
real) and an unwelcoming system. For LGTB Veterans with spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D), there are
likely additional considerations related to sexuality, bowel and bladder care, body image and mental health.
Health care providers often lack experience in dealing with the physical and mental health and sociocultural
issues related to LGBT identity, especially in the context of delivering SCI specialty care. Therefore, there is a
great need for information on the experiences and unmet needs of this population in order to design VA clinical
programs to correctly and sensitively address their complex health care needs and promote their wellbeing.
Significance/Impact: This pilot project addresses HSR&D priority areas of Access to Care, Health Equity, and
Disability/SCI. Our overarching goal is to open the door to improving VA health care for this vulnerable and
understudied population. Based on limited clinical experience, awareness of the problems commonly faced by
individuals with SCI/D, and extrapolation from published findings from the non-disabled LGBT population, we
expect to find significant disparity in access to knowledgeable clinicians who are sensitive to the specific needs
of LGBT Veterans who live with SCI/D. Our study will provide essential information from both Veteran and
provider perspectives to begin to fill this gap and contribute invaluable data towards developing solutions.
Innovation: This project is innovative as there is a dearth of information regarding health care needs of LGBT
Veterans with SCI/D. The investigative team includes experts in LGBT health care within and outside VA; VA
SCI clinicians; and VA researchers with expertise in SCI/D clinical care and programs, qualitative methodology,
and VA program implementation. Evidence of SCI/D and Veteran-specific experiences and barriers as well as
VA provider knowledge and attitudes will be novel information not available in the literature.
Specific Aims: 1) Elicit the perspectives of LGBT Veterans with SCI/D about their experiences with VA care,
and 2) Elicit the experiences of SCI/D providers and their approaches to caring for LGBT Veterans with SCI/D.
Methodology: We will apply qualitative methodology to elicit (i) personal perspectives and lived experiences of
25 Veterans and (ii) attitudes and knowledge/awareness of 15 health care professionals whose focus is SCI/D
care. We will sample from the 25 VA SCI/D Centers to include different regions of the country, sampling urban
and rural settings. We will aim for inclusion across the LGBT spectrum and will over-recruit female participants
to include the potentially unique perspectives of women with SCI/D. We will aim to recruit a range of ages as
well as SCI chronicity ranging from recently injured to SCI of long duration. We will include all ethnic/racial
groups in order to explore potential cultural issues. The VA SCI/D provider cohort will include physicians and
surgeons, nurse practitioners, nurses, therapists, psychologists, social workers, and any relevant disciplines.
We will conduct semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions and prompts and then perform matrix
analysis drawing from existing SCI/D and LGBT literature to identify barriers, attitudes, and experiences of
patient and clinician cohorts. We will probe for positive experiences in addition to barriers and unmet needs.
We will primarily use the Health Equity Promotion model as the basis for our domains of enquiry overlaid with
the theoretical framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability.
Implementation / Next Steps: Future research may involve validation of our findings via a more comprehensive
qualitative study, a population-based survey, analysis of relevant health services utilization, and development
of training programs to better meet the needs of this population through implementation of targeted care."
10900656,"This K99/R00 application from Kaice A LaFavers, PhD, is designed to acquire the knowledge and
training necessary to transition to an independent faculty position leading a research program
focused on kidney-organ cross talk in the setting of sepsis and severe infection. Sepsis is a
dysregulated host response to infection and is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality
worldwide. When acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in the setting of sepsis, mortality doubles to
approximately 1 in 2 patients. We have recent evidence that the kidney-derived Tamm Horsfall
Protein (THP) is protective against sepsis mortality. THP is secreted from the kidney primarily into the
urine, where it is the most abundant protein component. However, a small portion of THP produced in
the kidney is secreted into the kidney interstitium, where it enters the circulation. Increased levels of
serum THP have recently been associated with decreased mortality and protection against chronic
kidney disease in human cohorts. Circulating THP has also emerged as an immune regulator, with
genetic depletion of THP leading to decreased number and function of mononuclear phagocytes in
the kidney. In both human and animal models of AKI, THP is acutely depleted shortly following injury.
In the current proposal, the overall hypothesis is that the kidney protects other organs during sepsis
by releasing THP in the circulation, where it enhances macrophage function and signaling. This
hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims. One aim will establish that circulating THP released by
the kidney is a key protective molecule in sepsis using a genetic knockout model of THP depletion in
murine sepsis. This aim will also determine the potential of treating septic mice with exogenous THP
to improve sepsis outcomes. The second aim will define the effect of THP on enhancing macrophage
function by assessing in vivo phagocytosis, macrophage activation and signaling, and macrophage-
derived IL-15-dependent signaling in sepsis. Under the mentorship of Dr. Tarek Ashkar, Dr. LaFavers
extends her current research on THP biology and proposes additional training. This additional training
will be in the areas of technical skill development, including bioinformatics, advanced imaging
analytics, protein purification, mouse model development and breeding, along with professional
career development in science communication, lab management, grant/manuscript writing and
mentoring. The completion of this proposal will provide Dr. LaFavers with the expertise and training
for her first R01 submission and the establishment of an independent career."
10887832,"Project Summary. The prevalence of daily cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) has increased in
the United States over the past two decades. Unfortunately, psychosocial treatments produce minimal long-
term abstinence rates and no FDA-approved medications for CUD exist. Thus, identifying novel CUD treatment
targets is an increasingly urgent public health need. Stress-elicited cannabis use motivation has been
implicated in worse CUD outcomes, but a mechanistic understanding of how acute stress increases cannabis
use motivation in CUD is limited. The PI’s work has demonstrated that acute psychosocial stress enhancement
of subsequent cannabis cue incentive salience, as indexed by the late positive potential (neural measure of
approach-motivated attention recorded using electroencephalography [EEG]), was associated with worse CUD
severity and intervention response, independent of subjective craving. Moreover, hypothalamic pituitary
adrenal [HPA]-axis, rather than noradrenergic or subjective reactivity to the psychosocial stressor was
associated with subsequent potentiation of the cannabis cue-elicited late positive potential. These studies
suggest that non-genomic, rapid glucocorticoid effects may be a contributing mechanism in stress amplification
of neural drug-cue reactivity, but their correlational designs preclude causal inference. Further, psychosocial
stressors are unable to isolate HPA-axis vs. noradrenergic components of stress reactivity. To isolate HPA-
axis activation and test causality, pharmacological manipulations, common in animal models but rare in human
studies, will be used to produce separate and co-operative glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone) and noradrenergic
(yohimbine) activation. We will employ a 2x2 randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design in
36 cannabis users with severe CUD. Our primary aim is to test the causal potentiating effect of glucocorticoids
on neural drug-cue reactivity, and further determine if the effect depends on co-occurring noradrenergic
stimulation. Preclinical work indicates that glucocorticoids can potentiate reward motivation via mobilization of
endocannabinoid activity (primary target of cannabis). Thus, as an exploratory aim in line with NIDA priorities
(NOT-DA-22-048), we will obtain plasma samples to test the impact of pharmacological stress on circulating
endocannabinoids and their mediating role in glucocorticoid potentiation of neural drug-cue reactivity. This
project represents a highly novel integration of a rigorous pharmacological challenge design with biological
markers of drug-cue incentive salience and endocannabinoid system activity. If hypotheses are confirmed, one
causal mechanism through which stress increases neural cannabis cue reactivity will be known, which has
immediate implications for testing experimental therapeutics. The long-term goal is to understand how a stress-
related mechanism predictive of worse CUD phenotype is generated and can be blocked in CUD.
Development of this model will provide a valid, efficient and (relative to other neuroimaging methods) low-cost
approach to screen candidate medications and optimize psychosocial drug cue exposure therapies."
10890620,"Project Summary
 Cell death has a critical role in human development and recovery following injury or disease. This is
because dying cells produce signals that can significantly impact the behavior of the surrounding cells. The
identity and consequences of these signals are diverse and context dependent, but many are known to
regulate the survival, activity and proliferation of neighboring cells following injury. Thus, a better understanding
of how dying cells impact surviving tissue could uncover novel therapeutic interventions to improve healing and
regeneration following injury or disease.
 While this signaling phenomenon has been characterized in apoptotic cell death, it is unclear whether
unregulated forms of cell death, such as necrosis, have a similar impact on tissue behavior and repair.
Necrosis is the rapid, disordered death of cells, which can occur in any tissue and is central to many human
conditions, including traumatic injuries (burns, frostbite), infections, and ischemic injuries like strokes and heart
attacks. Several factors released from necrotic cells have been identified, however, the identity of other signals
and whether they influence recovery has yet to be examined. The aim of this proposal is to investigate how
necrotic wounds impact surrounding tissues to influence recovery and regeneration.
 Evidence that signals from dying cells impact nearby tissues first originated from studies of the larval
wing primordia in Drosophila, called imaginal discs. These tissues have significant regenerative capacity, the
study of which has led to important insights into the genetic events necessary for damage-induced tissue
recovery. However, most of these studies examine apoptosis-induced regeneration, limiting our understanding
of how cell death impacts surviving tissue to this type of injuries. To overcome this limitation, we have
established a genetic tool that allows us to trigger either necrosis or apoptosis in the developing wing disc, and
to genetically manipulate the surrounding cells that respond to each type of damage.
 With this tool we found that discs successfully regenerate in each case, but via different mechanisms.
Notably, necrosis leads to widespread apoptotic cell death at a distance from the wound. This necrosis-
induced apoptosis, or NiA, is necessary to drive regenerative proliferation and is therefore critical for proper
recovery. The cause of NiA and how it promotes regeneration are currently unknown. Here, we propose to
characterize the genetic response that leads to successful regeneration following necrosis focusing on the role
of NiA. Our work aims to identifying how necrosis leads to NiA, understand how NiA promotes regeneration,
and comprehensively characterize the necrosis-induced regeneration program that results in NiA using whole
genome sequencing approaches. Together, the results of these experiments will contribute to our fundamental
understanding of tissue repair in response to necrosis, which is ultimately essential for developing novel
therapeutic approaches to treat necrotic wounds and promote regeneration in humans."
10890625,"The long-term objective is to use animal models to find mechanisms and approaches whereby adoptively
transferred T cells transduced with mutant neoantigen-specific TCRs can eradicate solid cancers in patients
without destroying normal tissues. Tumors in patients have been present at least for months or years and are
usually at least 1cm in diameter at time of diagnosis. Therefore, large and long-established solid tumors
expressing autochthonous (untransfected) mutant neoantigens are the focus of this proposal. A key element
being explored is the destruction of the immunosuppressive stromal tumor microenvironment by transfer of
MHC Class II restricted neoantigen-specific TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells (CD4+TCR). These T cells cause
tumor destruction followed by long-term arrest of tumor growth. A second key element being explored is that
CD4+TCR T cells form 4-cell-type clusters with MHC Class I restricted neoantigen-specific TCR-transduced
CD8+ T cells (CD8+TCR) which are attracted to the cluster by recognizing the cross-presented neoantigen on
stromal CD11b+ tumor-associated macrophages. Finally, intraclonal non-heritable heterogeneity is explored as
novel mechanism of escape of cancers despite cancer cells seemingly lacking mutant neoantigen-negative
variants. Aim 1 is to determine the requirements and mechanisms for CD4+TCR T cells to destroy, without
CD8+ T cells, advanced solid tumors and subsequently arrest their growth. It will be tested whether targeting
tumor stroma is essential for this CD4+TCR-mediated destruction/arrest and whether these effects are
independent of direct cancer cell recognition. Furthermore, it will be examined whether therapeutic CD4+TCRs
can be isolated from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that are failing to reject the cancer. Finally, it will be
tested whether appropriate lysosomal processing of mutant neoantigen is a decisive predictor for CD4+TCR-
mediated tumor destruction. Aim 2 is to determine whether 4-cell-type clusters at the effector phase are
essential for cancer eradication by CD4+TCRs and CD8+TCRs. It will be analyzed whether direct cancer cell
recognition by the CD8+TCR is required for cancer eradication. Furthermore, it will be tested whether, for
synergistic cancer cell destruction, the two neoantigens must be released from the same cancer cell because
this would allow the CD8+TCR T cells to recognize the cross-presented neoantigen on the same CD11b+
stromal cell also being recognized by the CD4+TCR T cells. Antigen-specific 4-cell-type cluster formation will
be quantified and modeled in vitro using longitudinal time-lapse imaging. Finally, will be determined whether
cancers brought into equilibrium by CD4+TCRs can still be eradicated by subsequent treatment with CD8+TCR
transduced T cells. Aim 3 is to determine mechanisms of escape and the molecular nature of CD8+TCR
recognized antigens that can be used to eradicate cancers in synergy with CD4+TCRs. It will be examined
whether cloned cancer cells seemingly lacking antigen-negative variants nevertheless escape by the presence
of cancer cells with low mutant mRNA expression due to intraclonal heterogeneity."
10890626,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award for Dr. Matthew Kutcher, a trauma
surgeon and surgical intensivist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Dr. Kutcher is establishing
himself as an early career investigator in translational trauma research, with a specific interest in the role of
circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a driver of trauma-induced coagulopathy. This proposed K08 award
will accomplish the following goals: (1) provide specific training and mentorship in mitochondrial, platelet, and
fibrinolytic biology; (2) apply these newly-acquired skills and expertise to a translational study of mtDNA as a
driver of trauma-induced coagulopathy, including clinical, mechanistic, and animal model arms; and (3) use these
scientifically and clinically meaningful studies to facilitate independent funding supporting a career as a mature
clinician-scientist. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Kutcher will be mentored by a Scientific Advisory Committee
comprised of content experts and tested mentors. The Committee will be led by Dr. Robert Hester, a key
institutional mentor of Dr. Kutcher’s, and includes leaders in the fields of mitochondrial physiology (Dr. Mark
Gillespie and Dr. Jonathan Hosler) and coagulation biology (Dr. Mitchell Cohen and Dr. Alan Jones). The
Committee is designed to collectively span the translational spectrum from clinical observational studies (Drs.
Cohen and Jones), to mechanistic studies (Drs. Gillespie and Hosler), to preclinical animal models (Dr. Hester)
with a strong foundation of statistical support (Dr. William Hillegass). Strong professional development and
mentorship for a lifelong career as a clinician-scientist will be provided by Drs. Cohen and Jones. This study is
motivated by the prevalence and deleterious effects of platelet dysfunction as a key component of coagulation
abnormalities after injury, for which mechanistic understanding is poor and pharmacologic therapies are lacking.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that injury-induced release of mtDNA leads to mtDNA-mediated platelet
activation, resulting in functionally impaired circulating platelets and inhibition of systemic fibrinolysis. Although
precedent exists for the importance of mtDNA as a key effector of coagulopathy in clinical observational studies
of trauma and in mechanistic and animal models of other disease states, mtDNA-mediated effects on platelets
have not been studied in trauma. Using a truly translational approach, this proposal will examine a core set of
key platelet and fibrinolytic functional assays, as applied to a prospective human study arm to gain key clinical
insights (AIM 1), an ex vivo study arm in which to probe mechanisms (AIM 2), and an animal study in which to
replicate human findings and evaluate potential interventions (AIM 3). These studies will address a critical
knowledge gap in our understanding of trauma-induced coagulopathy, and identify specific mechanisms and
novel therapeutic targets that will form the basis for a compelling R01 proposal focused on translating these
findings into mitochondrial-targeted therapies to improve our resuscitation of critically injured patients."
10888508,"Abstract. Obesity is a predictor of multiple negative health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, coronary
heart disease, hypertension, various cancers, and premature death. Today, nearly two-thirds of US adults are
overweight or obese, and one out of three is obese or morbidly obese. Obesity disproportionally affects African
Americans, who have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of obesity (49.9%). Obesity disparities by race and
geolocation result from complicated interactions between individual behaviors (e.g., physical activities, healthy
food choices) and socioeconomic and environmental context (income, public infrastructure, neighborhood
green lands). Individuals’ obesity-related behaviors are embedded in their communities and shaped by
structural factors (e.g., racial segregation) and built environments (infrastructure and resources). The
obesogenic environment produces conditions that encourage the overconsumption of calories and sedentary
behaviors. For instance, distribution of different food resources (e.g., healthy food grocery stores, fast-food
restaurants) within a residence area may influence people’s food choice and consumption. Likewise,
neighborhoods with few walking or bike trails, poor street lighting, limited public transportation, and a lack of
recreational spaces such as parks hinder physical activity and thus increase obesity risk. Traditional obesogenic
environment indices are limited by a lack of timely monitoring the dynamic utilization of the infrastructures,
challenges in integrating with behavioral data, and the potential bias due to self-report survey. To address
these limitations and better assess and explore racial disparities of obesity, we propose to develop and test a
novel measurement tool to assess obesity-related behaviors at multiple geographic levels (i.e., census
blockgroup, tract, and county) in the US. First, a novel visitation-based obesogenic environment measurement
(VOEM) will be developed using cellphone-based place visitation data to measure three types of obesity-related
behaviors: physical activity (visitation to the exercise facilities such as parks and gyms), healthy food choices
(visitation to healthy food outlets such as supermarkets and organic groceries), and less healthy food choices
(visitation to fast-food restaurants and convenience stores). Second, the validity and performance of the
VOEM will be assessed in terms of predicting adult obesity rates and explaining associated racial disparities at
multiple geographic levels in the US by controlling for population-level social determinants of health and other
sociodemographic factors based on public available datasets. This comprehensive, valid, and near real-time
measurement instrument can be used as a surveillance tool to monitor population-level patterns and changes
of proxy obesity-related behaviors over space and time (e.g., seasonal trends), map obesogenic environments at
various geographic levels, and thus inform tailored and evidence-based policy decision making and public
health strategies for reducing racial disparities of obesity in terms of resource allocation, development of
prevention efforts, and efficacy evaluation of relevant health behavior interventions."

The overarching goal of this CHAVD is to develop a sequential HIV vaccine regimen that
induces sustained protective levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans. bnAbs
provide complete protection against HIV infection in preclinical models. We hypothesize that an
effective HIV vaccine will need to consistently induce bnAbs against 2-3 different sites on the
HIV Envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the virus in most (>90%) of vaccine recipients. Targeting
multiple sites is necessary to provide adequate coverage against the huge diversity of global
isolates. We propose a sequential strategy in which a series of designed immunogens guide
antibody responses from precursors to bnAbs. We are intensely developing and testing
immunogens. We have shown proof-of-principle of the sequential strategy in preclinical models
and our first three immunogens are entering manufacturing or clinical trials shortly.
The second major goal of this CHAVD is to generate immunogens that induce protective non-
neutralizing antibody (nnAb) responses that can either act alone or augment the protective
activity of bnAb responses. To accomplish this goal, we propose a tiered approach in which the
ability of nnAbs to capture infectious virions and to clear infected cells in vivo in two established
mouse models will be explored. The most effective nnAbs, alone and in combination with other
nnAbs and bnAbs, will then be assessed for their ability to protect nonhuman primates against
virus challenge. Protective nnAbs will be used as templates for immunogen design.
To support our translational effort, we have organized state-of the-art Manufacturing, Clinical
Trials Sample Analysis and Management and Operations units. In addition, we have established
twelve Scientific Research Support Units, headed by leaders in their fields, to underpin the
diverse scientific and technical capabilities required to execute our comprehensive and highly
integrated vaccine program
Finally, this CHAVD proposal is built upon a highly successful, innovative and efficient CHAVI-
ID program that has made major scientific contributions to the HIV vaccine field. The CHAVD
provides the opportunity to advance and translate these contributions into an HIV vaccine."

Kanwal M. Farooqi, MD is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at Columbia
University Irving Medical Center. Her long term goal is to create a shift in what is considered standard of care in
advanced imaging for patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Specifically, she aims to
demonstrate the utility and need for inclusion of personalized 3D printed models for pre-procedural planning in
patients with complex cardiac abnormalities. To that end, she will be focusing on patients with CHD and heart
failure (HF). Ventricular assist devices (VAD) in patients with CHD and HF remain underutilized, in part due to
the highly variable cardiac anatomy and complex physiology. This disparity exists despite outcomes following
VAD placement having been shown to be similar in patients with and without CHD. Imaging technologies such
as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are limiting in that they demonstrate
cardiac anatomy in 2D planes. 3D printed models allow the surgeon to visualize the cardiac anatomy in 3D as
they will see it in the operating room.
This is a prospective multicenter randomized control trial assessing the utility of preoperative use of 3D printed
personalized models use for VAD and cannula placement planning. The aims of this study are: 1) To assess if
3D printed cardiac models improve visualization of VAD and cannula placement sites in CHD-HF patients as
compared to 2D imaging. 2) To determine if perioperative factors and patient outcomes improve in CHD-HF
patients with use of 3D printed model in VAD placement planning. These aims will be accomplished through
implementation of surgical survey tools and collection of clinical data to assess improvement in outcomes.
Surgeons will report on survey tools, the ease with which important surgical landmarks such as cannula sites
are visualized on routine modes of imaging as compared to a 3D printed model. Clinical data will be compared
between the model and control group to assess improvement in clinical variables such as cardiopulmonary
bypass time and VAD flows. CUIMC is the primary site for this study with Dr. Farooqi as the primary investigator.
Dr. Farooqi’s career development plan consists of the following learning modules and training goals: 1) Training
in patient oriented research methods and multicenter study conduction 2) Surgical survey design and
implementation 3) Image acquisition and model creation methods 4) Research dissemination and career
Development. The co-mentoring and advisory team which she has organized will help her to acquire these skills
and successfully complete her learning goals through this award. Through completion of this study, Dr. Farooqi
aims to demonstrate the significance of 3D printed in pre-procedural planning for patients with complex CHD.
This will lead to an independent NIH proposal aiming to demonstrate the importance of incorporation of these
models across a wider range of congenital heart lesions and procedures, changing the way we think of standard
of care for advanced image modality inclusion in the care of patients with complex CHD."
10892642,"Project Summary/Abstract
 During development of the cerebral cortex, cortical projection neuron subtypes extend axons to innervate
distinct targets located at great distances (103-105 cell body diameters) from their nucleus-containing somata.
This precise navigation and circuit development is regulated by growth cones (GCs): subcellular compartments
at tips of growing axons that rapidly integrate extracellular signals to control development of neural circuits, then
mature into synapses. Since GCs respond rapidly to chemical cues, while hours/days are required to transport
molecules between GCs and their parent somata, GCs highly likely function semi-autonomously. Prior work has
also revealed that local protein synthesis and degradation pathways in GCs are required for responses to some
directional cues. However, function of most GC proteins in axon guidance and circuit development have not been
identified, and even less is known about subtype-specific roles of GC proteins. This proposal combines recently
developed subtype-specific GC purification with ultra-low-input proteomics to 1) investigate subtype-specific GC
proteomes at distinct developmental stages (pre- and post-midline crossing) to identify and functionally
investigate proteins with stage-specific roles, and 2) investigate subtype-specific proteomes of dysfunctional GCs
to identify and functionally investigate dysregulated proteins with critical roles in precise circuit wiring.
 These rigorous in vivo investigations will deepen understanding of subtype-, and stage-specific mechanisms
regulating subcellular proteostasis in GCs, and how these processes control axon pathfinding and formation of
synaptic circuitry in cortical projection neuron subtypes. The intersection of circuit formation and subcellular
proteostasis has substantial"
10892357,"Project Summary The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop first-in-class, best-in-class
noncoding RNA-based gene therapeutics with a novel mechanism of action, to improve standard of care
(SOC) for a broad range of blood and vascular diseases with unmet clinical need: management of thrombotic
risk, and management of bleeding disorders. The basis for these therapeutics is our discovery of efficient,
tissue-specific, tunable, temporally-controlled, non-integrative gene suppression in platelets and
megakaryocytes (MKs) in vivo, via tissue-selective transfection with ectopic naked double-stranded (ds) short
inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) harboring modified nucleotides, following intravenous or subdermal administration in
mice. We have shown for the first time that platelets and MK can be transfected in vivo, selectively and at high
efficiency by these approaches, resulting in suppression of target gene expression, altered gene-dependent
functions restricted to platelets and MK, and antithrombotic and antibleeding effects. SOC for thrombosis and
bleeding management continues to be plagued with undesirable counter-effects: increased risk of bleeding
with antithrombotics, and generally poor management of bleeding disorders with blunt, untargeted treatments
that increase risk for thrombosis and other morbidities. The unique ability of MK and platelets to internalize and
utilize naked ds siRNAs - without encapsulation in liposomes or other nanoparticle structures that eliminate
tissue targeting specificity, and without covalent targeting moieties that greatly reduce silencing efficiency –
provides the unprecedented opportunity to develop new antiplatelet drugs via an entirely novel approach to
disease management. The specific goals of this proposal are: 1) to select and characterize naked siRNA
oligonucleotide therapeutics with high efficacy for antithrombotic treatments with improved hemostatic
protection compared to drug blockade; 2) to select and characterize naked siRNA oligonucleotide therapeutics
for antibleeding treatments with improved efficacy over SOC; 3) to determine the timing and efficiencies of
alternative drug administration routes. In Aim 1 we will use in vivo mouse models to select and characterize
lead siRNA compounds for strongest antithrombotic effects, and determine the boundaries of dosing and
timing that do not cause unwanted bleeding (therapeutic windows). We will test two candidate siRNAs:
targeting P2y12, the primary purinergic (ADP) receptor on platelets that is the molecular target of current
frontline antiplatelet drugs, and siRNA targeting PAR4, the low-affinity thrombin receptor in human platelets
that represents a frontier of antiplatelet therapeutic targeting. We will also determine efficacies of intravenous
and subdermal administration routes in this aim. In Aim 2 we will target endogenous negative regulators of
platelet reactivity to select lead siRNAs for antibleeding therapeutics, including testing benefit in mouse models
of acquired and inherited bleeding disorders. Together, these studies will firmly establish and deeply
characterize lead siRNA compositions for pre-clinical development of novel antiplatelet therapeutics."
10894034,"Summary:
PD-1 axis blockers induce durable clinical responses in ~20% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). However, most patients do not benefit from treatment and those who initially respond ultimately
develop acquired resistance. There are limited treatment options for these clinical scenarios. To substantially
reduce NSCLC mortality, it is imperative to: i) Identify novel biomarkers for optimal selection of patients for
treatment; ii) Uncover immunotherapy targets beyond the PD-1/PD-L1 axis that may serve to treat patients with
refractory tumors; and iii) Reveal the role of immunity during tumor progression to design early therapeutic
interventions. Recent studies from our group identified baseline T-cell dysfunction and LAG-3 upregulation as
key determinants for resistance to PD-1 blockade in NSCLC. We have also found that LAG-3 signaling induces
T-cell apoptosis and identified FGL1 as major inhibitory LAG-3 ligand in cancer. We hypothesize that
engagement of the LAG-3/FGL1 pathway mediates dominant immune evasion and T-cell dysfunction/death in a
subset of NSCLCs insensitive to PD-1 therapies. In this project and through 3 complementary aims, we will
leverage our expertise in cancer immunobiology and biomarkers to: i) Determine the biomarker value of
measuring functional TIL profiles in human NSCLC; ii) Analyze the mechanisms and role of LAG-3/FGL1
interaction as immunomodulatory target in human lung malignancies; and iii) Examine the role LAG-3/FGL1
pathway and immune contexture in carcinogenesis and early lung cancer progression. The results from this work
will accelerate translation of research concepts into the clinic for establishment of novel biomarkers, support
interpretation of clinical trials and design optimal treatment modalities for early-stage and advanced lung cancer."
10894625,"Paragons of Conformational Control in Metalloenzyme Reactivity Lisa Olshansky
Project Summary. Recent decades have witnessed a revolution in what was once a static picture of biology.
For example, the tenets of biochemistry once taught that sequence determines structure, but we now know that
sequence and cellular environment determine conformational sampling. Evolutionary selection acts on dynamic
rather than static features. The implications for this dynamic biochemical world permeate all aspects of human
health. Therefore, it is essential that contemporary research explore the roles, mechanisms, and structure-
function paradigms at play therein. However, the complex interplay between structural changes and changes in
reactivity make exploring these paradigms in natural systems incredibly challenging. At the same time, simplified
synthetic models typically fail to capture the key elements of control leveraged in Nature to regulate activity. My
approach is to combine these tactics. By incorporating synthetically prepared metal complexes into proteins that
have evolved to undergo allosterically driven conformational changes, we are preparing switchable artificial
metalloproteins (swArMs) that represent paragons for conformational control in metalloenzyme reactivity. By
creating artificial systems in which changes in structure are directly linked to changes in function, we aim to
quantify the effects of conformational control in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters underlying
reactivity. Ultimately, this understanding can be harnessed in the development of new catalysts, bioimaging
agents, and systems for targeted drug delivery. Our work is poised for the exploration of key unanswered
questions in enzyme catalysis, such as how allosteric binding events are converted into metallocofactor
activation, or how entropic factors regulate radical chemistry, or how energy conversion occurs in mitochondrial
respiratory proteins. Using a wide range of biophysical and spectroscopic methods, swArMs provide a platform
with which to explore all of these questions, and to examine the mechanisms of regulation underlying function
and dysfunction in metalloenzyme reactivity that are critical to human health."

 Replication stress leading to genome instability is an early driver of tumorigenesis and has been
associated with overexpression of oncogenes. In normal cells, activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
pathway serves as a barrier to tumorigenesis leading to cell cycle arrest inducing cellular senescence or cell
death in response to high burden of genome instability. However, in cancer cells upon oncogene-induced
replication stress the protective barrier of DDR, cell death and senescence is bypassed leading to uncontrolled
cell proliferation. Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms that bypass oncogene-induced replication stress and
senescence will help understand the basic science underlying disease progression and will identify new targets
for therapy.
 Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is driven by a chromosomal translocation and in-frame gene fusion between
EWSR1 and ETS family of transcription factors. In majority of the EWS cases, the chromosomal translocation
results in the generation of EWS-FLI1 oncogene. EWS-FLI1 functions as an aberrant transcription factor that
drives the development and progression of EWS. Expression of EWS-FLI1 oncogene leads to oncogene-induced
replication stress and genome instability. However, the molecular mechanism underlying bypass of EWS-FLI1
oncogene-induced replication stress response pathways is largely unknown. Our preliminary data shows that
USP1 deubiquitinase is overexpressed in EWS cell lines and tumors. USP1 regulates DDR and is required for
genome stability and stem cell maintenance. We find that USP1 expression is regulated by EWS-FLI1 in EWS.
Importantly, inhibition of USP1 activity using small molecule USP1 inhibitors resulted in growth arrest of EWS
cell lines indicating that USP1 expression and activity is important for EWS cell proliferation and progression.
Notably, USP1 depletion led to a decrease in the levels of HELLS chromatin remodeling protein. The function of
USP1 or HELLS in EWS pathogenesis has not been investigated. In this study, we will examine the regulation
of HELLS by USP1 deubiquitinase (Aim 1), determine the mechanism by which USP1 promotes EWS cell
proliferation (Aim 2), and determine the effect of USP1 knockdown on EWS tumor formation in vivo and the
efficacy of USP1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs at suppressing EWS cell proliferation
(Aim 3).
 Successful completion of this study will unravel novel mechanistic insights into USP1 mediated bypass
of EWS-FLI1 oncogene-induced replication stress and help evaluate USP1 targeted treatment strategies for
EWS."

Retinopathy is one of the most-feared complications of diabetes. In the pathogenesis of this blinding disease,
retinal mitochondria become dysfunctional, the electron transport chain (ETC) is compromised, superoxide
levels are elevated, and while complex III activity is inhibited, complex I remains unchanged. Mitochondria
have their own small DNA (mtDNA), which lacks protective histones, but is packaged into nucleoids that
provide some protection and assist in its biogenesis. Diabetes damages mtDNA, impairs its biogenesis, and
downregulates gene expression of mtDNA-encoded cytochrome B (CYTB of complex III). Gene expression is
also regulated by long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs), the RNAs with >200 nucleotides and no open reading
frame for translation, but they can bind to DNA or RNA, or can act as scaffolds to promote the interaction of
proteins. Although majority of the LncRNAs are encoded by nuclear DNA, mtDNA also encodes three
LncRNAs, LncND5 and LncND6 for complex I and LncCytB for complex III. Preliminary data show that in
hyperglycemic milieu, while LncCytB is downregulated, LncND5 and LncND6 remain unchanged, and
nucleoids are decreased and mtDNA sensitivity to nuclease digestion is increased. Based on these, our central
hypothesis is that `LncCytB downregulation in diabetes impairs mtDNA nucleoids and attenuates cytochrome B
transcription, damaging the mtDNA and the electron transport chain system, and the damaged mitochondria
lead to the development of retinopathy'.
Aim 1 will investigate the role of LncCytB in nucleoid formation, and the hypothesis predicts that `decrease in
LncCytB in diabetes impairs nucleoids, damaging mtDNA integrity and reducing its copy numbers'. Aim 2 will
examine the role of LncCytB in the regulation of the ETC, and will test the hypothesis that `downregulation of
LncCytB decreases transcription of CYTB, which inhibits the complex III activity and compromises the ETC
system'. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism by which hyperglycemia downregulates LnCytB, and will
examine the role of mitochondrial-targeted RNAse P protein 1 in regulation of LncCytB in the mitochondria.
The plan will employ in vitro (human retinal endothelial cells) and in vivo (retinal microvessels from rodents)
models of diabetic retinopathy, and will utilize fully optimized molecular biological approaches. Our overall goal
is to identify novel regulatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, specifically at
the level of mtDNA-encoded LncRNA in mitochondrial homeostasis. The testable central hypothesis is
innovative, and has significant translational impact as successful completion of our studies will provide strong
background for LncCytB as a potential therapeutic target to prevent the development/ progression of this sight-
threatening disease."
10894633,"Project summary:
 Essential regulation of the cellular machinery is achieved by a network of highly dynamic signaling
molecules, which, when dysregulated, allow cancer cells to misinterpret or ignore signals that normally tell cells
to stop dividing or begin apoptosis, leading to uncontrolled tumor growth. For the last 18 years, my laboratory
has been at the forefront of applying a native biochemistry approach to cell signaling and cancer research. We
have developed enabling technologies, and established spatiotemporal regulation as a fundamental paradigm
in cell signaling, and discovered that its alteration leads to uncontrolled cell growth.
 This NCI R35-supported research program seeks to establish a new conceptual framework to
specifically understand the cellular organization of molecular activities. We hypothesize that cellular
biochemical activities are spatially organized into an “activity architecture” and dysregulated driver molecules
can re-organize and re-structure this activity architecture, leading to loss of control over cell growth, division
and death. In the past 6 years, we published 51 peer-reviewed articles, and made significant advances in
establishing this framework. We developed first-in-class technologies for imaging protein-protein interactions
and enzymatic activities in living cells at molecular length-scales and first kinase biosensor that achieved high-
resolution imaging in awake mice, which have provided evidence for the biochemical activity architecture
across different scales. We also made a breakthrough discovery that a regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A
(PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid-liquid phase-separation (LLPS) to enable the dynamic buffering and spatial
compartmentalization of a ubiquitous second messenger, cAMP, providing an answer to a long standing
question. We further showed that the oncogenic fusion in fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) potently inhibits RIα
LLPS and induces aberrant cAMP signaling, which leads to increased cell proliferation and cell transformation.
We have also discovered novel regulation in the Ras/ERK pathway and developed a novel Ras biosensor. In
the proposed research, we will have three focuses. First, we will develop innovative technologies including
super-resolution activity imaging to illuminate the biochemical activity architecture across different scales.
Secondly, we will elucidate how the disorganized cAMP-PKA activity architecture leads to tumorigenesis in
FLC, and further discover novel, cancer-relevant biomolecular condensates. Thirdly, we will investigate the
spatiotemporal regulation of ERK that is critical for its physiological functions and identify the vulnerable
connections in the re-organized cancer-driving architecture in pancreatic cancer, which is a deadly cancer that
is addicted to the Ras-ERK pathway. We will also facilitate the development of new therapeutics by developing
novel assays for evaluating Ras inhibitors and measuring target engagement."

10894639,"Project Summary
There are two major theories concerning the pathogenesis of ADPKD; the first and most accepted is that an
individual is born with a defective allele and then the normal WT allele undergoes a somatic mutation that gives
rise first to a tubular dilation and then a cyst, the `two hit' hypothesis. The second idea is that gene dosage is
enough to cause disease, the level of the protein product of the PKD1 gene, polycystin-1 (PC1) decreases below
a threshold and cysts appear in a stochastic manner. We wish to investigate these two ideas in a novel manner
using the fact that PC1, PC2 and fibrocystin are all present on an exosome we term the exosome-like vesicle
(ELV). We know that the level of PC1 is decreased in individuals with PKD1 mutations and that the amount of
PC1 per ELV is inversely proportional to height adjust total kidney volume (HtTKV). Observing the total amount
of PC1 in pooled exosomes tells us little about the pathogenesis of the disease. However, a new technology has
become available which allows an investigator to determine the amount of PC1 on individual ELVs, NanoView.
We know that ELVs contain CD133 (prominin) which colocalizes on exosomes with PC1. We predict that if the
`two hit' hypothesis is true, then clones of PKD1 null cells in the kidney will produce ELVs that are CD133+ and
PC1- and that the NanoView will see a bimodal distribution of PC1+ ELVs in ADPKD but not in normal urine.
The ratio of CD133+/PC- to CD133+/PC1+ ELVs will correlate with HtTKV. If haploinsufficiency is the
mechanism, then the mean intensity of PC1 per ELV will be inversely proportional to HtTKV. Thus, NanoView
technology can distinguish between the `two hit' and haploinsufficiency models.
To further dissect the mechanism of haploinsufficiency we will investigate two major ideas. The first is that the
human PKD1 gene is unusual in that it has two long CT rich tracts in introns 21 and 22 which interfere with
splicing and generate a smaller form of PC1, we term Trunc_PC1. We will investigate the possibility that splicing
efficiency correlates inversely with HtTKV. The second idea is that there is person to person variation in PKD1
promoter strength and that the promoter attenuates with age. We will investigate this possibility using real time
RT-PCR. We think that the different mechanisms have a profound effect on the way the disease may be treated.
If haploinsufficiency is correct, then strategies designed to increase the amount of endogenous PKD1 mRNA
and PC1 protein will be appropriate whereas in the `two hit' scenario these strategies will not work and may be
deleterious as both alleles are defective."

Better strategies are needed to improve identification of individuals with FEP and to rapidly engage them in
Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) aimed at restoring functioning. This study will investigate whether a U.S.
adaptation of a successful detection approach from the Netherlands enhanced by an innovative model of
communicating information about psychosis and treatment options to patients and families (ComPsych), can
reduce DUP. Our collaborators in the Netherlands compared screening of a consecutive help-seeking
population entering mental health services to clinician referral from mental health clinics and found that
screening captured significantly more individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) and with FEP. Based
on the Dutch model, within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, we have piloted and established the
feasibility of screening help-seeking youth entering mental health services with the aim of improving early
identification of FEP cases and rapid referral to specialty care (Early Stage Identification and Engagement to
Reduce DUP study (EaSIE), supported by NIMH R34). Individuals entering services are screened with the
Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version (PQ-B). Those who screen positive are assessed by Structured
Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS) and referred to stage-specific specialty care (FEP or CHR
services). To facilitate service engagement we developed, piloted, and established feasibility of the ComPsych
model. While our data showed that compared to clinician referral, systematic screening method (SM) can
substantially reduce DUP by identifying a greater number of patients earlier in the course of illness, more
research is needed to evaluate the impact of ComPsych on FEP treatment initiation and engagement in order
to further reduce DUP. We will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design to compare a
systematic screening and communication method (SCM) to SM. Following a 6-month baseline period of SM,
12 mental health clinics will be randomized (2 clinics at a time) to transition from SM to SCM at 6-month
intervals. In both conditions, individuals aged 12-30 who screen positive on PQ-B will be assessed with SIPS
by trained clinicians in each clinic and referred to FEP and CHR services as appropriate. In SCM condition the
ComPsych model will be used to facilitate initiation of CHR and FEP services. We will measure DUP for
patients who meet psychosis criteria. We hypothesize that: (1) SCM will result in a higher number of individuals
initiating CHR and FEP services compared to SM; (2) The mean DUP of FEP individuals in SCM condition will
be lower than the mean DUP of FEP individuals in SM condition, due to the reduced time to initiate FEP
services. We will also examine multi-level implementation factors that can inform the identification of
implementation strategies for future deployment of SCM in routine practice."

Stroke is the leading cause of motor disability in the United States. While brain stimulation to enhance motor
function after stroke has shown promise in small studies, two recent large stroke trials did not find evidence for
significant benefits. A key uncertainty is about how to exactly tailor brain stimulation to effectively modulate neural
dynamics associated with movement preparation and control. Our recent studies in rats (Ramanathan et al.,
Nature Medicine 2018; Lemke et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2019) demonstrated that population dynamics linked
to low-frequency oscillatory activity (0.5-4Hz “LFO”) are essential for movement control and can serve as a target
for modulation using electrical stimulation. More specifically, cortical stimulation was found to both boost LFO
power and augment motor function. We now also have substantial evidence in a non-human primate model
that such an approach can be effective in more complex brains. However, it is essential to further optimize the
delivery of such stimulation to specifically target cortical dynamics. We thus propose to optimize parameters for
epidural stimulation to selectively modulate population dynamics in the intact motor network. Our approach
entails simultaneous recording of single neurons in the non-human primate motor network along with electrical
stimulation using a customized “ring” of epidural cranial screw electrodes. Moreover, we will use computational
analysis to determine how task-related neural dynamics in a reach-to-grasp task are modulated by electrical
stimulation. More specifically, we will optimize and develop principles for large-scale electrical stimulation to
selectively enhance “neural modes” isolated to M1 or PMd or joint across both areas. This approach is built on
the growing consensus that motor networks perform computations through coordinated ensemble activity or
“neural modes”, i.e. patterns of neural covariation measured with dimensionality reduction methods. Activation
of neural modes (i.e. Neural Model Activation or NMA) appear to constitute building blocks for computations
underlying movement control. Our specific aims are: 1) Determine optimal ACS parameters that increases both
local and cross-area NMA between M1 and PMd during a reach-grasp task; 2) Determine optimal ACS
parameters that increases both local and cross-area NMA between M1 and S1 during a reach-grasp task; 3)
Determine parameters for ACS to enhance task NMA during time periods away from the task. Completion of
these aims will provide critical information for designing therapeutic stimulation that selectively targets population
dynamics in the distributed motor network. The information gained may also help improve methods for non-
invasive brain stimulation."

South Asian individuals (SAs) (individuals from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and
Nepal) have markedly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD),
premature insulin resistance, and higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared with non-Hispanic
White individuals and other groups. The global cardiovascular community has officially
recognized SA ethnicity as a “risk-enhancing factor” in the 2018 ACC/AHA Prevention
Guidelines2 as well as in the QRISK2/3 risk calculator used in the U.K. Reducing ASCVD risk
and mortality from ASCVD in SAs is a clear priority and unmet need. Our team has
demonstrated that advanced measures of lipid metabolism (protective and adverse) are
superior to traditional risk factors and conventional lipids (non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides)
in predicting ASCVD risk. These advanced measures have been studied primarily in those of
European and African descent but not among SAs. Our overall goal is to improve
cardiometabolic risk in SAs. The specific objective of this project is to determine whether
advanced measures of lipoprotein metabolism explain the excess cardiometabolic risk in SAs.
We will leverage the NHLBI-supported Mediators of Atherosclerosis in SAs Living in America
(MASALA), the largest longitudinal cohort of U.S. SAs with extensive cardiometabolic
phenotyping (N=1,164) and compare these findings to similarly phenotyped White, Black,
Hispanic, and Chinese participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA,
N=6814). We will utilize the UK Biobank to ascertain metabolomic signatures of SAs and
incident ASCVD and diabetes (N=8,762 SAs vs. 472,780 Europeans). Aim 1: Determine the
association between advanced measures of lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic phenotypes
in SAs. Aim 2: Determine the association between advanced measures of lipoprotein
metabolism and subclinical plaque prevalence and progression and incident ASCVD in SAs.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the metabolomic signatures of South Asians compared to non-SAs
with respect to cardiometabolic phenotypes. The proposed studies are expected to provide
critical insights into the link between advanced protective and adverse measures of lipoprotein
metabolism and excess cardiometabolic risk in SAs and may eventually lead to better clinical
biomarkers specific to SAs as well as to novel interventions targeting these lipoprotein markers
in SAs. Given the excessive burden of ASCVD and diabetes in SAs, this proposal may have a
large public health benefit to this less studied but high-risk ethnic group."

MicroRNAs have been studied for over two decades and found to impact extensively on various
cellular functions like differentiation, proliferation and oncogenesis through regulation of gene
expression using the Argonaute (Ago) containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In
the cell, however, microRNAs co-exist with a nearly equal abundance of non-canonical short
RNAs (ncsRNAs) that were not believed to enter the RISC. This has begun to change with our
discovery that some members of the ncsRNAs, the tRNA derived fragments (tRFs) enter into
RISC and silence gene expression, and others do not. The 18-26 base long tRF-3a molecules
are derived from tRNAs by processes very different from the biogenesis of microRNAs, and yet
repress gene expression by incorporation into Ago-RISC (RISC). In Aim 1 we will focus on
specific tRF sub-classes, tRF-3b and tRF-1, that do not enter into Ago-RISC, to identify the
surveillance pathways that keep short RNAs from dysregulating gene expression through RISC.
We will study a methyltransferase that inactivates tRF-3b molecules by modifications on the
RNA, a modification that is also regulated by demethylases that are inactivated by Isocitrate
Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, seen in many cancers. We will also focus on an RNAse that
degrades tRF-1 molecules to prevent them from entering into RISC and silencing gene
expression. The results will reveal how the surveillance mechanisms work and how pathogenic
or therapeutic alteration of the surveillance mechanisms will alter gene expression and improve
RNA mediated therapy. In Aim 2 we will turn to ncsRNAs, exemplified by three tRF-3a
molecules, that enter into RISC, silence gene expression and alter phenotypes of cancers and
cancer cell-lines. We will test whether even in these cell line the tRF-3a molecules regulate
gene expression by hijacking microRNA specific mechanisms and thus alter cellular
phenotypes. We will also determine whether the ncsRNAs help or hinder microRNAs from
doing their function. The field of short RNA mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation will be
altered fundamentally by the recognition that microRNAs work in a complex milieu of other short
RNAs that compete with or assist microRNAs, and that the cell has evolved mechanisms to
protect the integrity of microRNA-mediated gene regulation."
10864309,"This application is a request for funds to acquire a Zeiss Axioscan 7 slide scanner for the Structural and
Functional Imaging Core at the Burke Neurological Institute. The Institute, dedicated to finding cures for
chronic neurological disabilities, requires an automated image acquisition system to advance their NIH-funded
research. The mandate of the Imaging Core facility is to provide access to a range of light microscopy systems
and provide technical assistance with image acquisition, processing, and analysis to all research groups within
BNI. While the Institute has invested in high-resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopy systems, it lacks
modern epifluorescence and brightfield imaging systems. Existing microscopy solutions are aging and lack
critical features found in the proposed Axioscan 7 system. This scarcity of resources poses a significant
bottleneck for the diverse NIH-funded research programs at the Institute. The Axioscan 7 slide scanner, with its
automated full slide workflow, unlimited z-stack acquisition parameters, and advanced deconvolution
algorithms, offers an optimal combination of features for large area tissue scanning and stitching. The
proposed system will greatly expedite research progress by reducing active user time during image acquisition.
Furthermore, the surrounding area lacks other automated, high-throughput microscopy resources accessible to
BNI investigators, making the Axioscan 7 an indispensable asset. Its implementation will not only benefit
currently NIH-funded research programs but also catalyze the progress of studies that are yet to reach the
maturity required for NIH funding. The proposed research projects underscore the shared need for an
advanced slide scanning system. In conclusion, the extensive capabilities and efficient workflow of the
Axioscan 7 will exert a sustained, powerful influence on the conduct of NIH-funded research programs at the
Burke Neurological Institute and support breakthroughs in the understanding and treatment of chronic
neurological disabilities."

Research: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that often leads to disability and reduced
health-related quality of life. Even with recommended therapy, less than 40% of patients achieve treatment
targets such as minimal disease activity (MDA). We previously showed that 73% of patients with PsA experience
poor sleep quality compared to 27% of “healthy controls”, and that poor sleep quality is associated with markers
of disease activity such as swollen joint counts and pain. Furthermore, our qualitative research suggests a
bidirectional relationship between PsA disease activity and sleep quality. Our proposed 12-month longitudinal
prospective study will document both objective (i.e., actigraphy) and subjective (i.e., sleep diaries and
questionnaires) measures of sleep, novel serum inflammatory markers, and achievement of MDA to test the
overarching hypothesis that sleep quality and disease activity are bidirectionally associated, and that these
associations are mediated by systemic inflammation. Specifically, we will determine whether (1). poor sleep
quality (exposure) reduces the probability of achieving sustained MDA (outcome), (2). moderate-to-high disease
activity (exposure) reduces the probability of achieving sustained good sleep quality (outcome), and (3) that
systemic inflammation is a mediator in the causal pathway of these associations. The overarching goals of this
proposal are to a) better understand the relationship between sleep and PsA disease activity to support the
development and testing of interventions to improve sleep health and short and long-term outcomes in PsA and
b) provide a training vehicle for Dr. Perez Chada to become an independent investigator. Candidate: Dr. Perez
Chada is a dermatologist with current expertise in psoriatic disease and outcome measures research.
Environment: Dr. Klerman, the candidate’s primary mentor, and her co-mentors (Dr. Alexis Ogdie, Dr. Monika
Haack, and Dr. Joseph Merola) have directly supervised the training of numerous successful junior faculty
members. Harvard Medical School and its hospitals and its Division of Sleep Medicine (DSM) offer a rich training
environment including resources and expertise. These are available in the NIH-supported DSM Research
Training Program in Sleep, Circadian and Respiratory Neurobiology; the Harvard School of Public Health; and
Harvard Catalyst. Combined with the expertise available in her mentors’ lab, these opportunities will be important
training for Dr. Perez Chada’s career. Career Development: Dr. Perez Chada’s long-term career goal is to
become an R01-funded independent, patient-oriented physician-scientist. Dr. Perez Chada’s training will focus
on sleep physiology and analysis, advanced biostatical and epidemiological techniques, mechanisms of
inflammation, and rheumatology. Completion of the proposed research and career development plan will give
the candidate the knowledge and skills to be uniquely positioned to lead research in sleep health and its
relationship(s) with skin and musculoskeletal chronic inflammatory disease."
10864339,"Retinal photoreceptors are specialized neurons responsible for detection and primary processing of the
information entering the eye in the form of light. These first steps of vision take place in the photoreceptor outer
segment, which contains proteins performing visual signal transduction. It is connected to the cell soma (or the
inner segment) through the connecting cilium, which serves as a trafficking route for the outer segment
proteins synthesized in the inner segment. The cellular structures immediately adjacent to the connecting
cilium are also engaged in performing critical photoreceptor functions. At the distal end of the connecting cilium
is the site of photoreceptor disc morphogenesis where several dozen new discs are formed on a daily basis to
sustain the ever-going process of outer segment renewal. At the proximal end of the connecting cilium, there
are structures forming a sorting gate that regulates the outer segment entry and exclusion of membrane
proteins. Defects in any of these processes have been implicated in a wide range of photoreceptor
degenerative diseases. Despite many proteins already being mapped to the connecting cilium and other parts
of the outer-inner segment junction using conventional biochemical and genetic approaches, our knowledge of
the protein composition of this cellular region remains far from complete, which hinders the progress in
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, sorting, outer segment maintenance and disc
morphogenesis. The goal of this proposal is to reduce this knowledge gap by characterizing the unique
proteome of the photoreceptor outer-inner segment junction. In Aim 1, we will employ a cutting-edge
application of quantitative proteomics, called protein correlation profiling. Unlike traditional biochemical
techniques, this methodology allows analyzing the unique protein composition of subcellular structures that can
be enriched but not purified, as in the case of the connecting cilium and its adjacent regions. We will obtain thin
serial tangential sections through the outer-inner segment region of a frozen flat-mounted retina and
characterize the protein composition of these sections using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. The
resulting protein distribution profiles will be compared to those of well-characterized connecting cilium markers.
Proteins distributed similarly to these markers will be considered as candidate unique components of the outer-
inner segment junction, and their localization will be verified using immunolocalization techniques. In Aim 2, we
will employ a novel, highly accurate approach of multiplex protein quantification to simultaneously determine
absolute amounts of large groups of previously known and newly identified proteins residing at this cellular
location. This analysis will suggest which proteins may exist within multi-subunit stoichiometric complexes
and/or specific subcellular structures, thereby facilitating uncovering their functional roles. The information
generated in this resource- and hypothesis-generating study will undoubtedly facilitate the efforts of many
laboratories addressing a broad array questions related to photoreceptor biology and disease."
10864582,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Choosing the more effective therapy is imperative for borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). BRPC is
a subcategory of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (about 20% of the entire PDAC cases). BRPC contacts
peripancreatic arteries and/or veins but has the potential to be successfully resected after downstaging with
effective neoadjuvant therapy. Currently, there are two first-line therapeutic options for BRPC patients, nab-
paclitaxel with gemcitabine and FOLFIRINOX. Overall response rates of these regimens are comparable (20-
30%), and there are no robust data favoring one over the other.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has the potential as a non-invasive tool
for early evaluation of PDAC response to chemotherapy. PDAC is typically hypo-perfused due to significant
tumor sclerosis creating elevated interstitial pressure and consequently compressing tumor-feeding vessels.
However, an effective therapy induces acute necrosis, reducing interstitial pressure and increasing perfusion.
As DCE-MRI can measure tissue perfusion by monitoring the dynamic change of MRI contrast agents introduced
intravenously, it can detect perfusion increase in responding PDAC before the morphological change of tumors.
However, variability in quantitative DCE-MRI measurement remains a concern.
We developed a perfusion phantom named P4 (Point-of-care Portable Perfusion Phantom) to reduce the
variability in quantitative DCE-MRI measurement. The reproducibility of quantitative DCE-MRI measurement
(e.g., volume transfer constant: Ktrans) of various abdominal tissues across three MRI scanners significantly
increased after P4-based error correction (Intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.39 vs. 0.98).
We demonstrated that quantitative DCE-MRI could be used to identify the early therapeutic response of PDAC
after P4-based error correction. In our pilot study, DCE-MRI was applied for 20 PDAC patients before and 6-8
weeks after therapy initiation. The Ktrans of pancreatic tumors favorably responding to chemotherapy increased
84±26% (n=11) after P4-based error correction, while that of non-responding tumors did not (-7±11%) (n=9)
(p<0.0001). We achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating between responding and non-responding tumors.
We hypothesize that DCE-MRI-guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy will improve the negative margin (R0)
resection rate for BRPC patients when the P4 is used for correcting errors in the imaging data. We propose to
switch the first-line therapeutic regimen to the second one if the Ktrans in the tumor increases more than the
threshold. We will compare the R0 resection rate of the group that received DCE-MRI-guided neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with that of the historical control group that received standard-of-care treatment (primary endpoint).
Also, we will determine whether quantitative DCE-MRI can be a reliable tool for assessing pancreatic tumor
microenvironment after P4-based error correction using digital histopathology (secondary endpoint)."
10864646,"Project Summary
The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2060, affecting
about 14 million Americans. As ADRD progresses, symptoms worsen, putting informal caregivers (ICs) in charge
of tending to patients' needs. The majority of ICs are unprepared for the challenges of ADRD and are unaware
that the condition is fatal. Although advance care planning (ACP) discussions about goals and care are
encouraged, studies have revealed that they do not promote end-of-life (EOL) conversations. Clinicians do not
have enough time for in-depth discussions and when they do occur, they are one-time events during the initial
diagnosis when ICs are distressed and overwhelmed. We propose developing shared medical appointments
(SMAs), which are billable, group appointments in which participants are encouraged to ask questions and share
their concerns and experiences. SMAs are an ideal environment for EOL discussions because barriers such as
different cultural perspectives, health literacy, and time constraints are all addressed. The long-term goal of the
proposed study is to conduct a randomized control trial of SMAs across several hospitals to determine if they
facilitate increased knowledge about ADRD and promote goal-concordant about EOL issues. The objective of
this proposal is to identify the most significant EOL concerns in order to create a SMA that includes culturally
sensitive appropriate content and is mindful of various health literacy levels. We will conduct surveys and
interviews to identify topics, then consult ADRD and caregiving experts about the structure of the SMA, and
evaluate the SMA using pre/post measures. The rationale of this proposal is that by allocating time and space
to discuss ADRD's progression toward EOL in an environment where knowledge, concerns, and experiences
can be exchanged, effective advance care planning will occur. PI Alpert is an expert in health communication
and qualitative research methods. His mentorship team includes experts in quantitative research methods,
intervention development, and evaluation (Dr. Rothberg), health literacy and EOL decision-making (Dr. Paasche-
Orlow), and palliative care communication (Dr. Wittenberg). Our study is innovative because we will solicit
recommendations from multiple stakeholders about informational and communication needs about ADRD and
EOL, and then use those recommendations to construct a new method of care (SMA) for eliciting EOL
preferences. The proposed study is significant because, while discussions about EOL care are encouraged,
current ACP practices fail to achieve goal-concordant treatment. SMAs enhance learning and support, increase
trust, and are widely accepted by physicians. This project is expected to have a positive impact by providing
evidence for the development of additional ADRD SMAs to increase understanding, improve family and patient-
clinician communication, inform attitudes toward palliative care and hospice, and overall, encourage thoughtful
discussions about approaching EOL."

Research (formerly Maine Medical Center Research Institute). Currently, it consists of a magnetic resonance
imager (MRI), a high-resolution ultrasound system, and a microcomputed tomography (microCT) system. The
MRI was acquired in 2005, is at the end of its serviceable life and currently being decomissioned, and the
Scanco vivaCT40, which was acquired in 2008, has also reached the end of its serviceable life. We propose to
merge the imaging services we provide using a new state-of-the-art, high resolution, preclinical microCT
system. This proposal requests funds to replace our Scanco vivaCT40 microCT system with a Bruker
SkyScan1276 CMOS microCT. Our faculty have strong, NIH-funded programs and centers that rely on high
resolution imaging of calcified and soft tissues, with corresponding quantitative analysis. Since the
development of our Small Animal Imaging Facility, we have supported all of our institutional investigators, and
developed a wide user-base of external clients who utilize our imaging services. Our microCT currently
supports projects from 15 major and 3 minor users, with a total of 8 R01 funded projects and 2 COBRE
supported junior investigators. In addition, we provide significant support to 3 junior investigators, who recently
received their first R01 grants. We have attracted external clients within New England and other states. In
particular, the University of Vermont and their clinical and translational research program strongly supports this
proposal due to the lack of microCT services in their local area.
 The Bruker SkyScan1276 CMOS is a desktop, pre-clinical microCT system with a resolution of 3µm
and scan speeds as fast as 3.9 seconds. It provides a field of view with a length of up to 210mm to allow whole
mouse and small rat imaging. The system is versatile for ex vivo specimen bone imaging and in vivo imaging
due to the sliding scale adjustment of the peak energy from 40-100kV. Additional filter sets allow fine tuning of
the energy level to very low dose settings. The 3D.Suite imaging software is state-of-the-art, with sophisticated
and user friendly automated image analysis. This software provides easy image adjustments without the need
to write new image analysis algorithm, as is needed on the comparable new Scanco system.
 The institutional support for our Small Animal Imaging core has been very strong over the last almost
two decades with service contracts and personnel costs covered by MaineHealth and this support will continue
to provide operational funds for this new microCT system. We have assembled a strong advisory team with
external and internal members to assist with scientific as well as administrative core related issues. In
summary, we request funds to purchase a Bruker SkyScan1276 CMOS system to maintain high level imaging
services to our clients that supports NIH level funding, enables grant renewal and allows this core facility to
remain competitive."
10882205,"Project Abstract
Severe hemorrhage is a life-threatening condition that often occurs in trauma. Hemorrhagic shock and the
hypotension and tissue ischemia that results is associated with endothelial damage and dysfunction that is
thought to contribute to associated complications and death. Recently, it has been appreciated that a
proteoglycan structure that lines blood vessels, known as the endothelial glycocalyx, is damaged during
trauma and hemorrhage. This glycocalyx damage is thought to contribute to generalized blood vessel
disfunction, multi-organ failure, and coagulopathy, together termed the Endotheliopathy of Trauma. Trauma
patients with high plasma glycocalyx components die at higher rates, both due to uncontrolled hemorrhage, as
well as an increase in multi-organ failure. Despite the potential importance of this mechanism, signaling events
leading to acute endothelial glycocalyx shedding are largely undefined. We have previously found that
metabolism of the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate drives the acute shedding of the glycocalyx. We also
observed an increase in membrane lysophospholipids in a cell culture model of hypoxia-reoxygenation, as well
as increases in the interaction between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the glycocalyx constituent
syndecan-1. These findings led us to hypothesize that the increased succinate metabolism during hemorrhage-
resuscitation causes reactive oxygen species production and lipid oxidation, which leads to phospholipase A2-
mediated generation of lysophospholipids and plasma membrane reorganization, allowing MMPs to degrade
the glycocalyx. We propose that a specialized protein-lipid domain forms in the plasma membrane consisting
of lysophospholipids, MMPs, and glycocalyx proteins, which we term a “sheddosome” domain. In two specific
aims, we will 1.) Determine how membrane reorganization mediates glycocalyx shedding through the formation
of “sheddosome” domains in a general hypoxia-reoxygenation model. 2.) Determine how lysophospholipid-
mediated membrane reorganization leads to the endotheliopathy of trauma. This work will define a mechanism
by which alterations in succinate metabolism drive changes in membrane structure, leading to glycocalyx
damage, coagulopathy, and organ failure. This new knowledge of the acute vascular events in traumatic
hemorrhage will inform future therapies to increase survival in these patients."

Protein synthesis begins via a multi-step and highly-regulated process that culminates with a ribosome poised
at a start site on a messenger RNA (mRNA). Loss of control is broadly implicated in human disease, including
cancers, developmental disorders, neurological diseases, and viral infections. Since translation initiation is rate
limiting, an important regulatory strategy involves multi-protein complexes recruited to the opposite end of the
mRNA. Recruited regulatory proteins directly enhance or inhibit assembly of the initiation machinery on the
mRNA, thereby tuning protein production up or down. Many molecular mechanisms that underlie translation
initiation and its long-range control remain unclear. Current paradigms rely on analyses of complexes that are
stable for minutes to hours, as the intrinsic dynamics challenge approaches in bulk solutions. Here, I build off
my initial postdoctoral research to track the human translation initiation machinery, mRNA, and regulatory
complexes as they interact using single-molecule spectroscopy and purified components in vitro, which I
complement with structural analyses. In Aim 1 (K99), I focus on how the ribosomal subunits are recruited to
and load onto an mRNA, and determine how these landmark initiation events are dictated by mRNA features.
In Aim 2 (K99), I examine how the final initiation steps and the transition into active protein synthesis are
coordinated and governed by a universally-conserved GTPase, eIF5B. In Aim 3 (R00), I leverage the obtained
training and expertise to examine how translation initiation is controlled via the 3’-end of the mRNA by the
CCR4-NOT complex, a major regulator with human-health relevance. As my preliminary data demonstrate, my
strategy will overcome previous roadblocks to provide a dynamic view of key molecular branchpoints that
underlie translation initiation, reveal how they are targeted for control, and may define molecular bases of
disease. Aided by strong collaborations and my mentoring team, the proposed research and training plan will
provide me with new conceptual and experimental expertise in structural biology and biophysics and enhance
my professional development. Together, this proposal will serve as a strong foundation as I transition into
independence and continue my investigation of translational control and how it goes awry in human disease."

development of an innovative, integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to produce a cadre of well-trained,
skilled, collaborative scientists and clinician scientists that are capable to address the critical dental, oral
and craniofacial research issues of our nation. This renewal is a continuation of our NIDCR T-90
(DE022736) /R90 (DE023056) DART Training Program that was built on our prior T-32 DART Program
(DE017607-05). Furthermore, our training experience is the culmination of prior successful NIDCR T32
Research Training programs: Post-doctoral Training in Oral Health (T32-DE14300); Post-Doctoral Training
in Caries Research (T32-DE007026); and a Short-Term Research Training for Health Professional Students
(T35-DK07545; funded for over forty years). This robust experience has led to a successful innovative
training program designed to enhance the knowledge of dentists, graduate students, dual degree
(DMD/PhD) students, and postdoctoral fellows in basic, clinical, and translational research providing a
pathway to productive, independent dental academic careers with unique acquired skill sets in
grantsmanship and leadership.
The DART Program offers four training tracks: Track I- DMD/Ph.D; Track II- Pre-doctoral Ph.D.; Track III-
Post-doctoral training for foreign trained dentists; and Track IV- Post-doctoral training. Integrative DART
core experiences include: 1) Presentation skills; 2) Research knowledge; 3) Leadership and Networking
development; 4) Responsible Conduct of Research training; 5) Grant Writing skills; and 6) Individualized
Development Plans. The primary objective of the DART is to provide a broadened interdisciplinary research
experience for exceptionally motivated trainees in a research-intensive collaborative academic university
environment. Research training is provided in one of the SOD's five programmatic research themes: 1)
Microbiology/Immunology; 2) Craniofacial Genetics/Developmental Biology; 3) Biomaterial Science/
Biomimetics; 4) Orofacial Cancers; and 5) Implementation Science/Clinical Outcomes Research. The UAB
SOD is uniquely positioned to provide training for the next generation of academicians since we are ranked
among the top ten in NIDCR research funding and host the NIDCR National Dental Practice Based
Research Network (U19-DE022736). The SOD is an integral component of a major southeast regional

which trainees examine infectious diseases from a translational perspective by shadowing an Infectious
Diseases physician in the clinics and connecting basic research with clinical practice in journal club
discussion sessions. Trainees also gain experience in selecting, hosting, and enhanced exposure to
MMMP sponsored external speaker, which brings diverse and innovative investigators to campus as role
models for career development. Finally, trainees develop essential communication skills by participating in
an on campus science communication workshop before engaging with the public in a variety of outreach
opportunities. New initiatives in the upcoming funding period include having an annual IDP “party”, an
annual MMMP on site retreat, and implementation of exit surveys. Introduction of these new activities is
expected to further enhance the MMMP training experience as a means toward attaining trainee career

are prototypical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands (e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD))
have been demonstrated to suppress humoral immunity in laboratory animals and suggested by
epidemiological evidence. The overall goal of this research is to define the molecular mechanism(s)
responsible for AHR agonist-mediated suppression of antibody production by human primary B cells. Prior
studies comparing activated mouse, rat and human primary B cells, RNAseq showed a small number of
differentially expressed genes by TCDD. One gene that was only differentially regulated in human B cells
compared to mouse and rat was the lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK). While LCK is
expressed by T cells, subpopulations of B cells also express LCK, specifically CD5+ B cells. We have shown
that decreased IgM secretion by TCDD is due, in part, to selective effects on CD5+ B cells, termed innate-like B
(ILB) cells. Although CD5+ ILBs constitute approximately 10-25% of circulating B cells and are the source for
the majority of circulating IgM in the absence of an immune response. Further, CD5+ ILBs are the primary B
cell type mediating humoral immunity early and late in life when the adaptive immune system is still developing
or during late life stages when adaptive immunity is in decline. Protein analysis also showed induction by
TCDD of LCK, the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L2 on CD5+ ILBs. Induction of PD-1 and PD-L2
are especially important as they provide a mechanism for the suppression of the IgM response by AHR
activation in CD5+ ILBs. LCK can phosphorylate the inhibitory region of the PD-1 receptor, facilitating immune
suppression by PD-1. Inhibition of LCK activity protected CD5+ B cells from IgM suppression by TCDD,
demonstrating LCK is critically involved. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis: AHR-mediated suppression of
IgM occurs through induction of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and LCK, a kinase known to initiate PD-1-
mediated immune regulation, preferentially on human primary CD5+ (innate-like) B cells. Specific Aim (SA) 1
will characterize human CD5+ (innate-like) B cells as a highly sensitive population susceptible to suppression
by AHR ligands. SA2 is to identify the role of induced checkpoint inhibitor, PD-1, and tyrosine kinase, LCK, in
TCDD-mediated suppression of IgM production by CD5+ B cells. Completion of the above aims has a strong
potential to: (a) define B cell population(s) highly sensitive to impairment by AHR ligands critical for immunity
against common pathogens; (b) identify a novel mechanism of immunotoxicity involving upregulation of the
inhibitory receptor, PD-1; (c) characterize the role of LCK in IgM suppression by AHR activation using IFNγ as
a molecular probe; (d) utilize percent circulating CD5+ B cells as biomarker of sensitive populations to
suppression of IgM by AHR ligands and (e) results for this experimental plan will be used to develop a
calibrated TCDD PBPK model for risk assessment in collaboration with the Computational Modeling Core."
10877987,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Thyroid hormones (TH) act to regulate energy balance throughout the body by controlling energy expenditure
inside each cell. Circulating levels of TH are controlled through hormone production and feedback in the
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis with the liver also playing a significant role. Diverse classes of
chemicals cause TH imbalance through modulations of molecular targets involved in TH synthesis, transport,
reception, metabolism, recycling, and feedback. Neurodevelopmental deficits, developmental hearing and vision
dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and cancer among other harms are attributed to TH imbalance. Polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) cause TH imbalance in human populations and animal models
although the mechanism is unresolved. The long-standing mechanistic paradigm whereby PCDD/Fs activate the
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in hepatocytes inducing TH-glucuronide formation and clearance has recently
been put into question based on data generated in glucuronidation deficient rodent models. This project aims to
elucidate the mechanism by which PCDD/F exposures disrupt human thyroid kinetics and action through the co-
development of computational models and a microphysiological thyrocyte/hepatocyte screening model that
together can support risk-assessment by bridging experimental data in human based culture systems with a
population level understanding of potential effects on human health. To elucidate the mechanism of PCDD/F
induced thyroid imbalance, we model thyroid catabolism and action in human hepatocytes and determine effects
of PCDD/Fs exposure. To broaden assay coverage, we develop and test a thyrocyte/hepatocyte model that
incorporates TH synthesis. To determine the potential for synergistic effects between PCDD/Fs and commonly
co-exposed chemicals acting through alternate molecular initiating events, we test targeted chemical mixtures.
In addition to hypothesis testing, this proposal refines computational and microphysiological models to evaluate
the effects of chemicals on human thyroid signaling that could be used by stakeholders in the regulatory,
research and regulated community. The improved predictive potential of microphysiological in vitro chemical
testing linked through computational modeling to population health outcomes is a critical step toward supporting
PCDD/F risk-assessment. Improved risk-assessment can then guide targeted intervention strategies that
prevent adverse health effects in sensitive populations."
10877989,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypercholesterolemia, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and diabetes have increased in the
US population to epidemic proportions. Accumulating epidemiological evidence and rodent studies link
environmental pollutants and dietary chemicals to NAFLD progression. Many environmental contaminants,
including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds are ligands for the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). TCDD also disrupts the expression of genes involved in metabolism such as 3-
Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
Interestingly, environmental exposure to TCDD and related compounds decrease serum cholesterol levels in
humans which has been linked to metabolic dysfunction, hepatotoxicity and NAFLD progression. Preliminary
studies also show that inhibition of HMGCR activity via statin co-treatment decreased TCDD-induced
hepatosteatosis, but exacerbated TCDD-induced toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest a strong
relationship between AHR activation, cholesterol homeostasis and NAFLD progression. This has led us to
hypothesize that changes in cholesterol homeostasis alters sensitivity to TCDD and related compound
elicited hepatotoxicity and NAFLD pathogenesis. Specific Aim 1 will use in vitro experiments examining the
link between AHR signaling, HMGCR activity, and intermediate metabolism. Specific Aim 2 will examine the
effects of TCDD on HMGCR activity in the absence and presence of simvastatin co-exposure, during AHR-
mediated progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Results from these specific aims will be
integrated to elucidate the cell-specific metabolic changes that affect TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity and NAFLD
progression. Collaborations with Project 1 (Kaminski) and Project 2 (Johnson), will further characterize the role
of infiltrating immune cell populations and the impact of TCDD on hepatocyte mitochondria and energetics.
These studies will also determine if prescribed statin type drugs increase the risk of hepatotoxicity and NAFLD
development due to persistent exposure to TCDD and related compounds. Currently, more than 40 million
Americans are prescribed statins every year. Consequently, the importance of assessing this risk cannot be
overstated, and warrants further investigation."
10877991,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs, also abbreviated as
PCDD/F) are among the most challenging environmental contaminants. Over the past 20 years, anaerobic
microorganisms such as Dehalococcoides mccartyi and enrichments have been shown to use a number of
PCDD/Fs as electron acceptors. Under laboratory conditions, the respiration rates of these organohalide
respiring bacteria (OHRB) yield PCDD/F half-lives of the order of months to a few years. Hence, OHRB, if
stimulated, can play a larger role in attenuating PCDD/Fs in situations where more intrusive solutions such as
dredging and capping are not practicable because of cost or other factors. The ability of D. mccartyi to respire
PCDD/Fs is closely linked to the high numbers of cobalt-containing proteins (mostly reductive dehalogenases -
RdhAs), the genes and proteins associated with the salvaging pathway for cobalamins, and hydrogenases - to
utilize the electron donor (H2). All three are critical subunits of the respiration complex. Cobalamins are corrinoids
(compounds containing four reduced pyrrole rings with cobalt at the center of the ring) with 5,6-
dimethylbenzimidazol (5,6-DMBI) as the lower ligand. A Cbl with cyanide as the upper ligand of cobalt is called
CN-Cbl or vitamin B12 (B12). All PCDD/F respirers known so far are auxotroph for Cbl. They cannot synthesize
Cbl and must salvage it using the Cbl salvage pathway. Yet, Chloroflexi – the phylum all D. mccartyi belong to
has the highest number of cobalt-containing genes (mostly rdhs) among all known bacteria and archaea. The
potential for the presence of OHRB at the two Superfund sites - Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers, MI (TR/SR),
and Passaic River, NJ (PR) is high. Our work has already identified a dominant phylotype, PRdAO, at the PR
site. Overall, these OHRB combined with amendments including activated carbon (AC), hydrogen release
compounds (HRC), and B12 have the potential to reduce the overall toxicity equivalency quotient (TEQ) and
health risks associated with PCDD/Fs. Such AC-based approaches are already being implemented for other
organohalides such as polychlorinated biphenyls. Integrative mathematical models play a key role in developing
optimal solutions for PCDD/F remediation. Accordingly, this project has the following four specific aims: i)
Quantify the parameters for integrative remediation of PCDD/Fs in the presence of exogenous B12, HRC, D.
mccartyi, and AC, ii) Identify native OHRB and Rdhs-mediated pathways for dechlorination and detoxification of
PCDD/Fs at the TR/SR/PR Superfund sites, iii) Determine the effect of AC, bioaugmentation, and salinity on
native PCDD/F-dechlorinating OHRB, dechlorination pathways, and rates in microcosms, iv) Develop and
validate site-specific integrative remediation models for PCDD/F involving biotic and abiotic interventions. This
new comprehensive model integrates the collective knowledge into a mathematical tool for predicting reduction
in TEQ and health risk in response to interventions. Overall, this project provides novel and powerful approaches,
design principles, and site-specific models for economical remediation of PCDD/Fs."
10877992,"Due to their exceptionally low water solubilities, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs) are
strongly and extensively bound to the solid particles of sediments and soils, especially charcoal-like pyrogenic
carbonaceous matter (PCM, [1]), amorphous organic matter (AOM), and clay minerals. The United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conservatively assumes that 100% of soil-bound PCDD/Fs are
bioavailable to mammals, including humans [2], while measured bioavailabilities of PCDD/Fs in real soils are far
lower [3-13]. Real mammalian bioavailabilities are poorly understood, but we have recently advanced the science
of PCDD/F bioavailability from soils by relating it to the properties of individual particle types: We have shown
that PCDDs that are bound to AOM, clay minerals, or porous-silica particles are indeed 100% bioavailable
(relative to those in corn oil) [14-18]. In contrast, we showed that PCDDs bound to a special kind of PCM called
activated carbon (AC) had bioavailabilities of zero to mice [19, 20] and protected mammalian health. Our recent
work provides two hypotheses to inform risk assessment and remediation strategies for PCDD/F-contaminated
sites: 1) Low levels of PCM are ubiquitous in soils and sediments, so AC-like domains in PCM may be
responsible for lowering the mammalian bioavailabilities of PCDD/Fs in real soils, and 2) Our understanding of
soil particle types simplifies the complexity of soils enough that we can directly and mechanistically test whether
AC amendment of PCDD/F-contaminated soils has potential to be protective of human and ecosystem health by
minimizing mammalian bioavailability. Remediation using AC amendment was proposed long ago, because it is
far cheaper and less environmentally disruptive than removing contaminated soils to hazardous-waste landfills,
but regulators cannot adopt AC as a remedy because no one has shown that AC amendments are truly protective
of mammalian and human health. We propose a set of experiments designed to rigorously test the hypothesis
that PCDDs bound to AC amendments are no longer bioavailable to mammals, and thereby help USEPA and
state regulators critically assess this promising treatment for remediation of PCDD/F-contaminated Superfund
sites: We will track the full mass balance of PCDDs in soils after AC has been added, and then administer these
soils orally to mice and measure PCDD bioavailability and mass balance in the mice. For the first time, we will
directly measure the kinetics of PCDD accumulation in AC amendments and compare these with measured
kinetics of soil-PCDD mammalian bioavailability. This work will inform risk assessment by supplying data for six
practical criteria that EPA uses [21] to select Superfund remedies, including whether AC amendments are likely
to protect human and ecosystem health, the kinetics of their short-term bioavailability reduction, and the longer-
term stabilities of PCDD-AC complexes once they form. In sum, Project 5 will collaborate with the rest of the
Center to transform the experimental basis for regulatory decision-making about AC amendment as a potential
low-cost remediation treatment for PCDD/F-contaminated Superfund sites."

The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will coordinate data management and analysis within the
Michigan State University Superfund Research Center (MSU SRC) to support the identification of sensitive
populations and reduce exposure to toxic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. Implementation of a
comprehensive data management and analysis plan (DMAP) will encourage data sharing and interoperability,
and promote the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles. DMAC will
facilitate the collection of MSU SRC data sets into a center-based data commons to support data exploration,
visualization, and analysis. Using established minimum information requirement standards and ontologies,
DMAC will capture the essential information required to enable reproduction of the processes used to create and
analyze MSU SRC datasets, and facilitate reproducible results for the translation of research to practice. Data
quality assurance processes will ensure sharing of high quality data between projects and cores, as well as with
other centers and stakeholders. To accomplish these objectives, DMAC will: (i) Implement the Investigation
Study Assay (ISA) framework for the collection of data and metadata from projects and cores. This framework
promotes the use of data standards and ontologies which are critical for the application of FAIR principles. The
ISA infrastructure will be used to collect, validate, and archive all data produced by the MSU SRC. (ii) Establish
a center-based data commons using the open source Gen3 data commons framework which co-locates data,
analysis tools, and computational resources. The data commons will enhance data interoperability and sharing
through a web-based user interface and standardized data model, and will be used to integrate the disparate
datasets generated by the SRC. (ii) Institute quality assurance and quality control procedures and processes to
assure data set integrity, and that curated data sets are consistently used and understood across all projects
and cores, and (iv) Provide center-wide training in data management and analysis principles. Training activities
will be organized with the Research Experience Training Coordination Core (RETCC) to inform project leaders
and trainees about optimal data management practices and procedures. Accomplishing these aims will foster
data science approaches by assuring MSU SRC data can be found, accessed, and independently interpreted
with the overall objective that data can be successfully used and reused in an interoperable manner. In summary,
DMAC will work closely with projects and cores to facilitate: curation and sharing of data sets and analyses;

10877999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reducing the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances is a complicated, long-term goal of the Superfund
Research Program that requires effective relationships among scientific, governmental, and community
stakeholders. The current proposal seeks funding to innovate on our previous general efforts to create, foster,
and improve these relationships through a specific focus on building trust by addressing vulnerability. We
propose to work closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and especially its Division
of Environmental Health (DEH), in a series of community engagements in Saginaw, St. Clair Shores, and Otsego.
All three communities are impacted by dioxins and dioxin-like compounds and are important foci of the DEH’s
health education interventions. These community engagements traditionally take an information dissemination
approach, seeking to provide community members with the information necessary to make informed prevention
decisions. We propose to leverage the substantive and methodological expertise of our Core and Center to
iteratively listen (SA1), empower (SA2), and evaluate (SA3) with a primary focus on using our engagement
efforts to optimally build trust. Despite their common environmental health challenges, all three communities vary
considerably in terms of their social context: They include a community facing significant environmental injustice
issues (Saginaw); an affluent community that is likely to have the resources to self-protect without the help of
the state (St. Clair Shores); and a politically conservative, rural community (Otsego). Addressing each
community’s unique concerns is critical to both effective engagement and trust building. To this end, our SA1
activities will collect community perspectives that will be interpreted with the help of a Local Advisory Group to
ensure that local knowledge and experience play a central role throughout the sense-making process. In SA2,
we will collaboratively engage these communities through a series of health education interventions. We will
leverage our Core’s expertise to improve these engagements by integrating community perspectives and
develop strategies to explicitly address the salient vulnerabilities identified in SA1. In SA3, we will conduct
rigorous evaluations of the immediate and cumulative impact of our engagements and adapt for the next year.
All of our activities will be conducted in close collaboration with our RTC and Project Leads to ensure the
integration of Center expertise, but we will also create opportunities for our Center investigators to learn from
these communities and from the DEH. To ensure the impact of these experiences on our Center, we will engage
in capacity-building activities to better position investigators and trainees in our MSU Center and across the
Superfund Research Program to build trust with the individuals and groups impacted by their work."

physical sciences/engineering and mathematics together. The MSU SRC is a paragon of this movement, as
evidenced by the collaborations leading to joint publications by the toxicologists, engineers and mathematical
modelers involved in the Project. Interdisciplinary research is accomplished by promoting nine Specific Aims: (1)
Monthly Virtual Laboratory meetings where the Michigan State, Emory, Purdue and Rutgers researchers link by
video conferencing, with emphasis placed on presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows; (2)
a four-session interactive Seminar Series providing a conceptual and motivational framework for trainees to
appreciate the value of embracing multi-method, interdisciplinary research involving teams of diverse individuals;
(3) Diverse trainee recruitment and retention; (4) providing interdisciplinary training to students through (i) formal
instruction (a Computational Biology course, and a Physiologically-based Toxicokinetics course– both presented
as intensive three and five day hands-on short courses), (ii) a seminar series organized by the graduate
student/postdoctoral fellows who invite the speakers, and (iii) support travel to provide special educational
opportunities, visit a lab to learn a new technique; (5) a Systems Biology/Genomics Journal Club; (6) a one
semester course meeting 1 hour/week, focused on the social dimensions and communication of environmental

about the Center’s activities and trainees to the SRP on a quarterly basis; and (9) to institute procedures for
compliance with the requirement that all graduate students and post docs enter their relevant information in NIH’s

10882239,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively common genetic disorder, which features hamartoma
or tumor growth in multiple organs, including the brain, and causes a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric
symptoms, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. Mutation of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes leads to
hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which drives tumor growth and
epileptogenesis in TSC. Epilepsy occurs in up to 90% of TSC patients and is intractable to treatment in the
majority of cases, often leading to life-long disabling seizures. While significant advances in treatment of epilepsy
in TSC have been made, including recent FDA approval of an mTOR inhibitor for epilepsy, most TSC patients
continue to have intractable seizures and significant side effects, which strongly affect quality of life and may
exacerbate co-morbidities of cognitive and behavioral disorders. So, novel therapeutic approaches to epilepsy
in TSC are greatly needed.
 An intriguing, unexplored avenue to investigate epilepsy in TSC relates to the regulation of intracellular
chloride homeostasis, which is critical for facilitating synaptic inhibition in the brain, particularly as driven by
gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors. The K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2) extrudes chloride from
neurons, leading to a relatively low intracellular concentration and negative reversal potential for chloride. Thus,
activation of GABAA receptors results in a hyperpolarizing chloride influx and synaptic inhibition of neurons in
the normal mature brain. However, during early brain development or under certain pathological conditions,
KCC2 expression may be relatively low, leading to elevated intracellular chloride concentrations and a
depolarizing response to GABA, increasing neuronal excitability and the propensity for seizures. Reduced KCC2
expression in pathological brain specimens from TSC patients with epilepsy have been reported, but the
functional consequences of this abnormality and its potential role in causing epilepsy in TSC have not been
previously investigated. In this grant, we test the novel hypothesis that decreased KCC2 expression may cause
or contribute to epilepsy in mouse models of TSC and that pharmacological modulators that increase KCC2
expression may be effective treatments for seizures in TSC. This work is innovative in investigating a novel
mechanism of epileptogenesis in the genetic epilepsy of TSC. The findings from these studies may have strong
clinical significance and impact for developing novel therapies for epilepsy in TSC. In particular, some KCC2
modulators are already FDA-approved for other indications and could be repurposed and tested in clinical trials
for epilepsy in TSC patients, potentially making the path to clinical translation and applications of this grant
relatively immediate. In addition, as TSC is often viewed as a model disease, findings from this proposal may
have relevance for the potential role of KCC2 in other epilepsies due to other causes."
10881029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The contribution of oxidative mitochondrial (mt) damage to inflammatory lung diseases is undisputed, but
mechanisms underlying this association remain to be elucidated. Emerging evidence, however, points to the
mitochondrial (mt) genome as a signaling hub integrating the initiation and resolution inflammatory responses.
For example, one of the earliest events is reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress-induced oxidative mtDNA
damage. Oxidized fragments of the mitochondrial genome (ox-mtDNA DAMPs) are then released into the
cytosol where they stimulate the recognition receptor (PRR) NLRP3 to activate caspase-1 which triggers
generation of proinflammatory cytokines. The mitochondrial base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway is
important to this process since increasing or decreasing BER capacity suppressed or accentuated,
respectively, mtDNA damage and ox-mDNA DAMP mobilization. BER also may be important in resolution of
the inflammatory response. Full recovery requires restoration of mitochondrial function, accomplished in part
by mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial DNA replication is a prerequisite for biogenesis, but replication
must not take place until the mutagenic base damage initiating inflammation is repaired. Thus, BER and
mtDNA replication must be faithfully coupled; if not, the resulting somatic mtDNA mutations would cripple
recovery, potentially leading to acute and post-acute complications. Despite these advances, events
underlying the transition between inflammation and its resolution are unclear. We now propose to test the
hypothesis that a signaling axis involving mtDNA repair and caspase-1 integrates processes essential
for initiation and resolution of NLRP3-dependent inflammation. Studies in cultured cells and intact
rodents will: (1) Determine how BER coordinates initiation and resolution of ox-mtDNA DAMP formation with
the intensity of inflammatory stress; and (2) Test the hypothesis that caspase-1 differentially regulates mtDNA
repair and replication to ensure that NLRP3-induced inflammation is appropriate for the severity of the
initiating stimulus while ensuring error-free, recovery-related mtDNA replication. This work is significant
because it will test a new hypothesis to explain how the inflammatory response initiated by NLRP3 is titrated
to the severity of the initiating stimulus and resolved without complications, including the potential introduction
of somatic variants into mitochondrial genome during resolution of inflammation. These studies are also
technically innovative; they will apply new mtDNA sequencing and isotopic labeling strategies to track the
formation and fate of proinflammatory ox-mtDNA as it relates to lung cell inflammation and resolution."
10882369,"Project Summary/Abstract. The goal of this project is to better understand activation of transcription initiation
by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNApII), a process that is often abnormal in cancer cells. Our system
combines Colocalization Single-Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS, a TIRF microscopy technique for
simultaneously analyzing hundreds of single-molecule events) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear extracts
from strains with one or more transcription coactivators engineered for fluorescence labeling. Combining these
extracts with a transcription activator (that may be labeled with yet another color), we image binding of up to
three factors to DNA templates immobilized on the microscope slide. CoSMoS thus allows precise
measurements of interaction dynamics between promoter DNA, activators, co-activators, and the RNApII
transcription machinery. Specific Aim 1 extends our work on Mediator from the previous period. Having
established the temporal relationships between activator, RNApII, and the co-activator Mediator, we will
determine how the Tail and Kinase modules affect the process. We will further test our model that Mediator,
RNApII, and a subset of basal factors form a “pre-PIC” while bound to activators, poised for transfer of this
activation intermediate to the core promoter. Specific Aim 2 analyzes how activators “recruit” the coactivators
SAGA, Swi/Snf, and NuA4. These three factors act upon nucleosomes, so our experiments compare naked
versus chromatinized templates, immobilized side-by-side on the same microscope slide. Experiments labeling
different combinations of coactivators will reveal if their binding is independent, sequential, simultaneous, or
mutually exclusive. Finally, Specific Aim 3 looks at how the characteristics of the activators themselves
influence coactivator interactions. As a model system, we compare different activation domains (VP16, Gcn4,
Rap1, et al.) fused to the same Gal4 DNA binding domain. We are also studying the natural yeast activator
Gcn4. Using matched promoters having single versus multiple Gal4 binding sites, we are uncovering direct
evidence for transcription synergy and mechanisms of cooperativity. Interestingly, there are measurable
differences in dynamics produced by different activation domains and different coactivators. These
experiments will reveal whether transcriptional synergy reflects increased binding frequencies, durations,
and/or co-occupancy of coactivators and Mediator/RNApII. Together, these single molecule experiments will
reveal fundamental information about transcription activation that has been impossible to glean from ensemble
biochemical or genomic techniques. The yeast system is well established as an excellent model system for all
eukaryotes, and findings here will provide deeper understanding of the mammalian homologs that are very
frequently mutated in cancer."
10882692,"Multiple biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes are at least partially governed by circadian
rhythms. We have shown that global deficiencies in Clock and Bmal1 increase atherosclerosis. In the past few
years, two studies have published conflicting reports regarding the role of myeloid/macrophage (Mφ) Bmal1 in
atherosclerosis. Therefore, we performed in-depth analyses and observed that Mφ-specific Bmal1 deficiency
increases atherosclerosis in five different mouse models. Our mechanistic studies revealed that Mφ Bmal1
regulates three pathways in cholesterol metabolism. First, Bmal1 regulates uptake of modified lipoproteins by
regulating Cd36 expression. Second, Bmal1 deficiency decreases cholesterol efflux by reducing the expression
of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (Abcg1). Furthermore, Bmal1 partners with Npas2 to coordinately
regulate Abcg1 via the Zinc finger protein 202 (Znf202) repressor. Third, Bmal1 deficiency impairs cholesterol
egress from lysosomes due to dysregulation of NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (Npc1) and Npc2 in
Bmal1 deficient Mφs. Based on these findings, we propose three aims to delineate comprehensively the role of
Bmal1 in Mφ cholesterol metabolism.
Aim 1: Circadian regulation of modified lipoprotein uptake. At the molecular level, we will test the hypothesis
that Bmal1 regulates Cd36 by regulating Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (Rev-erbα). For
physiologic context, we will extend these studies to Mφ-specific Rev-erbα deficient mice.
Aim 2: Molecular mechanisms controlling cholesterol efflux. We will test the hypothesis that Bmal1
deficiency increases Znf202 expression and that Bmal1:Npas2 heterodimers regulate Znf202. Higher Znf202
levels repress Abcg1 expression through binding to the GnT-box.
Aim 3: Regulation of lysosomal cholesterol egress. We will test the hypothesis that Bmal1 interacts with the
E-boxes in the promoters of Npc1 and Npc2 to regulate their circadian expression and lysosomal cholesterol
egress.
These studies are expected to elucidate key biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulated by Bmal1 that
control modified lipoprotein uptake, cholesterol efflux from Mφs and cholesterol egress from lysosomes, thus
providing comprehensive information regarding Mφ cholesterol homeostasis. These studies should additionally
demonstrate that cholesterol metabolism and circadian regulatory mechanisms are intertwined, and that the
deregulation of circadian pathways alters Mφ cholesterol homeostasis, thereby enhancing the risk of
atherosclerosis. The proposed studies are expected to substantially advance fundamental knowledge in two
fields of biology—chronobiology and cholesterol metabolism."

clinical health psychologist and a leader in live video mind-body intervention development; co-mentor, Dr. Christine
Ritchie, a geriatrician and palliative care physician with decades of research on improving the detection and treatment of
ADRD; advisor, Dr. Stephen Bartels, a geriatric psychiatrist and national expert in implementation science; advisor, Dr.
Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist internationally renowned for app-based mindfulness programs for
behavior change; advisor, Dr. Olivia Okereke, a geriatric psychiatrist specializing in modifiable lifestyle risk factors of
ADRD; and advisor, Dr. Bettina Hoeppner, an experimental psychologist with expertise in statistics and longitudinal
modeling of mobile health data. This proposal logically builds on my prior work co-developing My Healthy Brain (MHB)
– the first mindfulness-based lifestyle program to modify ADRD risk factors in older adults with subjective cognitive
decline (SCD). SCD is a critical window for ADRD prevention, while cognitive symptoms are at the earliest stage, yet
prior trials targeting multiple lifestyle factors have shown limited adherence, are time-intensive, and failed to produce
behavior change. In contrast, MHB 1) teaches mindfulness skills to improve lifestyles; 2) uses mobile health technologies
(ActiGraph watches, smartphone app) to assess and reinforce behaviors; and 3) is delivered via live video. For Aim 1, I
will conduct live video focus groups with medical stakeholders (N = 20) using elements from Proctor’s implementation
framework to
address barriers to efficient referrals, develop participant engagement strategies, and optimize study
procedures. For Aim 2, I will establish — via a live video pilot RCT in older adults (age ≥ 60) with SCD and ADRD risk
factors — the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and fidelity of the MHB versus an education control (N=50)
following predetermined benchmarks. The findings will inform an efficacy trial (R01) that will also test mechanisms of
improvements in lifestyle and cognition. This K23 aligns with the NIA funding priority of developing feasible and
personalized strategies for promoting adherence to lifestyles that are protective of ADRD. The experiences gained during
the award will facilitate my independence as a leading clinician scientist focused on healthy aging and ADRD prevention."

Hispanic adolescents are disproportionately burdened by type 2 diabetes (T2D) and social determinants of health
(SDoH), which can serve as barriers to behavior change and participation in disease prevention efforts.
Telehealth is a potentially effective approach for delivering disease prevention programs in vulnerable
communities as it reduces the burden of some SDoH like transportation, childcare needs, and parent work
schedules. However, there are no theory- or evidence-based telehealth T2D prevention programs for Hispanic
youth. The goal of this career development award is to assist Dr. Erica Soltero in her long-term goal of becoming
an independent investigator designing and implementing T2D prevention interventions among high-risk pediatric
populations impacted by SDoH. Dr. Soltero’s short-term goals include gaining expertise in the use of mixed-
methods, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and development of technology-based interventions. In
collaboration with her multidisciplinary mentorship team, she has developed a training plan to reach these goals
via coursework, workshops, scientific meetings, and mentored research. The purpose of this study is to adapt
Everly Little Step Counts (ELSC), an evidence-based, culturally grounded T2D prevention program, for delivery
via telehealth and test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted telehealth intervention. While telehealth is
more suited for remotely delivering nutrition education, other technology-based tools are needed to remotely
promote physical activity (PA). Thus, we will adapt and integrate our previously tested intervention that uses
activity trackers (i.e. Fitbit) and text-messages grounded in the SDT to promote PA into the telehealth program.
To ensure that all technology-based components are feasible and considerate of SDoH, we will use a mixed-
methods approach across three iterative phases to engage Hispanic adolescents (14-16 years; N=24) and their
parents (N=24) in the adaptation process. Once the ELSC-telehealth program is developed, a new sample of
Hispanic adolescents (14-16 years; N=40) with obesity (BMI%≥95th) will be recruited from community clinics
and randomized to the 12-week ELSC-telehealth intervention or usual care control group. Feasibility and
acceptability will be assessed using a priori feasibility criteria (e.g. recruitment, data collection, fidelity) and exit
interviews. We will examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on PA and T2D risk outcomes (fasting
glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and HbA1c). This proposal builds on the investigative team’s previous work
in T2D prevention, activity trackers, and text messaging to develop a telehealth delivered T2D prevention
program with great potential for reaching and engaging Hispanic youth. This study will advance the science on
telehealth as a disease-prevention tool among high-risk youth impacted by SDoH. Completion of the proposed
training and research will provide Dr. Soltero with the skills, research experience, professional development, and
scholarly products needed to apply for R01 funding and transition to a successful, independent scientist."

10885156,"Abstract
Yoga, a physical activity based mind-body therapy has become increasingly popular as a preventive and
therapeutic practice, making it one of the therapies with the most rapid increase in prevalence. Practice of yoga
combines physical activity, modulated breathing and meditative exercises that combine to provide the
practitioner a holistic mind-body experience. The effectiveness of yoga has been examined for a number of
health outcomes, including stress, anxiety, depression, management of chronic conditions such as lower back
pain and type 2 diabetes. Fewer studies have examined the effects of yoga practice on brain health and
cognitive function. Age related cognitive decline is well documented. With the increasing population of older
adults in the US, there is a need to not only test popular forms of exercise such as yoga, but also compare
their efficacy with modalities such as aerobic exercise that have proven neurocognitive benefits. This research
is timely in that yoga is a gentle and modifiable form of exercise that can be easily adapted for practice by older
adults who may exhibit comorbidities or chronic health conditions that keep them from walking or performing
other forms of aerobic exercise. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized control trial examining
and comparing the effects of yoga and aerobic exercise training on behavioral and neurobiological
correlates of cognitive function.
We propose to conduct a 6-month randomized controlled exercise trial among older adults to compare the
efficacy of yoga with aerobic exercise on cognitive function, brain structure and function, cardiorespiratory
fitness, functional fitness, and inflammatory and molecular markers. Using a single-blind, three arm
randomized control trail, 168 older adults ages 55-79 will be assigned to either: a Hatha yoga group, an
aerobic exercise group or an active stretching and strengthening control group. The groups will engage in
hour-long group exercise sessions 3x/week. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery, brain imaging,
cardiovascular fitness test, and a blood draw will take place at baseline; end of the 6-month intervention, and at
12-month follow-up.
The proposed pilot RCT will examine the relationship between yoga training and improved cognitive
functioning as well as identify neurobiological correlates as potential mechanisms of action through
which yoga training exerts its effect on cognitive function.
The investigative team is interdisciplinary, highly productive and has a history of collaboration in conducting
exercise interventions examining neurocognitive outcomes in older adults."
10885164,"HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that
has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the
incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and
biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C-
IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in
people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data
showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum
cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of
patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory
homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial
carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between
natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with
deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims
are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate
monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To
determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability
and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets,
VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls,
and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform
tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into
the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines."
10885165,"Neuropathology of the microtubule-associated protein tau is central to numerous devastating neurological
disorders termed tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau promotes microtubule (MT)
polymerization and stability via its interaction with tubulin, regulated by phosphorylation to tau in multiple
domains. Six major tau isoforms are alternatively spliced in an age-dependent manner. While FTDP-17-causing
mutations in tau show isoform-dependent effects on aggregation and microtubule stabilization, there are no tau
mutations linked to AD. Meanwhile, isoform-dependent effects of phosphorylation to tau remain unexplored.
Interestingly, I discovered that numerous AD-relevant phospho-tau (pTau) sites are also phosphorylated during
normal embryonic development, and then decrease over age. Why are specific pTau sites, which are correlated
with disease, also expressed during normal development? The parallel between the developmental and
pathological states suggests that understanding the function of pTau during development would elucidate the
mechanism(s) underlying tau pathology in AD. My preliminary data indicate that i) numerous AD-relevant pTau
sites are expressed in normal embryonic mouse brains, ii) pTau is soluble and likely functional in fetal tissue, iii)
phosphorylation at sites T231, S235 and S262 impair MT polymerization by the fetal tau isoform but not an adult
isoform, and iv) these same pTau sites accelerate aggregation of the adult isoform over the fetal isoform. Recent
evidence demonstrates that tau initiates nucleation of MT polymerization. Based on my preliminary data, !
propose that tau phosphorylation has isoform-dependent effects, in which specific pTau sites are detrimental to
adult isoforms in an aging brain but functional in the fetal isoform in developing brains. I will explore two aims
which will provide critical insight to understanding the effects of tau phosphorylation in each isoform. In Aim 1, I
will determine the relationship between the interaction between pTau with both soluble tubulin and stabilized
MTs in each isoform. In Aim 2, I will test for the relationship between pTau sites which cause tau to dissociate
from MTs with those that accelerate its aggregation and/or seeding activity. Importantly, our lab has uniquely
synthesized full-length tau with genuine chemical phosphorylation at sites T231, S235 and S262 for these
studies. These experiments will be tested using multiple platforms including these chemically-synthesized
proteins, high-resolution single-molecule techniques (single-molecule FRET, fluorescence correlative
spectroscopy, and time-lapse TIRF microscopy), and injection of semi-synthesized proteins into mouse brains.
The investigator has 6+ years of expertise in working with the biological assays and mouse models described
here, and the sponsor and collaborators will guide training in the described chemical and biophysical techniques.
I anticipate that my findings will elucidate the function of tau in developing neurons, and will provide insight into
mechanisms of pathological tau hyperphosphorylation across numerous tauopathies including AD."
10885174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Close to 40% of home health patients have been identified as persons with Alzheimer’s Disease or Related
Dementias (ADRD). As the prevalence of ADRD in the population in general is expected to double by 2050, so
will the percent of patients with ADRD treated by home health agencies.
During the Covid-19 pandemic many home health agencies have begun using telehealth technologies,
including virtual visits and biomonitoring, to augment and partially substitute in-person, traditional care. This is
an acceleration of a trend that began over a decade earlier. A survey has found that by July of 2020, 49% of
agencies used some form of telehealth.
These two emerging trends, the expected increase in patients with ADRD on the one hand and the increased
penetration and utilization of TH by HHAs on the other, raise questions about whether the two are compatible.
Can home health care provided via telehealth to patients with ADRD be as good as the care provided to these
patients in person? Would it be comparable in terms of patients’ health outcomes and patients’ experience?
These questions have not been addressed to-date.
Furthermore, there is no information about the type of agencies that adopted telehealth, and in particular
among those agencies that care for a majority of ADRD patients. There is also no information about the
differences in types of telehealth technologies (e.g. communication telehealth versus biomonitoring) that were
adopted.
This study will address these questions by: 1.) performing a national survey of home health agencies caring for
a majority of patients with ADRD about their telehealth capabilities and use, and the timing of telehealth
adoption; 2.) linking survey data to agency characteristics, patients’ health outcomes and patients’ experience
data; 3.) analyzing the data statistically to identify agency characteristics associated with different stages of
telehealth adoption, the association between telehealth and better patients’ health outcomes and experiences,
and the relative ranking of specific telehealth technologies in terms of their association with better patients’
health outcomes and better patients experiences.
The information gained in this study will inform home health patients and families, advocates, the industry and
CMS, as the issue of payment for telehealth services for home health is moving forward towards consideration
by Congress and will influence federal and state policies in the coming years."
10885176,"Metastatic disease, or the spread of cancer cells from invasive primary tumor to distal organs through vasculature
or lymphatics is responsible for majority of patient deaths and remains a clinical challenge. Not all invasive tumors
are metastatic, therefore defining the determinants of metastatic competence and identifying cancer patients
likely to develop metastasis or have residual disease is critical for clinical management of disease. Intratumor
heterogeneity, inability to precisely isolate tumor cells from the invasive front and limited access to clinical follow-
up data present a major challenge to identify metastatic competency determinants.
Invasive intravascular growth is observed in approximately 15% of ccRCC patients as tumor thrombus. This
invasive tumor extension can be accurately identified using cross sectional imaging including computerized
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans and is valuable for tumor staging. We investigated resected
invasive primary tumors with clearly defined extension into the vasculature to identify ccRCC invasion and
metastasis determinants. Approximately fifty percent of ccRCC patients with intravascular tumor extension
develop metastasis post nephrectomy and treatment and have poor survival outcome. Comprehensive
transcriptomic analysis of metastatic and non-metastatic invasive ccRCC tumors with intravascular extension
identified metastatic competence determinants.
Our central hypothesis is that metastatic competence of invasive ccRCC tumors is dependent on PRRX1 driven
vasculogenic mimicry and the ability of chemotactic cytokines to recruit CXCR2 positive infiltrating immune cells
to the invasive front that promote dissemination and colonization to distal organs. Pharmacologic and conditional
genetic manipulation of PRRX1 and CXCL1 ligands in experimental model systems resulted in attenuated
metastasis.
We will investigate the role of PRRX1 mediated vasculogenic mimicry in driving metastasis and assess the
impact of TGF-β inhibitor on metastatic progression. We will also elucidate the role of CXCL1 in driving
metastasis and assess the impact of CXCR2 antagonist on metastatic progression. We anticipate this project
will decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms determining metastatic competency of invasive ccRCC and develop
innovative therapies to disrupt metastatic competence, which in combination with current standard of care
regimens will result in effective management of metastatic disease."

Sleep characteristics change dramatically across development. In early life, sleep duration and depth are
elevated, and sleep lacks a strong circadian pattern. With maturation, sleep duration tapers to adult levels and
clear sleep rhythms emerge. The genes, molecules, and neural circuits governing developmental changes to
sleep are largely unknown. Sleep in early life is hypothesized to facilitate structural maturation of the brain, and
sleep abnormalities during development may contribute to aberrant neural circuit formation. Moreover, sleep
disorders are highly prevalent in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Improving sleep by targeting
regulatory pathways may thus represent a new therapeutic avenue in NDDs; however, the knowledge gap
regarding factors controlling early life sleep hinders design of sleep-related strategies. Our research uses the
powerful model system Drosophila to gain novel insights into sleep regulation and function across
developmental periods. Our studies have led to 1) identification of genes that specifically coordinate sleep
maturation, 2) functional insights into the role of sleep during early development, and 3) mechanisms coupling
sleep to NDDs. Building on these efforts, this research program is comprised of three highly integrated
domains that seek to define sleep regulatory mechanisms during development and understand how sleep
influences brain maturation in normal and pathological states. First, in studies spanning larval to adult stages,
we will determine sleep cellular and circuit properties across development. We propose to identify sleep/wake
regulatory neurons of interest in early development, characterize these cells, map connectivity, and
trace/characterize the cells in the adult. Second, we will examine mechanisms controlling emergence of
circadian sleep. Our recent work has pinpointed when sleep rhythms first emerge during Drosophila
development. We will determine mechanisms controlling onset of sleep rhythms, functional consequences of
circadian sleep, and how development of clock-sleep circuits ties into broader sleep regulatory mechanisms.
Third, we propose to utilize genetic screens to investigate molecular/cellular coupling of sleep and NDDs.
Specifically, we will pursue a comprehensive assessment of how NDD-associated gene manipulations affect
sleep across numerous developmental stages, each of which has unique behavioral and molecular features
that might be specifically sensitive to particular perturbations. Genetic findings will be placed into context of
sleep/circadian circuit principles in an ongoing, integrated manner. Collectively, our research program will
generate new insights into the regulation of early life sleep, deepening our understanding of the link between
sleep, brain development, and neurodevelopmental pathology."
10887232,"Project Summary/Abstract
Touch-evoked pain is a hallmark of persistent pain, making it crucial to understand how supraspinal touch
pathways contribute to the different aspects of pain. The dorsal column nuclei (DCN) in the brainstem receives
direct input from touch sensory neurons. Various non-specific manipulations such as ablation, electrical
stimulation, and pharmacology, have implicated the DCN in both transmitting and reducing touch-evoked pain.
While these manipulations highlight 2 opposing roles for the DCN, as a mediator or inhibitor of touch-evoked
pain, the mechanisms underlying these opposing roles remain unknown. The functional relevance of touch
processing by the DCN is defined by its output connectivity with effector structures throughout the brain. Two
important regulators of pain behavior, the ventral posterolateral thalamus (VPL) and ventrolateral periaqueductal
gray (vlPAG), receive input from the DCN. The VPL plays an important role in touch and pain perception, while
the vlPAG is part of a descending pain suppression circuit. My central hypothesis is that the dorsal column nuclei
(DCN) shape our central representation of touch through two functionally distinct pathways to the thalamus and
the periaqueductal gray. Disruption of the balance between these pathways following injury allows touch stimuli
to engage ‘pain’ pathways and promote touch-evoked pain. To test this hypothesis, I will employ a powerful
combination of tools to determine the mechanisms underlying altered touch signaling following neuropathic injury
and simultaneously image Ca2+ activity and optogenetically manipulate distinct neural populations to determine
how divergent projections to the VPL and vlPAG uniquely contribute to the sensory, affective, and motivations
components of pain behavior. During the mentored K99 phase, my career development and training will be
supervised by my mentors Drs. Abraria (Rutgers), Aston-Jones (Rutgers), and Stuber (University of
Washington). I will also receive additional support from Drs. Basbaum (UCSF), Abdus-Saboor (Columbia), Tao
(Rutgers), Margolis (Rutgers), and Azim (Salk). These mentors possess expertise in viral and optogenetic circuit
mapping, in-vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice, machine-vision behavioral approaches to define how
neural networks encode different aspects of behavior in health and disease. During the independent R00 phase,
I will examine the postsynaptic targets of DCN projections within the VPL and vlPAG, studying how neural
ensembles in these regions encode the many facets of persistent pain behavior. Completing the proposed aims
will provide fundamental insight into how the DCN encodes tactile information and elucidate the circuits that
promote touch-evoked pain in persistent pain states. This career development award will provide conceptual and
technical training, as well as mentorship from renowned experts in the field of circuit neuroscience. The training
opportunities provided by the K99/R00 will prepare me to lead an independent research program and serve as
a foundation for future NIH grant applications focused on the supraspinal circuits that encode touch-evoked pain."
10888372,"Abstract. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is presently an untreatable neurodegenerative disorder with a massive
public health burden. With invention of biomarker technologies for imaging β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles in the living human brain, it became clear that these pathologies that define AD begin
decades prior to overt dementia symptoms resulting from this disease. This prolonged pre-dementia period
offers opportunities for early interventions. However, much is currently unknown about the complex AD
pathophysiology in these early stages. One intriguing observation is that the early Aβ pathology is often
localized to highly metabolic regions of the brain. These regions, also known as ‘cortical hubs’ due to their high
functional interconnectivity with other brain areas, may display activity related susceptibility. Animal models
show that, in functionally active brain regions, disrupted rapid temporal structure of intrinsic neural activity and
neurovascular dysregulation can influence Aβ homeostasis. It is possible that these pathophysiological
mechanisms hold true in the aging human brain. However, precise measurement of rapid neural activity and
neurovascular regulation in the higher-order brain areas most vulnerable to AD has been challenging.
Currently available imaging techniques, when used alone, have severe limitations. The signal measured by
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reflects coupling between metabolic demand of active brain
cells and a nutritive increase in cerebral blood flow and cannot differentiate between dysfunctions in neural
activity itself and this neurovascular coupling (NVC). Techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG),
cannot unambiguously localize the recorded neurophysiological signal to specific neural networks. To
overcome this critical barrier, we developed a cutting-edge scanning and analysis paradigm that [1]
simultaneously records EEG and fMRI data, [2] detects and quantifies short timescale structure of transient
events of intrinsic neurophysiological activity in cortical networks, and [3] uses these neural network events to
anchor assessment of capacity to adjust vascular energy delivery in response to activity demands. Such
selective measurements in unique neural networks will be used in the current project to test if disrupted rapid
neural function and NVC in the active ‘cortical hubs’ are associated and show temporal precedence to Aβ
pathology and the linked deficits in higher-order cognitive domains in a longitudinal cohort of older adults
without clinical dementia. We will quantify Aβ pathology by leveraging novel ultra-sensitive blood biomarkers.
Successful implementation of this approach would suggest that, in the aging human brain, abnormal fast
neural dynamics and NVC in specific cortical regions are disease states predisposing to Aβ pathological
changes. If such disease states are an upstream process to Aβ pathology, then in future studies, it may be
possible to regulate Aβ homeostasis through pharmacological or brain stimulation approaches that target fast
neural dynamics and NVC, and consequently, prevent progressive pathology and cognitive decline."

Abstract
 Our goal is to fabricate and validate a novel immunosensor which attaches to implanted medical devices to
detect and monitor local infection biomarker concentrations using standard-of-care X-ray imaging. While
implanted medical devices improve patient quality of life and extend life expectancy, they both reduce the
number of bacteria needed to cause an infection and provide a haven for growth biofilms that tolerate both
antibiotics and host immune system. Thus, over half of the 2 million hospital-acquired infections in the US
are associated with implanted medical devices, with 90,000 annual attributed deaths and staggering
costs. Early detection is key to treatment as it allows interventions before tissue damage or progression to
systemic infection and sepsis. Likewise, during treatment it is important to monitor infections for eradication to
ensure success of device replacements. However, systemic blood biomarkers are ineffective at early stages or
during antibiotic treatment when the infection is localized near the device. Fluid aspiration is performed when
needed, but not appropriate for screening or repeated monitoring as it is invasive, painful, can cause
inflammation, and for areas such as hip is performed by a radiologist under fluoroscopy. By contrast, our
device will be attached during implantation or surgical irrigation & debridement and noninvasively read with X-
rays which are already acquired as the standard of care during followup and emergency visits. Previously, we
demonstrated proof-of-concept for X-ray readout of radiodense dials for mechanical strain in cadaveric and
sheep models, and pH measurements in cadaveric and a rat peritonitis models. Here, we will extend the
concept for the first time to an antigen-responsive immunosensor, and specifically to detecting alpha-
defensin an infection-specific biomarker released by activated neutrophils. To do this we will have to
control the synthesis conditions, optimize device shape for sensitive readout at the clinical alpha-defensin
threshold, and add mechanical gain mechanisms to the gauge. We will also study sensor stability over 1 month
and more. We will develop a prototype and fasteners that attach it to a hip prosthesis and peritoneal dialysis
tube. We will characterize the hip-attached sensor in human cadaver models and the peritoneal dialysis tube-
attached sensor in a live rat model. The proposed research is significant because it develops a noninvasive
method to detect, monitor, and study infection biomarkers in situ with the ultimate potential for reducing
morbidity, mortality and associated cost from implant infections. Additionally, the approach can be generalized
to a wide range of other antigens on implanted devices or injected sensors which would broaden what we can
detect with X-rays and enable new tools for biomedical research and clinical practice.

Climate change impacts are accelerating throughout the world. In the western US and Alaska, we are seeing
significant increases in the frequency of wildfires, with smoke impacting our rural communities nearly every
summer and fall. Children growing up these rural and medically underserved communities face unique

interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. There is also a lack of
educational opportunities related to the field of public health in our rural states, which are desperately needed
as we address the emerging climate change crisis. Leveraging an existing network of 26 high schools located
throughout rural areas of Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, we will add an additional 20 middle schools as we
provide research opportunities for students to explore the topics of climate change, wildfires, and public health.
With an evaluation plan consisting of a mixed method design, we will test the overall hypothesis that our

10888231,"Abstract
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), is one of the most prevalent neuromuscular genetic
disorders, and it is caused by a loss of epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeats at chromosome 4 that then
leads to loss of silencing of DUX4. One of the most mysterious aspects of FSHD is the timing and the extent of
the DUX4 expression. Levels of DUX4 in the affected muscles are either extremely low and/or transient as
attempts to date have failed to detect the protein in situ. Evidence of DUX4 expression is indirect, based on
elevated DUX4 target genes in MRI-guided biopsies from FSHD patients. We developed an FSHD mouse model
(iDUX4pA;HSA) that allows conditional expression of DUX4 in muscle fibers, and which upon low level long-term
expression shows hallmarks of FSHD disease pathology. Because it is inducible and reversible, the
iDUX4pA;HSA mouse model provides a unique opportunity for exploring the hypothesis that DUX4 is only
required to prime muscle for later pathology. Our initial experiments indicate that transient DUX4 expression is
sufficient to induce long-term abnormalities in muscle tissue including an increased frequency of FAPs, an
excess of the fibrotic extracellular matrix, and the inability of the muscle to completely recover after injury. The
research proposed in this application aims to explore the long-lasting effect of transient DUX4 expression on
muscle physiology and histology, cellular alterations, and epigenetic state of the genome in the muscle of FSHD
mouse models. They will test the hypothesis that the echo of DUX4 expression, independent of DUX4 expression
itself, can contribute to muscle pathology."

10886069,"ABSTRACT: Data Analysis Core
In our investigation of the cellular architecture of bowel tissue, we will continue to generate
multimodal single-cell resolution data. Using the Chromium Multiome platform, we generate
simultaneous single-nuclei RNA+ATAC-seq to profile the gene transcription and regulatory
programs of cells. We have defined previously-described cell populations as well as novel cell
types and sub-types. Our spatial data will be mapped through two highly multiplexed assays:
the CODEX immunoassay and the Molecular Cartography FISH assay. Because CODEX
throughput can be scaled, we will use it to map serial sections that will be reconstructed to make
three-dimensional maps. Molecular Cartography will provide a complementary transcriptome
map to enable more accurate integration of the single-nuclei data to the CODEX maps. We
have existing standardized pipelines to process each of these data types. We also have tools to
integrate these multi-modal data types. We will continue to refine these integrative methods as
we investigate our proposed organ of focus along with other organs in coordination with
HuBMAP. All of our data will be submitted to the HIVE and public repositories for broad access
to the community."
10884952,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dementia caregivers, clinicians, and researchers can experience deep ethical conflicts when people
with dementia express strong preferences about personal care, finances, clinical management or
research participation that depart from values that they had previously espoused. As values are central
to relationships, such changes can also be destabilizing to caregivers’ own senses of self and
relationships with care recipients. The overall aim of this application is to leverage rich existing
interdisciplinary collaborations including expertise in clinical neurology, philosophy, social science and
psychology to address the unique problems posed by dementia’s progressive effects on fundamental
aspects of personality and judgment. Utilizing key conceptual links between valuing and self-reflection,
the proposed work is organized around three specific aims: 1) Examine self-narratives about values and
change among people with different dementia syndromes; 2) Assess how care recipients’ changing
values and self-narratives impact caregivers and caregiving relationships; and 3) Study longitudinal
change in values of people with dementia and in caregiver responses. Under the first aim, in-depth
qualitative interviews will be conducted with people who have early Alzheimer’s disease and
frontotemporal dementia, inviting them to reflect on their core values and whether they have been
changed in illness; responses will be analyzed alongside neuropsychological data from these
participants to aid in interpretation. For the second aim, caregivers will be interviewed about
experiences in caregiving in the context of changed values or changed expressions of values in people
with dementia; responses will be linked to an established measure of caregiver burden. In the third aim,
dynamic changes in values will be elicited in longitudinal interviews at 1.5- and 3-years’ follow-up, as
the passage of time may allow for healthy adaptation but also dementia progression necessitating
further changes in perceptions of values and relationships. Alongside these investigations, the proposal
includes plans for broad engagement with scholarly communities in multiple disciplines to advance
inquiry into valuing in dementia. The approach is innovative, advancing theoretical concepts in dementia
care and caregiving, and utilizing philosophical theory to inform new approaches to data collection,
analysis, and the linkage of social and neurobiological phenomena. The proposed research is significant
as it will advance both theory and evidence regarding common challenges in decision-making that are
uniquely problematic in dementia, which are implicated in recently-proposed legal and ethical reforms
to bioethical/legal constructs such as supported decision-making; and it will extend research on
caregiving challenges to more deeply personal aspects of caregivers’ relationships and identities."
10887951,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect that affects nearly 1 in 100
liveborn infants. Heterotaxy (HTX) is a severe form affecting 3-4% of CHD patients where left-
right (LR) asymmetry of internal organs is not established correctly. Epidemiological studies
suggest that genetics plays a significant role in CHD. Uncovering the genetic pathogenesis for
CHD is essential to provide a more accurate prognosis for CHD-related interventions, assess the
risk for neurodevelopmental delays, and counsel families about recurrence risks. However, infants
that undergo clinical genetic testing, known mutations and genes that cause CHD are identified
in <30% of cases. This issue is exacerbated in patients from racial or ethnic backgrounds that are
underrepresented in current genetic databases. The overarching GOAL of this proposal is to
address this barrier using a multidisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, bioinformaticians,
and basic scientists. Our research has the potential to significantly improve care and outcomes
for HTX patients."
10890698,"Project Summary
The overall objective of this proposal is to train graduate students and postdoctoral scientists
about the concept of implicit bias, the effects of bias on underrepresented minority students
in the biomedical, behavioral and clinical science (BBCS) fields, and the strategies to
mitigate the effects of bias on themselves, as well as in their current and future work
environments. This training both complements and extends the previously-funded project
titled, Breaking the Bias Cycle for Future Scientists: A Workshop to Learn, Experience, and Change
(NIH-NIGMS, R25GM114002, 2005-2020). It also leverages a number of other NIH-funded
projects to ensure that successful bias-reducing and mentoring models, trainings/workshops,
and strategies are applied in different venues and with additional populations (Carnes, 2015,
2017; Kaatz et al., 2017; Sorkness et al., 2017).
The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop training for graduate students and
postdoctoral scientists about implicit bias and its effects to empower them with bias-reducing
and resiliency-building strategies that positively influence their current and future work
environments; 2) Conduct the training through in-person workshops at universities, national
labs, and conferences, as well as through online webinars to deepen participant learning and to
provide ongoing support; and 3) Provide Fair Play Workshop Facilitator Training to expert
facilitators who have the foundational knowledge, skills, interest and commitment to further
disseminate and sustain this initiative. At the completion of the grant period, we expect to have:
1) an enhanced workshop conducted with ~2000 graduate students and postdocs to empower
them with bias-reducing and resiliency-building strategies, 2) complementary training offered
through webinars to enhance the learning of this subject post-workshop, and 3) approximately
200 trained facilitators who are able to offer workshops immediately after they are trained. The
investigators are ideally positioned to carry out the proposed work because they have
successfully collaborated on research, development and dissemination of Fair Play and its
accompanying materials on which this proposal is based."
10890709,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The developing mammary gland (MG) is vulnerable to environmental and lifestyle risk factors that increase
breast cancer (BC) burden in later adulthood. Therefore, optimizing BC prevention and care requires a lifespan
approach to identify specific early life risk factors, to understand these risk factors’ underlying molecular
mechanisms in promoting cancer risk, and to design appropriate interventions that reduce BC in adulthood.
Using a Sprague-Dawley rat model of human BC, we have established a dynamic and successful
transdisciplinary collaboration among a breast cancer biologist, an endocrinologist, and a biopsychologist to
understand how adverse early life exposures lead to increased mammary cancer risk in adulthood. We find
that glucocorticoid (GC) reactivity to everyday stressors is heighted by social isolation in puberty and young
adulthood and is associated with increased adult mammary cancer burden. Moreover, heightened GC
reactivity during puberty impairs ductal development and increases mammary stem cell populations, two
characteristics that have been linked to increased mammary cancer. We now propose to determine how
heightened GC reactivity disrupts MG development and increases cancer burden by examining the underlying
molecular mechanisms connecting glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation with MG developmental defects
(Aim 1). In Aim 2 we will introduce both pharmacological- and social environmental-interventions in early
adulthood to reverse heightened stress reactivity. We predict these interventions will restore normal MG ductal
differentiation and thereby decrease later cancer risk. In Aim 3, we will examine how heightened GC reactivity
during puberty inappropriately preserves mammary stem cell (MaSC) populations that are known to increase
later cancer risk. We will also investigate the association between circulating steroid hormone levels, in
conjunction with their localized production within the MG microenvironment, and ductal maturation and MaSC
biology. Completion of these studies will uncover novel stress-mediated molecular and cellular mechanisms of
disrupted MG development linked to subsequent mammary cancer and determine whether these stress-
mediated events are reversible with early adulthood interventions."
10890710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Methionine metabolism is a central regulator of protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, antioxidant
defense, and other critical cellular processes. Tightly regulating methionine flux via the methionine metabolism
pathway is essential for healthy cellular function. Not surprisingly, an imbalance in this fundamental metabolic
pathway has been attributed to numerous diseases. Yet, the molecular link between alterations in methionine
availability and dysregulation of downstream cellular processes remains obscure. Methionine and ATP are the
sole precursors for the production of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal and rate-
limiting methyl donor for methyltransferases (MTs), which catalyze a variety of methylation reactions via the
transfer of methyl groups onto different substrates. Although reprogramming of methionine metabolism has
been observed with different pathological conditions, it is not known which downstream MTs link methionine
metabolism to the development of these pathological conditions and what mediates the specificity of this
interaction, representing a significant knowledge gap. I hypothesize that the identification of specific MTs
will reveal novel mechanisms by which methionine metabolism regulates essential cellular processes. The
goal of our research is to mechanistically understand how alterations in methionine are transduced into
biological effects. To accomplish this goal, my laboratory will build and sustain three research projects.
Through a preliminary screen, we identified several MTs that promote resistance to starvation or oxidative
stress similar to manipulations of the methionine metabolism pathway. I will test several models to determine
which MTs function downstream to methionine metabolism and complete the screen of the remaining MTs
(Project 1). Secondly, I will test whether the tissue-specific expression of selected MTs help explain the
specificity of how global changes in methionine levels affect specific MTs using a novel tissue-specific
methionine degradation system that we recently developed (Project 2). Finally, we will use an open-ended
proteomics approach to identify prospective downstream targets of the identified MTs and test how these MTs
affect functional responses to stress (Project 3). These platforms interdigitate but also work independently,
noting that we have already identified several MTs that promote resistance to different stresses, so Projects 2
and 3 can be performed independently of Project 1. We will employ innovative approaches by combining
novel genetic tools that allow us to manipulate methionine levels within specific tissues and using a state-of-
the-art approach to quantify methionine fate in vivo. The proposed research is significant because it will
uncover how a central metabolic pathway (methionine) controls many basic cellular processes. This basic
research is likely to further identify “druggable” targets relevant to multiple human pathologies associated with
reprogrammed methionine metabolism including cancer, obesity, neurodegeneration, and aging."
10888647,"Project summary/Abstract
Hemiplegia is a very common pediatric developmental condition in the United States with roughly 4000 babies
diagnosed every year. Children with hemiplegia have impaired upper extremity (UE) function, presenting
significant challenges during self-care, play, and school work. Current guidelines for evidence-based
rehabilitation recommend intensive, repetitive, goal-directed practice of at least 30-40 hours to produce
meaningful improvements in UE function; however, in practice, children receive < 15 hours of physical and
occupational therapy per month due to issues associated with access to services, therapist availability, as well
as time-related and financial constraints of families. This critical service gap needs to be addressed by
designing child- and family-centric interventions that can be easily implemented by families and can help boost
the dosing of conventional therapy. We propose that a training program that uses modified, commercially-
available joystick-operated ride-on-toys will be enjoyable, feasible, acceptable, and easy-to-implement for
families, and will also be effective in serving as an adjunct to conventional therapy to improve UE motor
function in children with hemiplegia. Thirty children with hemiplegia between 3 and 8 years will be matched on
age, gender, ability level, and therapies received and then randomly assigned to either an experimental group
(will receive a home program involving ride-on-toy navigation training) or a control group (will receive a home
program involving activities modeled on conventional physical and occupational therapy). Children in both
groups will receive training co-delivered by researchers and caregivers for 6 weeks @ 4 sessions/week (2
sessions by researchers and 2 sessions by caregivers). Both groups will continue to receive treatment-as-
usual outside study settings. Primary outcome measures (assessed at pretest, posttest, and 1 month follow-
up) associated with project specific aims include: (a) feasibility and satisfaction-related metrics using child and
caregiver questionnaires and (b) objective and subjective measures of preliminary efficacy of the training
program using standardized motor tests, accelerometry, and movement kinematics. Our work is highly
innovative in merging the interdisciplinary fields of healthcare and biomedical engineering to develop child-
friendly therapeutic aids/toys and effective family-centric training programs to promote self-initiated UE use,
motor function, and participation in children with hemiplegia. Our findings have implications for the use of
intrinsically rewarding, age-appropriate, ride-on-toys by caregivers and clinicians to incentivize spontaneous
UE use and promote sensorimotor, problem solving, and motor planning skills in children with hemiplegia. By
expanding hours of therapy beyond clinic/school settings, involving caregivers as interventionists, and
increasing goal-oriented practice as part of children's play routines in their naturalistic environments, we aim to
improve UE function and independence, while reducing future complications of non-use/disuse in children with
hemiplegia."
10890755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alpha oscillations, 8-12Hz fluctuations in neural signals, are robust across species, covary with states of
attention, and are impacted in multiple disorder states, and in recent years have become a candidate biomarker
of attention system efficacy, particularly in disorders of attention such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). Yet, despite this broad acceptance of alpha oscillations as an attention read-out signal, significant
questions remain regarding the mechanisms and thus interpretation of alpha oscillations. The goal of our
research is to answer the central question of whether the neurocognitive mechanisms of alpha oscillations are
strictly attentional or whether they more closely reflect other mechanisms such as local processing dynamics or
system-wide tonic alertness.
To address this question, we will record EEG and fMRI concurrently in human participants, and employ causal
models, to identify functional connectivity (3T scanning) and laminar activation (7T scanning) of visual cortex
during alpha modulations across different task contexts. We aim to test (1) if alpha increases reflect cortical
suppression or tonic alertness, (2) if alpha decreases reflect cortical enhancement or local information
flow, and, (3) if alpha modulations reflect top-down signals or if they are a passive by-product of either
cortico-cortical or thalamo-cortical drivers. The results will directly impact interpretation of alpha oscillations as a
biomarker of attention-system efficacy in ADHD and related conditions, outlining a model that can be targeted in
treatment or monitoring of attention deficits in ADHD. By accounting for variability in existing findings, this work
will also differentiate between two theoretical frameworks of alpha oscillations and speak to recent debates on
whether alpha oscillations are a correlate or a product of top-down signals."
10893109,"An extracellular vesicle component as a candidate to control cryptococcosis.
SUMMARY
Fungal diseases are a major threat to immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcosis, caused by members of
the Cryptococcus genus, is responsible for nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide annually. Immunocompromised
individuals are the primary population that develop cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a 100% fatal condition if
left untreated. C. neoformans, the most common causative agent of cryptococcosis, has recently been
classified as a critical threat by the World Health Organization. Despite their devastating impact on human
health, fungal diseases have been consistently neglected, as demonstrated by the lack of available antifungal
vaccines and our limited antifungal armamentarium. The Rodrigues and Nosanchuk laboratories have
collaborated actively for over 15 years in the field of fungal infections and have extensively characterized
fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) in various models. EVs play crucial roles in fungal physiology and
pathogenesis. Recently, we discovered that the tripeptide isoleucine-proline-isoleucine (IPI), a small molecule
component of EVs, effectively controls cryptococcal infection in an invertebrate host. IPI acts as an inhibitor of
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which plays a role in fungal pathogenesis, as well as in host physiology, by
regulating insulin and glucose. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the participation of IPI and DPP4 in
fungal immunopathogenesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 will explore the protective mechanisms of IPI in
animal models of cryptococcosis. Aim 2 focuses on understanding the roles of fungal and host DPP4 in
disease progression, including their impact on glucose metabolism and the immune response. Aim 3 seeks to
determine the relevance of IPI and DPP4 in other fungal models. Successful completion of this project will
provide a comprehensive characterization of a novel candidate for combating cryptococcosis and perhaps
other diseases. Furthermore, we anticipate gaining insights into the connection between DPP4 and fungal
pathogenesis. This proposal aims to foster intercontinental collaboration and enhance the capabilities of
Fiocruz, the Brazilian institution leading this collaborative effort."
10894469,"Abstract:
Adult teleost fish and urodele amphibians can regenerate entire amputated appendages, whereas this ability is
restricted to the tip of the distal phalanx in humans and mice. Though modest in comparison to its zebrafish and
salamander counterparts, mouse digit tip (MDT) regeneration exhibits similar anatomic stages and proceeds
with intramembranous bone regrowth and mostly scarless healing, even in adults. By studying shared principles
from organisms with elevated regenerative potential and applying them to mammalian models, we can gain
valuable insight into strategies to augment human tissue repair and improve the care of limb loss patients. The
catalogue of defined molecular factors in tissue regeneration is expanding and it has become critical to determine
how genes involved in regenerative events are engaged upon injury. We previously identified a new class of
regulatory sequences we named tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) that contain sequence
information necessary for precise control of regeneration genes. We also reported that TREEs of zebrafish origin
can be engineered in viral gene therapy constructs to target expression of pro-regenerative factors to mammalian
injury sites and enhance tissue repair. In preliminary collaborative studies between the Poss and Brown groups,
we have identified a new set of candidate TREEs from chromatin samples of regenerating MDTs. We have also
performed comparative studies guided by single-cell transcriptome analysis of regenerating zebrafish fins and
complemented by molecular genetics in mice, to implicate a conserved family of transcription factors in control
of digit tip regeneration. Concurrently, we have identified TREEs of zebrafish origin and an effective adeno-
associated virus (AAV) capsid variant that can transduce limb tissue and enable selective expression of gene
cargoes at an injury site. Our preliminary studies thus unveil a pipeline of TREE control element identification,
novel candidate pro-regenerative factor identification, and application of gene therapy methodology. Here, we
propose to: 1) identify distal regulatory elements that control key programs in MDT regeneration; 2) define
transcriptional mechanisms by conserved factors; and 3) enhance MDT regeneration by spatiotemporal delivery
of pro-regenerative factors. This work will increase understanding of transcriptional regulation during mammalian
digit tip regeneration and provide important perspective for comprehending, and perhaps changing, existing
limitations in the regenerative capacity of human limbs."
10894518,"Abstract. SHIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) develop HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) via
Env-Ab coevolutionary pathways that recapitulate events in HIV-1 infected humans (Science 371:eabd2638,
2021). We hypothesize that SHIV-infected RMs can thus serve as a novel “molecular guide” for HIV-1
immunogen design, allowing for an iterative and reproducible analysis of the critical steps in bNAb elicitation,
including efficient priming of naïve B cell precursors, immunofocused boosting, and affinity-maturation leading
to breadth and potency. In this application submitted in response to PAR-23-169 (Innovation for HIV Vaccine
Discovery), we propose to design novel germline-targeting SHIVs and to use them to decipher each of these
steps in SHIV-infected monkeys where, unlike in humans, we can analyze multiple animals infected by the same
SHIVs and identify Env-Ab co-evolutionary pathways that are shared among different animals. Based on these
findings, we will design and test novel prime and boost protein immunogens corresponding to key Env
“immunotypes” responsible for elicitation of bNAbs in the SHIV-infected monkeys. Our proposal focuses on
immunogen design for one of the most advanced HIV-1 vaccine targets (fusion peptide, FP) but one where
boosting regimens that lead to high level breadth and potency have been challenging to develop. Our immunogen
platforms include BG505, CH1012 and Ce1176 transmitted/founder Envs, each of which we show to be capable
of eliciting FP bNAbs in RMs. The novel aspect of this application is that we propose to enhance the efficiency
of priming, boosting and affinity maturation steps by designing new SHIVs with selected glycans deleted
surrounding the FP site of vulnerability. We show that such SHIVs replicate efficiently and immunofocus early B
cell responses to FP epitopes leading to neutralization breadth and potency. By deciphering Env-Ab coevolution
leading to consistent bNAb induction in SHIV infection, we will then design and test new FP targeted protein
immunogens that are practical for vaccine development. Specific aims are: (i) to construct novel SHIVs with
BG505, CH1012 and Ce1176 Envs that are depleted of N-linked glycan sites surrounding the FP and to
characterize their antigenicity, neutralization sensitivity, infectivity and replication in primary rhesus CD4+ T cells;
(ii) to infect RMs with glycan-depleted SHIVs from Aim #1, epitope-map autologous and heterologous
neutralizing antibody responses, identify germline B cell precursors to FP bNAbs and decipher molecular
patterns of Env-Ab coevolution leading to neutralization breadth; (iii) to design novel Env trimers corresponding
to key Env immunotypes that bind FP bNAb UCAs and intermediate stage Abs and to express them as stabilized
prefusion Env trimer immunogens; and (iv) to conduct a proof-of-concept preclinical vaccine trial in RMs testing
the hypothesis that SHIV-guided, B lineage-designed Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity-mature bNAb
responses in RMs to an extent that is superior to conventional immunogens and that these bNAbs protect RMs
against low-dose intrarectal challenge by heterologous tier-2 SHIVs."

The most prevalent skeletal condition in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is dystrophic scoliosis, a
debilitating and disfiguring disorder characterized by severe, short-segment angulation of the spine leading to
multiple clinical complications. Clinical management is currently limited to invasive and repeated surgeries, and
case presentations are very variable, suggesting that underlying etiology is different from one patient to the next.
The lack of effective treatment to prevent or treat this condition reflects the fact that the pathophysiology of NF1
dystrophic scoliosis is unknow.
The novel scientific idea introduced in this proposal is that Nf1 loss-of-function in the intervertebral disc (IVD)
affects the formation and maintenance of IVD-vertebra unit, and that the cell-of-origin and timing of Nf1 loss-of-
function during development dictate severity and speed of progression of NF1 scoliosis, in clinical cases where
dystrophic scoliosis is not associated with paraspinal neurofibromas. This hypothesis is based on the severe IVD
and vertebral dysplasia observed in mice lacking Nf1 in all cells of the IVD, and on the report of a clinical case
of NF1 dystrophic scoliosis associated with NF1 loss-of-heterozygosity in IVD cells. To address this hypothesis
and to identify the cell-of-origin causing this IVD and spine dysplasia, we will characterize the formation and
maintenance of the IVD-vertebra units in embryos lacking Nf1 in either notochordal cells/nucleus pulposus cells
or in sclerotomal progenitor cells that give rise to cartilage end plates, annulus fibrosus and vertebral bodies. In
Aim 1, the generated conditional mutant mice will be compared at several developmental stages to characterize
the consequences of Nf1 loss in each IVD compartment and upon Nf1 deletion at embryonic versus postnatal
stage. In Aim 2, we will obtain an unbiased list of candidate genes and pathways as foundation to explore how
the loss of Nf1 in the different IVD compartments affects formation and maintenance of the IVD-vertebra units,
using laser-assisted microdissection of the IVD and RNA sequencing. Doing so and coupled to findings from
Aim 1, we aim at understanding how Nf1 loss-of-function in specific compartments of the IVD alters each IVD
compartment and the interactions between adjacent ones to contribute to the initiation and severity of NF1
dystrophic scoliosis. This knowledge will be the foundation to discover new and targeted options for a
personalized management of patients with NF1 dystrophic scoliosis."
10893700,"Project Summary
The craniofacial complex exhibits enormous diversity across vertebrate species and is also one of the most
affected in human congenital anomalies. This high degree of variation in evolution and disease is reflected by
the complexity of craniofacial development. Formation of the head and face involves interactions between cell
types from all major germ layers. Subsequently, the structures that emerge serve to support the brain and
sensory organs, features underlying the successful radiation of vertebrates. In recent years, innovations in
genetics, genomics, and imaging have rapidly advanced our mechanistic understanding of craniofacial
development. These insights into craniofacial development have in turn informed our understanding of how
development is altered in evolution and disease, and how developmental principles can be applied to therapeutic
interventions in craniofacial repair. The scientific program will focus on how emerging technologies (e.g., single-
cell approaches and human stem cell technology) are synergizing with classical embryological and genetic
approaches to advance our understanding of craniofacial development, disease, and regeneration. A keynote
session will explore the earliest stages of human craniofacial development, the study of which is being made
possible by new single-cell approaches and human stem cell technology. We will discuss how these emerging
technologies are being applied to animal models of major craniofacial anomalies, expanding our ability to study
craniofacial development in diverse non-model organisms, and leading to new approaches to correct and repair
craniofacial differences. The conference will encourage a range of scientific and technological approaches while
fostering an inclusive forum for colleagues from a wide range of backgrounds. A goal of the conference is to
bring together leaders in the field and early-stage investigators, including those who are new to the craniofacial
field and those from underrepresented groups. In addition to enjoying presentations of cutting-edge, unpublished
research, a goal is to form collaborations between researchers with complementary yet distinct expertise that
will advance craniofacial research in the years ahead."
10893780,"PROJECT SUMMARY. We propose an innovative research education program, “Developing Research
Leaders in Global Infectious Diseases in Women.” Our goals are to address the knowledge gap in sex
differences in global infectious diseases, and to train the next generation of clinical investigators in this field. In
2014, our team founded the Women in Global Health Research Initiative which hosted two-day scientific
conferences in global health and provided a high-impact training program for international female researchers.
This initiative, now in its 9th year, has become a research community for both expert scientists and trainees in
global health with over 80 faculty and 300 trainees across 27 countries. Over 80% of our trainees are focused
on global infectious diseases in women. We now propose to leverage this initiative to expand educational
training in infectious diseases in women and provide structured career development to a broader pool of United
States and international early-stage investigators focused on global infectious diseases in women.
 Our program includes two components: (1) an annual “Global Infectious Diseases across a Woman's
Lifespan” course; and (2) a “Global Infectious Diseases and Women's Health (GIDWH)” Scholars Program.
The scientific course will provide didactic training in sex differences in global infectious diseases (HIV, TB,
malaria, respiratory infections), host-immunology across the woman's lifespan, treatment, prevention, and
social determinants that contribute to poor health outcomes for women. The course will also provide practical
tools to conduct research in women's health in the U.S. and internationally, and networking opportunities with
peers and senior leaders in the field. The GIDWH Scholars Program will consist of a competitively-selected
group of early-stage investigators. Scholars will receive longitudinal training over two years to strengthen and
complement ongoing research training with their primary scientific mentor at their home institution. GIDWH
Scholar training will include peer mentorship cohorts for leadership training, and Research Advisory Teams of
senior researchers with technical or topical expertise specific to the scholar's research interests. Scholars will
receive research-enabling funds to augment their career progression. Over five years, 200 early-stage
investigators will attend the educational course, of whom 10 per year (years 1-4) will be selected to participate
in the two-year GIDWH Scholars Program (40 total). Our proposed program aligns with the NIAID's women's
health mission to “conduct and support basic and translational research to understand, diagnose, prevent and
treat infectious diseases that impact the health of women and girls.” Through combining didactic research
training with individualized leadership training and career development, we expect that trainees will improve
their understanding of the complex biologic and social determinants that contribute to sex differences in global
infectious diseases. Further, we anticipate that this research education program will further their ability to
conduct research to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of global infectious diseases in women."
10893897,"K-12 students are a critical demographic that need skills to make educated decisions on complex issues
related to climate and health, yet few curricula exist that address the topics at this level. Most current climate
and health curricula were developed for medical training programs in response to a call from trainees.
Introducing climate change and health earlier may prepare students more thoroughly for a range of biomedical
careers. Covering the topic in middle and high school also makes education on this important topic accessible
to the broader population. Science classrooms present the opportunity for students to build climate literacy
through the lens of hope and in-progress solutions, an approach shown to be a motivator in solving problems.
To address the need for materials, the Genetic Science Learning Center (GSLC) at the University of Utah
will use its award-winning expertise to develop four innovative curriculum mini-modules. The modules will
address topics not yet included in textbooks, and emphasize how science is driving real solutions to the
challenges surrounding climate and health. The modules will flexibly integrate with topics teachers already
cover, and support student achievement of standards described in A Framework for K-12 Science
Education. The goals for The Biology of Climate Change: Impacts on Human Health and the Science of
Solutions project are:
 GOAL 1: Engage secondary-level students with climate and health literacy via new curricula so
they can make educated decisions on the many complex issues surrounding climate change and the
risks it presents to human health. Approach: Involve teachers at schools with a majority of students from
groups underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) in drafting each module, testing lessons with their
students, and refining the materials. Conduct 2 research studies for each mini-module: an RCT comparison
with standard climate change curricula of impacts on students’ beliefs and intentions, and an efficacy study of
the modules’ impact on NGSS-aligned student learning.
 GOAL 2: Educate teachers about the impacts of climate change on health and prepare them to
implement the four new mini-modules via online professional development courses and conference
workshops. Approach: Offer 2 online courses for teachers to prepare them to use the mini-modules, and
present workshops at science teacher conferences, reaching at least 300 teachers across the US.
 The project will take advantage of the GSLC’s award-winning expertise in developing effective interactive
multimedia learning experiences; its published methods for involving teachers in curriculum development; and
its extensive experience in teacher professional development. The modules will be broadly disseminated via
our Learn.Genetics and Teach.Genetics websites, which are used annually by >16 million visitors worldwide."

 Animal cells achieve and maintain a typical volume through the regulation of ion channels that control osmotic
processes. In metazoans, development of properly proportioned bodies also requires volume regulation to be
coordinated amongst cells within tissues and across organs and systems. Although ion channels regulating cell
volume have been identified in cells in culture, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate cell volume
and coordinate volume control throughout whole tissues in vivo. Our proposed studies will investigate in zebrafish
a new and conserved pathway controlling cell volume and integrity in vacuolated cells of the notochord. Using
genetic, cell biological, physiological, and quantitative in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we will define the
physiological mechanisms regulating fluid transport and cell volume in response to mechanical cues."

and altered cognition and behavior is clear, how KDM5C functions to orchestrate gene expression programs
that mediate critical neuronal processes, and therefore the consequence of variants for mechanisms of IDD,
remains unknown. The lack of fundamental knowledge regarding KDM5C has left patients and caregivers with
limited options regarding targeted and standardized treatment options. This initially led to the formation of a
KDM5C support group on Facebook in 2017, and to the formation of a non-profit the KDM5C advocacy
research education and support (KARES) foundation in 2022. In its first year of existence, the KARES
Foundation began data collection program through RARE-X/Global Genes, hosted a virtual KDM5C research
update and raised sufficient funds to support a pilot project grant to develop a robust biomarker for KDM5C.
We now seek funds to help support the first KDM5C focused conference that will bring together families,
researchers, and clinicians with the overarching goals of promoting research and developing clinical best
practices for treating affected individuals."

This training program is dedicated toward increasing the number of active clinicians who oversee an
extramurally funded basic science research program. Unfortunately, only two percent of physicians are
engaged in research and can be identified as physician-scientists. The Education Committee of the Society of
University Otolaryngologists concluded that innovative training programs should work to develop research
skills in their trainees by providing protected time for research activities. For this reason, the overall goal of the
proposed Training Program is to foster the development of research skills (both basic and translational) in
selected individuals from the pool of talented otolaryngology residents and fellows at the University of
Pittsburgh, who are interested in head and neck oncology. To our knowledge, this is one of the very few
training programs in an Otolaryngology residency and an American Head & Neck Society (AHNS) accredited
fellowship program supported by the NCI, dedicated to training physician-scientists in the area of head and
neck oncology. The unique training opportunities supported by this grant have allowed us to recruit talented
trainees who are interested pursuing academic careers in head and neck oncology.
The aims of the program are to: 1) provide training in research methodology that will foster the developing
clinician’s ability to become an independent investigator; and 2) to prepare the trainee for an academic career.
Interfacing this research program with the Otolaryngology Residency Program and the Fellowship in Advanced
Head and Neck Oncologic Surgery provides two outstanding pools of applicants for selection as trainees. It
also enables trainees to acquire an education in both clinical skills and basic research approaches, with the
ultimate goal of establishing an independent research program. Trainees may choose from preceptors from a
wide variety of disciplines in head and neck oncology-related fields to accommodate diverse research
backgrounds and interests. In addition, trainees can participate in a unique Research Training Program at the
University of Pittsburgh, which is part of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)
(3UL1RR024153-03S209), and have the opportunity to take several formal courses, participate in seminar
programs and journal clubs, and are also be required to complete the web-based research integrity course
offered by the School of Medicine. The trainee’s progress during the Otolaryngology residency program as well
as the effectiveness of the preceptor and overall program is monitored and evaluated by an Advisory
Committee composed of members of the academic community with extensive training experiences.
A second track is embedded within the Fellowship in Advanced Head and Neck Oncologic Surgery, accredited
by the American Head and Neck Society. As fellowship director, Dr. Duvvuri and his fellowship selection
committee carefully select outstanding candidates with a particular interest in translational research and a
career in academic head and neck oncology. These fellows spend at least 2 years, with focused clinical
activity, and protected, dedicated research blocks to permit their development of an independent project worth
and ready for K-type grant submission by the end of their T32 training period."

A major advantage of coincidence detection of annihilation photons from positron-emitting radiotracers is the
availability of time-of-flight (TOF) information, and the ability to measure TOF differences to better localize the
positron emitter. Normally for positron emission tomography (PET), TOF information is used as a weighting
kernel during image reconstruction and results in an effective sensitivity gain that can be used to reduce radiation
dose, improve signal-to-noise ratio, or reduce scan duration. The magnitude of these benefits depend on the
TOF resolution, which is governed by the timing performance of the detectors. Current state of the art for PET
scanners is ~220 ps which corresponds to a localization of ~3.3 cm. A transformational change would occur,
however, if a TOF resolution of <30 ps could be achieved. This would localize events within 4.5 mm, allowing
images to be directly generated without a reconstruction algorithm at a spatial resolution that matches what is
achieved in clinical PET scanners today. We refer to this as direct positron emission imaging (PEI). With this
superb TOF resolution and reconstruction-free imaging, we enter a new regime where we expect major increases
in image signal-to-noise, both due to the additional TOF information, and the removal of noise amplification
inherent in reconstructing noisy data with noisy corrections from projection data. We propose to develop a first
proof-of-concept imaging system that uses ultra-fast detectors to directly produces cross-sectional images
without reconstruction and to quantify the performance of PEI both through simulations and experimentally.
Since direct PEI does not have the same sampling constraints for data collection as PET, it creates opportunities
for portable, and flexible imaging devices, with implications for patient-tailored or task-specific imaging
applications (i.e. cardiac or breast imaging), as well as open designs for general purpose applications.
To achieve the unprecedented TOF capabilities needed for direct PEI, we will exploit promptly emitted Cerenkov
radiation that is generated with <10 ps in certain materials, including scintillators, in response to a 511 keV
photon interaction. Our proposed novel detector design integrates a Cerenkov radiator directly into the entrance
window of an ultra-fast microchannel plate photomultiplier tube, which is the fastest photon detector currently
available with a response time of 25 ps. This approach eliminates all optical reflections between the point of light
generation and the photocathode, preserving the prompt timing nature of Cerenkov photons. We then combine
the integrated Cerenkov radiator detector with auxiliary photodetector read-out for robust coincidence detection,
and complement this with advanced signal processing algorithms we have pioneered using convolutional neural
networks to extract all possible timing information from the digitized detector waveforms and ultimately to perform
reconstruction-free imaging using only the digitized waveforms as input. In summary, we aim to prove that direct
PEI is possible, to characterize its properties and to provide the technological and algorithmic foundations for
eventual translation for human imaging."

Injuries of the growth plate account for nearly 20% of all fractures in children and often result in impaired bone
growth. Once damaged, cartilage tissue of the growth plate is often replaced by unwanted bone tissue. This
“bony bar” can cause angular deformities of the bone or stunt longitudinal bone growth. Angiogenesis is
known to precede bony bar formation after growth plate injury, yet the mechanistic underpinnings of this (and
by extension the means to prevent it) are poorly understood.
Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated an essential role for skeletal sensory nerves in the
regulation of skeletal cells and tissues. Most skeletal neurons are NGF (Nerve growth factor) responsive TrkA
(Tropomyosin receptor kinase A) fibers, which our group has shown to interact with skeletal tissues to
influence skeletal development and repair. Most recently, we reported that TrkA+ neurons regulate vascular
proliferation and angiogenesis. This work has led us to the entirely new hypothesis that skeletal sensory
neurons may regulate response to growth plate injury, potentially via regulation of angiogenesis, and that this
could be targeted therapeutically. To assess this hypothesis, our studies are divided into two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. Identify molecular determinants of sensory neural regulation of growth plate injury
response. We will utilize multi-tissue single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to map the neuroskeletal
interactions after growth plate injury. Analysis of both the injured physis and neural soma in the corresponding
lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons will recreate the neuro-skeletal interactome before and after injury.
Next, experiments will be performed within TrkAF592A transgenic animals, in which injury site innervation and
bony bar formation are attenuated. Our Aim 1 hypotheses are that: (1) chemical-genetic neuronal inhibition
may disrupt pathologic bony bar formation, and growth plate angiogenesis, and (2) single cell sequencing will
map the neuro-skeletal interactome and predict neural regulatory mechanisms.
Specific Aim 2. Target sensory neurons via a small molecule inhibitor to prevent growth plate
innervation and bony bar formation. In Aim 2, we will utilize a small molecule inhibitor of TrkA (AR786) in
order to pharmacologically target TrkA signaling so as to inhibit growth plate injury site innervation, vascularity
and bony bar formation. Studies will be performed in Thy1-YFP reporter animals which permit visualization of
nerve ingrowth during growth plate repair. Our Aim 2 hypothesis is that small molecule TrkA inhibition during
growth plate injury will prevent injury site innervation and pathologic bony bar formation."

The overall goal of this renewal application is to validate biomarker signatures associated with aberrantly
expressing pathways in pancreatic cancer for early stage PDAC detection among asymptomatic patients with
high risk clinical, genetic and/or familial susceptibility characteristics. PDAC early detection signatures,
developed with circulating transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics (omics) biomarkers identified in the
first funding cycle, will be characterized for their association with heterogeneous disease subtypes and integrated
with imaging-based disease subtype features derived with machine learning methods from CT/MRI scans
reflecting functional changes in malignant lesions of the pancreas. Integration of Omics data with CT imaging
features will be done by developing Multimodal Integrative Analytical Models (MIAM) predictive of early
stage pancreatic cancer. Together, the pathway-based biomarker panels integrated with CT imaging data will
define a novel clinically significant strategy for early detection and risk stratification. During the first funding cycle,
a number of omics based circulating biomarkers were developed and validated in multiple sample cohorts from
patients with early stage resectable disease. These together with additional candidate biomarkers in the pipeline
will be further validated and investigated for their association with disease subtypes in Phases II, III and IV
studies according to PRoBE-design in the renewal application. For phase IV studies, performance of the
biomarkers in detecting disease and predicting clinical outcomes among asymptomatic patients and at-risk
individuals will be ascertained with retrospective and prospective longitudinal pre-diagnostic sample cohorts,
including one representing the underserved population. The innovative statistical approach of MIAM will be
shared with other members of the consortia for rigorous validation and in the long term, we hope to translate the
findings into developing open source software for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories in the future.
Specific Aims of the PCDC grant are:
Aim 1: Validation of pathway-associated biomarker signatures and novel CT imaging features for
molecular subtype-related early stage PDAC and development of MIAM to integrate approaches for
detection of early stage PDAC in Phase II cohorts.

Phase III retrospective longitudinal pre-diagnostic cohorts for early detection and risk assessment.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene located on the X chromosome.
AAV-based gene therapies for DMD are expected to provide functional compensation in both skeletal and
cardiac muscles via systematic delivery of a micro-dystrophy minigene. However, the size limit of the rAAV vector
poses a major barrier to the effort for improving expression specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Gene editing has
the potential to permanently correct the mutations of exon deletions that lead to a premature truncated protein
in the majority of DMD patients. However, the CRISPR-based approaches require multiple components working
together to achieve a therapeutic effect in gene editing, and fitting all of these components within a single AAV
vector is challenging. This challenge is particularly prominent in DMD gene therapy, due to the whole-body
treatment via systematic delivery necessitating high vector doses and the inclusion of muscle-specific expression
regulation elements. rAAV2/HBoV1, in which an rAAV2 genome is pseudopackaged by the capsid of a
respiratory human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), has been developed for cystic fibrosis gene therapy, due to its superior
apical tropism to human airway epithelium and a large cargo size. The 5.9-kb package capacity of rAAV2/HBoV1
makes it suitable for DMD gene therapies through both gene replacement and gene editing approaches.
However, in spite of the fact that rAAV2/HBoV1 can transduce the primary human myotube in in vitro cultures
and mouse skeletal muscles in vivo, the transduction efficiency is lower than that of rAAV. To overcome this
limitation, this proposal aims to develop myotropic rAAV2/HBoV1 vectors of improved tropisms to skeletal and
cardiac muscles. Structural biology studies have revealed that AAV and HBoV share conserved features of the
compositions and locations of their variable region (VR) loops on the capsid surface. Directed evolution of AAV
capsid libraries in mouse muscle has identified several myotropic AAV (MyoAAV) that display a 7-mer peptide
bearing an “RGD” motif at the VR VIII on the capsid surface. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that the
insertion of a 7-mer peptide at the VR IV or VIII of the HBoV1 capsid surface did not disrupt the production of
mutants; and we also created an infectious hybrid parvovirus of AAV2 and HBoV1, iAAV2-HBoV1, to enable the
production of high titer HBoV1 capsid libraries in the context of a replication competent rAAV2 genome. Thus, in
this application, we propose to identify myotropic HBoV1 capsid (MyoBoV) variants from directed evolution of
HBoV1 capsid libraries that display RGD containing the 7-mer peptide in HSA-Cre79 mice, which specifically
express Cre recombinase (CRE) in striated muscles. For efficient variant screening, we will incorporate the CRE-
based BoV Targeted Evolution (CREBTE) platform. We will characterize the transduction profile of the MyoBoV
variants in various mouse tissues/organs, as well as their capability in transducing primary human myoblasts
and differentiated myotubes. The proposed directed evolution platform is also of great utility to engineer a
bocaviral capsid to target desired tissues/organs, and thus to expand the toolbox of parvovirus vectors."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common pediatric chronic medical condition that involves a complex daily regimen.
Most children and adolescents with T1D do not meet glycemic control recommendations, suggesting that many
likely struggle to manage T1D effectively. Behavioral interventions exist to help youth with T1D engage with their
treatment regimen and achieve lower glycemic levels. However, in diabetes clinics, it is challenging to implement
these interventions because they are costly to deliver, often involve multiple sessions spanning weeks or months,
and require access to mental health providers. The recently emphasized practice of depression screening in
pediatric diabetes clinics has increased the number of mental health referrals, as 20-30% of youth with T1D
endorse elevated depressive symptoms. Yet, most pediatric diabetes clinics are understaffed with mental health
providers, and only <25% of youth referred for outpatient treatment follow through with an appointment. Targeted
single-session interventions (SSIs) may alleviate barriers to accessing traditional outpatient therapy and reduce
depressive symptoms in youth with T1D, but an SSI that incorporates evidence-based strategies to treat
depressive symptoms and lower HbA1C for youth with T1D does not yet exist. The proposed K23 career
development award aims to address these gaps in research and clinical care by adapting and pilot testing a
T1D-specific depression SSI integrated into pediatric T1D medical care. The first goal is to create a T1D-specific
depression SSI treatment manual by eliciting feedback from a small group of adolescents. The second goal is to
examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an integrated T1D-specific depression SSI approach
in a randomized pilot trial to reduce depressive symptoms and lower glycemic levels in youth with T1D. The third
goal is to understand the barriers and facilitators of implementing the SSI approach in diabetes clinics for further
refinement in follow-up testing. Piloting an integrated SSI approach could lead to improvements in the acute and
long-term psychological and physical health of youth with T1D and increase the accessibility, scalability, and
cost-effectiveness of psychological treatment within pediatric T1D care. Moreover, this research plan supports
the candidates’ career development goals of gaining advanced training in clinical trial research design and
methods, becoming an expert in feasible and flexible intervention designs (e.g., SSIs), enhancing knowledge of
integrated healthcare in pediatric diabetes, and developing interventions that minimize barriers to care. Through
a combination of formal didactics and direct mentored training experiences with her mentoring team, Dr. Monzon
will gain the necessary knowledge and skills to implement the proposed research project and transition toward
an independent research career. Further, the findings from the proposed project will inform an R01 application
to conduct a larger, multisite randomized trial that has sufficient power to examine the efficacy of the T1D-specific
depression SSI."

Food insecurity, having unreliable access to enough affordable and nutritious food, affects 1 in 10 Americans.
Food insecurity leads to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including diabetes,
hypertension, and low diet quality. Adopting healthy dietary patterns can substantially decrease cardiovascular
disease risk, but the cost of healthy foods is a barrier. Food pantries are an important and accessible
community resource for people with food insecurity. In recent decades, food pantries have adopted new
technologies to improve client access and choice. In menu-based food pantries, clients shop for foods using an
online menu, creating opportunities to encourage healthy food selection through small changes in the menu to
increase visibility and appeal of certain foods, called “nudges.” Digital nudges have not been designed for or
widely implemented in menu pantries, and lack of client engagement in creating acceptable nudges for
charitable food settings is a critical implementation barrier. In the proposed K23 project, Dr. Jenny Jia uses
systematic engagement of pantry clients, staff, and other stakeholders to codesign digital nudges that are
acceptable, feasible, and increase healthy food selection. In Aim 1, we will engage menu pantry clients and
staff in systematic codesign to adapt digital nudges for an online menu, using serial interviews and focus
groups to obtain formative feedback to adapt and beta test digital nudge prototypes to increase acceptability.
After consolidating digital nudges into one intervention, in Aim 2, we will test and refine implementation of the
digital nudge intervention in one menu pantry. We will use an iterative, mixed methods approach with pantry
staff to integrate the digital nudge intervention into pantry operations. In Aim 3, we will evaluate preliminary
effectiveness of the digital nudge intervention on nutritional quality of client food selection in a pilot type 1
hybrid intervention study. To measure change due to implementation, we will use an interrupted time series on
longitudinal menu orders from all pantry clients in 3 intervention pantries, comparing 6 months of pre-
intervention to 6 months of during-intervention data. In addition, we will identify implementation facilitators and
barriers and determine feasibility of longitudinally measuring diet quality, blood pressure, and weight in pantry
clients, comparing in-person to remote approaches, to inform methods for a future effectiveness trial. To
effectively accomplish the aims, Dr. Jia has created a comprehensive training plan with the collaboration of her
multidisciplinary mentorship team to gain expertise in systematic codesign methods, implementation science,
and pragmatic evaluations. This proposal aligns with NHLBI’s Behavioral Economics in Implementation
Research priority and NHLBI’s Strategic Vision. Completion of the training plan and proposed project will
prepare Dr. Jia to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing, testing, and implementing
innovative and effective community-based strategies to improve food environments, diet quality, and

10882340,"The ovarian hormone estrogen promotes binge drinking and contributes to sex differences in alcohol abuse.
Interestingly, we found an association between estrogen signaling and the brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine,
5-HT) system, a key modulator of alcohol intake. For example, both estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ) are
highly expressed in the 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe (5-HTDRN), the largest serotonergic neural population
and a major source of 5-HT. Notably, chronic binge-like ethanol intake led to sex-specific alterations in mRNA
expression of ERα and 5-HT-related genes in the DRN in mice, suggesting a potential role of estrogen/ERs/5-
HT signaling in binge drinking. Notably, we found that either ERα or ERβ agonist treatment attenuated the
stimulatory effects of alcohol on 5-HTDRN neurons, which may contribute to the higher levels of binge drinking in
females. We also showed that chemogenetic activation of ERαDRN or ERβDRN neurons reduced binge drinking in
female mice. These results support a model in which estrogen acts on ERα/β to prevent alcohol-induced
activation on 5-HTDRN neurons, leading to higher binge alcohol drinking. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue
three aims in the current grant. (1) We will test whether ERα and ERβ expressed by 5-HTDRN neurons are required
for estrogenic regulation of alcohol binge drinking. (2) We will determine whether estrogen signaling mediates
the sex dimorphic response of 5-HTDRN neurons to alcohol excitation. (3) We will determine the 5-HTDRN
downstream neural circuit that mediate the stimulatory effects of estrogens on alcohol binge drinking. Thus, the
proposed studies will be able to identify the specific receptor, neural population, neuronal firing, and neural circuit
mechanisms that mediate estrogens’ stimulatory effects on binge drinking. This proposal will investigate one of
the fundamental mechanisms contributing to the sex-dimorphism of excessive drinking. The results will provide
novel information for identifying new targets to develop more effective, individualized treatment for binge drinking
and alcohol-use disorders."

In this application, we request continuation of MH123184, which aimed to understand how
genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells and thereby produces psychopathology. Our research
developed statistical methods to integrate single cell and tissue-level transcriptomic data. We targeted
methods to identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, to
understand how genes act in concert to confer risk for psychopathology. We also took advantage of an
exciting new avenue of research to approach these challenges, namely CRISPR screening. This innovation
has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the effects of genetic perturbations on the entire
transcriptome at a single-cell level. Here we propose research covering three related themes, all of which
capitalize on CRISPR advancements: (1) develop powerful and well-calibrated tests for the effect of CRISPR
perturbations on gene expression by inferring latent factors; (2) develop methods for removing the effect of
unmeasured confounders in high throughput screens; and (3) develop methods for imputation and
denoising for multiomic data that facilitate downstream testing of omic readouts. Each of these aims is
motivated by pressing needs in the field. First, due to small samples and the sparsity of the response
variable, it is essential that we enhance the power and interpretability of CRISPR tests by accounting for co-
regulation and convergent function of genes. Aim 1 achieves this purpose by estimating latent factors that
represent co-regulated genes and by inferring a similarity matrix among gene perturbations. As CRISPR
screens advance to more biologically complex settings, such as model organisms, unmeasured confounders
will play a more important role, and new methods are needed to control for these effects. Aim 2 develops
two approaches to this challenge: an innovative use of negative control variables, as motivated by the
causal literature, and key advances to the classic surrogate variable analysis method. For the field to move
toward efficient use of multiomic data, data derived from multiple sources will be required. These
resources will invariably have missing data. Methods to account for imputation of missing data are needed.
Tools developed for variational autoencoders show great promise; however, as described in Aim 3, they
need to be paired with semiparametric inference tools to ensure robust and well calibrated downstream
analysis. By applying what we learn from these three aims to available resources, most from distributed
resources and some from our collaborations, we expect to shed more light on the neurobiological
mechanisms of mental illness. We are well positioned to move between theory and data because
we have a diverse team of investigators lead by the PI (Roeder), who has decades of experience
in statistical genomic field and co-investigators Wasserman and Lei, who are experts in theory and
methods for high dimensional and causal inference. The proposed research fits Goal 1 of NIMH’s

10881375,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be rapidly progressing and fatal. In instances where the
triggering allergen is not known, establishing the etiology of anaphylaxis is pivotal to long-term risk management.
Our recent work has identified a novel IgE antibody response to a mammalian oligosaccharide epitope,
galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), that has been associated with two distinct forms of anaphylaxis: i)
immediate onset anaphylaxis during first exposure to intravenous cetuximab, and ii) delayed onset anaphylaxis
3-6 hours after ingestion of mammalian food products (e.g., beef and pork). The overarching goal for this renewal
is to define whether the risk for development of an alpha-gal IgE response is intrinsic to the host (genetics) or
external with a specific factor in ticks. These studies will provide insight into the factors that govern allergic
responses and control IgE production more generally.
 The significance of investigating these reactions comes not only from the obvious importance of understanding
a novel life-threatening form of food allergy, but also because of the possibility of defining a totally new
mechanism for reactions related to an important food substance. Our plan of research focuses on using a cutting-
edge, combined transcriptomic (single cell RNA sequencing) and surface marker expression approach to deeply
immunophenotype the cells in humans with alpha-gal allergy. This approach will allow us to define the factors
underpinning how tick bites transcriptionally initiate the IgE response. We believe that IgE to alpha-gal represents
a novel cause of food allergy and overall, these studies are uniquely positioned to provide additional insight into
a recently recognized allergic response that affects >40,000 patients in the U.S. alone and position the research
to make important advances for prevention and treatment of alpha-gal syndrome (AGS)."
10881494,"MECHANISMS OF MOTOR SUPERPERFORMANCE: ABSTRACT
Clinical experience and world population-level data indicate that most neurological disability stems from motor
dysfunction. Yet, spontaneous superperformer mutations occur in a variety of persons and animals, illustrating
that the intrinsic motor capacity of the organism can be augmented. We set out to identify similar mutations by
rotarod screening of 32,726 laboratory mice harboring chemically induced random mutations with the goal of
mechanistically explaining motor superperformance. In this context, we have discovered that a point mutation in
an unsuspected gene, Rif1 (Replication Timing Regulatory Factor 1), converts a single mouse residue to the
primate one and confers supernormal motor ability. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) Rif1-mutant mice, we have determined that this superperformance is a motor-selective
phenotype manifest upon several motor tasks but devoid of other effects upon various rigorous behavioral and
longevity analyses. Rif1-mutant mice also exhibit enhanced recovery from stroke in the motor cerebral cortex.
The superperformance mechanism is unknown: although Rif1 participates in DNA repair and in transcriptional
regulation via G4 folded DNA structural stabilization, little is known about its function in the nervous system.
There is precedent that DNA repair may be associated with synaptic transmission strength, while DNA G4
regulation could enhance the transcription of genes active in the motor system. We have strengthened this
hypothetical framework by identifying several consequences of the Rif1 mutation: a) Altered Purkinje cell firing
regularity and local field potential changes in mouse cerebellum, which can influence movement precision, with
change of these neurophysiological parameters upon locomotion on a treadmill; b) Increased cellular resistance
to DNA-damaging radiation; c) Increased cell resistance to G4 stabilization; d) Overexpression of a fraction of
the cerebellar (but not forebrain or spinal cord) synaptic transcriptome including potential Rif1 mutation mediators
such as Kcnma1, Kif5c and Nab2; e) These transcripts may be relevant to the phenotype because we show that
their loss of function degrades motor performance, whereas f) Cerebellar injection of adenovirus-containing Nab2
induces superperformance. Thus, we will expand current cerebellar learning conceptions by postulating that the
Rif1 mutation facilitates DNA repair and/or loosens G4 DNA folding leading to upregulation of synaptic
transcripts, with either one or both mechanisms modifying the range or precision of cerebellar synapse activity
that underlies movement control. To this effect, we will conduct neurophysiological studies, study the function of
native RIF1, manipulate Nab2, Kcnma1 and Kif5c expression levels, and investigate DNA repair and DNA G4
regulation to test which of these mechanisms enable the superperformance phenotype. We will also investigate
if enhanced stroke recovery also partakes from the same cerebellar neurophysiological mechanism to enable
future work on this important observation."

Clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is significantly reduced in lungs of patients with the fibrosing lung
disorder, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Mechanism/s responsible for halted efferocytosis and the potential
benefit of restoring efferocytosis to fibrosis resolution has yet to be determined. The major goal of the proposed
studies is to establish how AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) affects macrophage population dynamics,
including influx of monocyte-derived transitional macrophages that promote fibrosis persistence versus
efferocytosis-competent populations involved in resolution of fibrosis. Macrophage dynamics and secretome will
be investigated in young-adult mice with resolving fibrosis, as well as the effect of AMPK-dependent stimulation
of efferocytosis and induced fibrosis resolution in aged mice. For specific role of AMPK in lung macrophages,
we will use AMPK deficient mice and adoptive transfer studies of macrophages in aged mice. The central
hypothesis is that: Senomorphic effects of AMPK promotes efferocytosis and resolution of age-associated
persistent lung fibrosis. Our Specific AIMs are designed to determine how AMPK activation affects macrophage
phenotypes for clearance of apoptotic cells during established lung fibrosis versus resolution (AIM 1). AIM2 will
establish the impact of AMPK activation in distinct areas of fibrotic vs. resolution niche, using spatial
transcriptomics, with focus on AMPK-dependent regulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal biogenesis to restore
efferocytotic competence in lung macrophages. AIM3 will delineate how AMPK activation reverses the non-
autonomous mechanism of efferocytosis suppression. Our findings will characterize efferocytosis-competent
macrophages in the fibrosis resolution niche, as well as the impact of AMPK on pro-fibrogenic population of MФs
(CX3CR1+SiglecF+). Furthermore, our findings is expected to motivate clinical studies of metformin or newer
classes of direct allosteric activators (e.g., MK-8722) of AMPK to test the gero-protective role of AMPK in chronic
fibrotic disorders such as IPF."

addition to the widely-known effects on glucose metabolism, diabetes is also associated with abnormalities in
lipid and amino acid metabolism including elevations in branched chain amino acids (BCAA). BCAAs are
increased in people with obesity and insulin resistance and high plasma BCAA concentrations are predictive of
future development of diabetes. Dietary restriction of BCAAs in rats improves insulin sensitivity and genome-
wide association studies in humans have demonstrated that genetic variations in enzymes controlling BCAA
metabolism are associated with increased BCAA concentrations and are also linked to the development of
insulin resistance. These data suggest that high BCAA concentrations play a causative role in the development
of insulin resistance and that strategies that correct accumulation of these bioactive amino acids may have
value as therapeutic avenues for treating diabetes. Circulating BCAA concentrations are regulated by dietary
intake, rates of protein synthesis and proteolysis, and BCAA catabolism. To be oxidized, BCAAs are first
reversibly converted to branched chain keto acids (BCKA) by branched chain aminotransferases. Next, BCKA
undergo oxidation that is catalyzed by the BCKA dehydrogenase (BCKDH) enzyme complex in the
mitochondrial matrix. BCKDH is regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation and is activated by a protein
phosphatase (PPM1K) that removes this covalent modification. Genetic or pharmacologic approaches to
reduce BCKDH phosphorylation lead to enhanced BCKA catabolism and improved insulin sensitivity in rodent
models of obesity. This application is designed to test the novel hypothesis that PPM1K phosphorylation at a
conserved serine residue suppresses the activity of this phosphatase leading to increased BCKDH
phosphorylation. Our studies are designed to identify mechanisms by which this phosphorylation is regulated,
define the effects of this covalent modification on intrinsic PPM1K activity, and determine the effects of PPM1K
phosphorylation on BCAA metabolism in liver of diabetic rodents."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox cofactor for energy metabolism and a co-substrate of
sirtuins for protein deacetylation. Cellular NAD+ levels decline with age in the heart and other organs. Previous
studies have shown that cellular NAD+ repletion or boosting is protective against aging and age-related
diseases. NAD+ is compartmentalized at subcellular levels and the proper distribution of NAD+ into
mitochondria is crucial for NAD+-dependent metabolic and signaling function in mitochondria. SLC25A51 was
recently identified as the primary mammalian mitochondrial NAD+ (mtNAD+) transporter that imports NAD+ from
cytosol into mitochondria. Unlike the established roles of NAD+ synthesis and consumption, there is a critical
knowledge gap in the role of mtNAD+ transport by SLC25A51 in aging and heart function. Despite the
important roles of mtNAD+ in mitochondrial energy metabolism and protein deacetylation, how mtNAD+ levels
change with age and impact cardiac aging remain unknown. Our preliminary study discovered that old murine
hearts had reduced mtNAD+ levels and lower SLC25A51 expression compared to young hearts. The objective
of this study is to determine the mechanistic role of SLC25A51 in cardiac aging using our newly
developed genetic tools to overexpress or knockdown SLC25A51 in the heart. Multiple preclinical studies
and clinical trials have examined or are investigating the therapeutic potential of various NAD+ boosting
strategies in different diseases. Importantly, the existing NAD+ boosting strategies do not directly boost
mtNAD+ levels, which may limit their efficacy. Our preliminary data showed that supplementation with an NAD+
precursor NMN significantly elevated total NAD+ levels in old murine hearts but did not effectively increase
mtNAD+ levels. This highlights the potential of enhancing mtNAD+ transport as a novel approach to improve
the benefits of NAD+ boosting strategies.
 We hypothesize that an age-related decline in SLC25A51 function reduces mtNAD+ levels, leading to
compromised mitochondrial metabolism and cardiac dysfunction. We also propose that enhancing
SLC25A51-mediated mtNAD+ transport will improve the protective effects of NAD+ boosting strategy in
the old heart. In this study, we will 1) determine if SLC25A51 deficiency lowers mtNAD+ levels and
accelerates cardiac aging; 2) determine if cardiac-specific SLC25A51 overexpression enhances mtNAD+ levels
and cardiac function in old mice; and 3) test the hypothesis that levels of SLC25A51 expression regulate the
efficacy of NAD+ precursor to improve cardiac function. The findings of this study will establish the roles of
SLC25A51 in cardiac aging and open new avenues towards developing new interventions to enhance mtNAD+
metabolism or to maximize the efficacy of NAD+ boosting strategies."

 The beta-2-adrenoceptor (2AR) is the most studied and best understood member of the G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily. And for good reason: it plays an important role in the regulating the function of numerous
cells types, and is the therapeutic target in the management of various diseases, including asthma. Indeed, the
last several decades have produced intensive research into how the 2AR is activated, and how it is regulated,
resulting in the development of new drugs, the majority being 2AR agonists with improved efficacy, duration of
action, and safety. Underlying these efforts have been basic science discoveries into how 2ARs are regulated,
with much of the research focused on discovering modes of receptor desensitization mediated by post-
translational modifications of the receptor. During the 25 years of HL05806, we have focused on establishing
mechanisms by which the 2AR is regulated in airway cells and in the context of lung and asthma biology, to
significantly advance our understanding of asthma pathobiology and the needs of asthma drug development.
 In this cycle of HL058506, we will explore a fascinating new mode of GPCR regulation recently discovered
to apply to 3 adrenoceptor (3AR) signaling and function in adipocytes by our co-I Tim McKinsey. In Bagchi et
al. (PNAS 2022), the McKinsey lab discovered that HDAC11 functions to de-myristoylate lysine residues on the
A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) gravin, which localizes the 3AR to plasma membrane lipid rafts, enabling
effective coupling with transmembrane signaling partners important for signaling and protective thermogenic
gene expression. New data generated herein by the Penn and McKinsey labs suggest a similar regulation of the
2AR in airway smooth muscle (ASM) exists, prompting us to pursue a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of
this novel mode of GPCR regulation by testing the hypothesis that inhibitory targeting of HDAC11
demyristoylation of gravin augments 2AR, and possibly EP receptor, signaling in ASM by preferentially
distributing receptors to plasma membrane signaling-competent domains, resulting in increased capacity of
these receptors to regulate ASM functions. The proposal is heavily weighted in basic science
biological/biochemical/imaging approaches to understand the mechanisms underlying HDAC11
regulation of ASM GPCRs, recognizing the importance of this foundation for understanding the ultimate
physiological and clinical significance of this phenomenon. In Aim 1 we will establish mechanisms of
HDAC11 regulation of gravin in HASM using molecular, genetic, and pharmacological strategies in ASM cultures.
In Aim 2 we will employ both heterologous expression systems as well as primary HASM cells to establish how
HDAC11 regulation of gravin regulates Gs-coupled GPCRs in ASM through regulation of receptor localization,
signaling, desensitization, and resensitization. In Aim 3 we will establish how HDAC11/gravin -dependent
regulation of GPCR signaling translates into altered GPCR function in ASM and the lung, and the effect of the
inhibiting HDAC11, using pharmacological and genetic means, on the in vivo asthma phenotype."

Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is a novel, MR-based method to map metabolism non-invasively in vivo.
DMI maps of glucose metabolism in patients with high grade brain tumors illustrate the detection of aberrant
metabolism (`Warburg effect') with high contrast, thereby showing a strong clinical potential to supplement
existing anatomical MRI with unique metabolic information. DMI is not the first MR-based metabolic imaging
modality, but stands on the shoulders of 1H, 13C, 31P and hyperpolarized 13C MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).
Unfortunately, none of these methods have reached their full clinical potential due to a variety of reasons
including technical complexity and lack of robustness and/or sensitivity. DMI is unique in that it is extremely
robust due to the simple MR acquisition methods, while providing good sensitivity and information content,
making it an ideal technique for broad dissemination in the clinical arena. Yet, adding DMI scans to a standard,
clinical MRI protocol is challenging because the relatively long scan time of DMI that can result in decreased
patient compliance and increased scanning costs. Fortunately, MRI and DMI are based on different, well-
separated resonance frequencies, opening the possibility to acquire DMI in parallel with MRI without increasing
the scan time. This is achieved by implementing DMI acquisitions during the short delays present in most MRI
methods to generate appropriate anatomical image contrast. Here we pursue the technological innovations
necessary to achieve high-quality and time-efficient parallel acquisition of MRI and DMI on a clinical MR scanner.
This overall goal will be achieved through three Aims, focused on hardware and software development followed
by in vivo evaluation. Aim 1 is focused on the development of a 1H/2H RF coil suitable for parallel MRI-DMI on
human brain in a clinical research setting. Primary design criteria are brain coverage and sensitivity for 1H and
2H, in addition to acceleration potential for 1H. Aim 2 addresses the development and implementation of parallel
MRI-DMI methods on a clinical 3 T Siemens platform. The selected MRI methods will resemble a standard,
clinical brain MR examination protocol and include FLAIR, T1-weighted MP-RAGE, diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Aim 3 is centered on a comparison between standard and
parallel MRI-DMI acquisitions on healthy volunteers to test the general design philosophy that parallel MRI and
DMI sensitivity, resolution and image contrast are unperturbed. Studies on patients with brain tumors are
performed to demonstrate the robustness of parallel MRI-DMI under real-world conditions. Upon successful
completion, this project will deliver the hardware and software necessary to achieve robust, parallel acquisition
of high-quality MRI and DMI at 3 T. Integration of DMI into existing neuro MRI methods will result in a
comprehensive imaging protocol that provides both standard anatomical and unique metabolic information of
the brain without increased total scan time. These technical developments will be key for many clinical sites to
gain access to DMI and drive its further development and validation via use in larger, diverse patient populations."

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) broadly describes the clonal expansion of blood cells
derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with somatic pre-leukemic mutation(s). CHIP is strongly linked to
aging and confers to an increased risk for blood cancers, non-hematological diseases, and all-cause mortality.
ASXL1 is one of the commonly mutated genes in CHIP. ASXL1 mutations are predominantly nonsense or
frameshift mutations. In particular, the hotspot frameshift mutation at codon 646 (corresponding to codon G643
in mice-Asxl1tm) represents a pathological CHIP mutation with high risk to drive myeloid diseases. We recently
discovered that Asxl1tm/+ bone marrow (BM) cells and HSCs underwent significant expansion in old/aged
recipients (20-24 months) but not in young recipients (2-4 months old). This expansion was associated with
alterations in epigenetic landscape. Further characterization of young vs old BM microenvironment (BMM) and
serum revealed local and systemic inflammation and expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and
endothelial cells (ECs), two important regulatory components of BM niche. MSC expansion was likely due to
enhanced MSC survival, while both accumulation of senescent cells and increased survival attributed to EC
expansion. Consistent with our observation, treatment of ABT-263, a potent inhibitor of anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, reduced the senescent MSCs in vitro. Moreover, ABT-263 effectively removed accumulated
MSCs, moderately reduced number of ECs, and partially mitigated the expansion of phenotypic HSCs in the old
mice. CITE-Seq analysis of RNA and ~120 immune cell surface proteins at single cell level identified aging-
associated cellular and molecular changes in old BM cells, including expansion of inflammatory neutrophil
subsets and overexpression of IL-1β. These alterations can be mitigated by dietary supplementation of
nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor. In addition, human myeloid leukemia cells with ASXL1 mutations
were sensitive to GSK525762 (GSK), a pan-BET inhibitor. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that
aged BMM promotes the expansion of Asxl1tm/+ HSCs. Targeting aged BMM and Asxl1tm/+ hematopoietic cells
through NR, ABT263, and/or GSK may prevent and/or inhibit Asxl1tm/+ HSC expansion. In this grant application,
we propose the following aims to test our hypothesis: 1) To investigate how aged BMM interacts with Asxl1tm/+
HSCs to promote their expansion; and 2) To determine whether targeting aged BMM and Asxl1tm/+ hematopoietic
cells alter Asxl1tm/+ HSC expansion in old recipients. Our proposal is in response to the SHINE Program from
NIA (PAS-22-096), aiming to provide new insights into the pathogenesis, prevention, and potential treatment of
nonmalignant hematologic diseases."
10880983,"7. Project Summary/Abstract: Technology for MR brain monitoring
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been the undisputed standard of care for the detection
and diagnosis of neurological disorders and injuries since its inception over 4 decades ago. The cost,
weight, size, and maintenance needs of MRI scanners, however, typically precludes their use in some
locations with perhaps the greatest need - including Emergency Departments, Neurological Intensive
Care Units (ICUs), surgical suites, sports fields, battlefields, rural healthcare sites, and ambulances.
This has started to change with the emergence of low-field “point-of-care” scanners, such as those
developed by our group and others. Still, even these mobile units are not designed to be used as a
patient monitoring device akin to how a pulse-oximeter is used. A new approach is needed to create
a true “brain monitor” using MRI.
 In this work, build on our proof-of-concept prototype 7 kg brain monitor, the “MR Cap” to develop
and evaluate an inexpensive device that can be deployed, not bedside, but within the patient bed.
Once in place, the device can acquire imaging information at regular intervals and alert the care team
to changes associated with increased intracranial pressure or hemorrhage. To achieve this, we relax
magnetic field strength and homogeneity constraints to allow lightweight, permanent magnet designs
(our prototype is 7 kg) that can be held by an articulating arm with no cryogens or power
consumption. We achieve image encoding and eliminate the heavy, power consuming readout
gradient by using a built-in gradient requiring no additional power and producing no acoustic noise.
We propose passive and active external interference mitigation methods to eliminate the need for a
shielded room. We will validate the scanners ability to monitor for and detect cerebral mass effects in
the ICU."

It has been a tacit assumption that the “split” of visual sensory processing between right vs left visual
hemifields (between the left vs right visual cortex, respectively) is somehow “healed” in higher cortex/
cognition. We now know that is not true, at least not in any straightforward way. Yet visual cognition seems
seamless, not split down the middle. We don’t know how it becomes seamless because neurophysiology
experiments typically study only one hemisphere at a time. Our project uses bilateral multiple-electrode
recordings to test hypotheses about how visual information is coordinated and transferred between cerebral
hemispheres. Monkeys will perform tasks in which information is transferred between hemispheres by gaze
shifts, by a moving object’s trajectory, or in which information is loaded simultaneously into both hemispheres.
Our results will give insights into the neural basis of visual cognition, consciousness, and into cortical
communication in general. This is especially relevant for understanding disorders of interhemispheric
interaction, such as dyslexia and hemispatial neglect."

current and future challenges, opportunities and gaps in kidney care (b) create innovative patient centered
solutions (diagnostics, therapeutics, patient centered tools) for kidney disease patients (c) understand the
importance of a holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to kidney disease innovation that goes all the way from
ideation and investment, to experimental and clinical data, to regulation and reimbursement pathways (while at
the same time addressing the inherent disparities in kidney care) and (d) leverage the current kidney innovation
landscape to develop solutions that actually get to patients so that kidney disease patients will no longer have
to look at the parade of therapies for other diseases and wonder “if not me then who and if not now then when…”
We plan to achieve these goals by (a) creating a pipeline of diverse, multidisciplinary and talented problem
solvers (b) developing a summer kidney immersion program (skills development) (c) forming multi-disciplinary
problem-solving teams (coached by multi-disciplinary mentors) that do research projects to address unmet
clinical needs and (d) nurturing an alumni and retention program for networking and career opportunities
respectively.
In summary, we will create a holistic, patient centered, multi-disciplinary, team-based approach to problem
solving in the kidney technology area, using a robust pipeline of young, innovative and creative trainees. Most
importantly, we plan to invest in mentorship and professional development, that will hopefully keep these trainees
in the kidney technology innovation area; and by doing so transform the way that we will care for patients with
kidney disease in the future."
10883959,"Microglia play both protective and pathogenic roles in neurodegenerative disease but mechanisms that specify
or restrict these opposing activities remain poorly understood. Molecular, cellular, and genetic studies implicate
defects in phagocytosis, lysosomal function and lipid metabolism as contributing to pathological phenotypes. In
line with these findings, the accumulation of lipid droplets is a hallmark of microglia in aging and
neurodegenerative disease states. Due to the essential roles of LXRs and SREBPs in the regulation of cellular
cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, we hypothesize that the formation of lipid droplets is a manifestation of
general defects in the normal homeostatic functions of LXRs and SREBPs that are broadly linked to pathological
microglia phenotypes. Although conventional LXR ligands have been shown to exert protective effects in mouse
models of neurodegeneration, their mechanisms of action have not been established and they cannot be used
clinically because they induce hypertriglyceridemia. Here, we will build on our prior work demonstrating that the
endogenous LXR agonist desmosterol and synthetic desmosterol mimetics mimic normal physiology by
coordinately regulating LXR and SREBP and do not induce hypertriglyceridemia. Three Specific Aims are
proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that age and inflammation-dependent formation of lipid
droplets is regulated by the LXR and SREBP pathways by selectively knocking out LXRs or SREBPs in microglia
and pharmacologically by treating animals with either the conventional LXR agonist GW3965 that selectively
activates LXRs or the desmosterol mimetics that simultaneously activate LXRs and suppress SREBPs. In
Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that coordinate regulation of LXRs and SREBPs in the brain by
desmosterol mimetics reduce the number and/or activity of pathogenic microglia and confer similar or greater
protection against neurodegeneration in the Tau/APOE4 model than the conventional LXR agonist GW3965
without causing hypertriglyceridemia. In Specific Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that LXR and SREBP have
conserved roles in regulating lipid metabolism in human iPSC-derived microglia in vitro and following engraftment
into the brains of immune-deficient humanized mice. Effects of GW3965 and desmosterol mimetics will be
assessed in vitro and in engrafted hosts under homeostatic conditions during aging and in response to LPS
activation. In each Aim, we will investigate the molecular functions of LXRs and SREBPs by determining the
effects of GW3965 and desmosterol mimetics on microglia transcriptomes and epigenetic landscapes and the
genome wide binding patterns of LXRs and SREBPs. Collectively, these studies will advance understanding of
the linkage of lipid droplets with neurodegeneration, provide insights into mechanisms underlying protective
effects of LXR agonists, and potentially open a path towards clinical development of safe and effective LXR
agonists for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disease."
10886543,"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) results in a 56% higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD) in U.S.
Veterans. PD presents clinically with resting tremors, balance problems, gait instability, and locomotor deficits.
Histological hallmarks of PD are spread of alpha synuclein (α-syn) pathology through interconnected brain
regions, and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There is no
cure for PD and treatments are only palliative. With OEF/OIF Veterans entering middle-age, when the diagnosis
of PD becomes more prevalent, it is important to identify factors and events that increase the risk of potentially
developing PD and, more importantly, potential mitigating factors that slow its progression. Exercise has been
shown to prevent age-related brain deterioration and is associated with better white matter fiber integrity
resulting in improved executive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Environmental enrichment
in animals and rehabilitation including physiotherapy in patients, have been shown to significantly improve
recovery and decrease hospital stay in patients with TBI. However, the effectiveness of exercise at preventing
PD during rehabilitation from mTBI is unknown. Genome wide association studies have linked mutations in
Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase-2 to late onset PD that is pathologically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. These
findings suggest that LRRK2 likely also plays a role in non-genetic causes of PD. Recent in vitro and in vivo
studies show that inhibition of kinase activity in WT-LRRK2 or gain-of-function LRRK2 mutants, confers robust
neuroprotection in models of neuroinflammation and PD. To date, all pharmacological treatments aimed at
preventing or stopping PD progression have failed in human clinical trials and this may be due to preclinical
studies that relied primarily on incomplete PD animal models. In spite of best efforts, use of these incomplete
PD models, (e.g. neurotoxin induced lesions in brain areas affected in PD without accompanying α-syn
pathology) has also failed to produce a bonafide biological link between mTBI and PD. This lack of clarity is
likely why no effective rehabilitation methods or treatments to stop or prevent PD currently exist. Injection of
amyloidogenic pre-formed α-syn fibrils (PFF) into the SNpc of rodents causes formation and spread of human-
like α-syn pathology through the interconnected brain regions, progressive and selective dopaminergic
neurodegeneration with PD related behavioral deficits. Using this more complete model of late onset PD, we
plan to determine the connection between mTBI and PD and to test potential treatments that may prevent PD.
Our overall hypothesis is that repetitive mTBI (r-mTBI) promotes PD pathology in vulnerable individuals (i.e.
those with undetected PD), but exercise combined with new pharmacotherapies can delay the progression of
PD, even in vulnerable individuals. We will test our hypothesis in the PFF induced model of PD and test if
exercise along with pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 can prevent PD. With highly specific LRRK2 inhibitors
entering human trials for treating diagnosed PD, it is essential to determine if together with exercise, this class
of drugs can prevent PD in at risk populations. In addition to supporting the scientific objectives, this career
development award will provide Dr. Delic with training in different models of brain injury and behavioral as
well as neurophysiological outcome measures at the VA New Jersey Health Care System. This training will
enable Dr. Delic to successfully translate this and future treatments to the clinic."

Through meaningful collaborations with partnering schools and our “spoke” organization, Marshfield Clinic
Research Institute, we expand support and innovation to accelerate clinical and translational research (CTR)
across our Hub. Over the past funding period, our KL2 scholars have successfully competed for $131M in
extramural funding. Our evidence-based CTR mentorship trained 501 master facilitators in 51 CTSAs. We

10886676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Streptococci are the most abundant microbes in the human oral cavity, with most people harboring multiple
species, and often even multiple strains of the same species (1-6). Further, while most species of oral
streptococci are not pathogenic, studies with selected strains have shown that streptococci can influence the
physical location and the virulence factor expression of oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg),
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (2, 3, 7-11). These interactions
influence the progression and severity of disease, as well as its resistance to treatment (7, 12-16). However,
these interactions also rely are governed by the traits that are known to vary across the genus, such as cell
surface structures and secreted organic acids (17, 18). Further, transcriptional heterogeneity resulting in the
existence of subpopulations, can further alter the behavior of streptococci (19-23). Thus, while the abundant
streptococcal genus is thought of as an important mediator of pathogen behavior, it is not well understood how
streptococcal-pathogen interactions vary across the genomic and transcriptomic diversity of the genus. In this
study, the overarching hypothesis is that genomic, phenotypic, and transcriptional heterogeneity of commensal
streptococci alters interactions with pathogens and impacts infections. This proposal aims to expand our
understanding of streptococcal-pathogen interactions by investigating diversity at two levels: genomic and
transcriptional. First, it proposes to systematically characterize the interactions formed by taxonomically diverse
streptococci with the pathogens Pg and Aa in a phylogenomic framework (Aim 1). This work will identify the scale
at which interactions vary across the streptococcal genus and potentially identify new functions that mediate
interactions with these pathogens. Second, this proposal will characterize the transcriptional heterogeneity in
commensal streptococci that result in subpopulations and ask how subpopulations influence, and are influenced
by, interactions with oral pathogens (Aim 2). This aim will significantly advance our understanding of the role of
transcriptional heterogeneity in oral commensal streptococci, how it varies taxonomically, and how it is altered
by environmental changes. Further, both Aims will consider the interplay of streptococcal diversity and
interactions on spatial patterning at the micron-level. Overall, the proposed research will broaden our
understanding of the role of streptococci during oral disease."
10886265,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Humoral immunity forms the basis for vaccine-induced immune protection. Following infection and vaccination,
a fraction of activated B cells differentiates into long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) or memory B cells to provide
longitudinal protection against pathogens. Whereas LLPCs constitutively produce circulating antibodies,
memory B cells in circulation and tissues are reactivated following antigenic reencounter through rapid
expansion and antibody production. Existing forms of vaccination rely upon generation of neutralizing
antibodies by LLPCs. However, evolving pathogens harboring frequent mutations at sites of immune
recognition might be better targeted by heterogeneous memory B cells, with their broader distribution across
tissues and enhanced cross-reactivity. Understanding these aspects of memory B cells is thus crucial for
leveraging the additional layer of protection offered by the heterogeneous population in vaccine development.
Co-expression of Tbet and CD11c (Tbet+CD11c+) marks a subset of such heterogeneous, antigen-experienced
B cells that arises in aging, infection, and autoimmunity, respectively, termed age-associated, atypical, and
double-negative (in humans, IgD- CD27-) B cells which mediate protection from pathogens in mice and
humans. Their contribution towards protection is likely in part due to their unique localization as a resident
memory B cell subset in tissue, most notably the splenic marginal zone which via its exposure to circulation
provides front-line defense against bloodborne pathogens upon rechallenge. Tbet+CD11c+ B cells also infiltrate
non-lymphoid tissues, including the liver, with residency establishment at non-lymphoid tissue sites positioning
them for early detection of invading pathogens. Confounding their investigation, however, is lack of knowledge
of the relationship between the non-lymphoid and lymphoid populations. Tbet+CD11c+ memory B cells also
contain autoreactive clones and appears to be a major source of autoantibodies, which may be pathogenic.
Although the ability of Tbet+CD11c+ B cells to mount robust antibody responses at tissue sites of infection
makes them an attractive candidate to target in vaccination, we need to understand the relationship between
the lymphoid and non-lymphoid pools, and how the balance between their protective and autoreactive
functions is regulated. Are these cellular sites, and protective and autoreactive functions, a consequence of
two pools of Tbet+CD11c+ B cells? Do cross-reactive Tbet+CD11c+ B cells, recognizing both self and non-self,
rely on environmental signals to mediate protection or pathology? To address these knowledge gaps, in this
revised application, we will identify the mechanism by which Tbet+CD11c+ B cells infiltrate non-lymphoid organs
and determine if they maintained therein and elucidate the nature of their autoreactivity. Both goals fit the R21
Exploratory/ Developmental Grant mechanism. We are at “early and conceptual stage(s) . . . of the
development of novel applications that could have a major impact” on our understanding or tissue protection
provided by heterogeneous B cells and how they may be safely targeted for vaccine development."
10924026,"The demise of pancreatic islet insulin-secreting β cells in diabetes has a neuronal component. Therefore, understanding the biology underlying the neuronal control of islet β cells will unravel information that can be leveraged to develop neuromodulation-based methods to enhance functional β-cell mass in individuals with diabetes. The pancreas receives a generous supply of efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons and afferent sensory neurons. While the effect of efferent neurons in islet β cells is well documented, the role of sensory neurons is largely unknown. The pancreatic sensory neurons emanate from the vagal and thoracic spinal nerves with cell bodies lying in the nodose ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), respectively. Using chemical and surgical denervation models, we demonstrated that ablation of a subset of DRG pancreas-projecting sensory neurons enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose excursion – in a sex-dependent manner – without alterations in insulin sensitivity, body composition and energy expenditure. These data prompted us to determine the molecular foundation of the crosstalk between sensory neurons and pancreatic β cells under normal and metabolically challenged conditions. First, we will use live-cell imaging of intracellular calcium influx, proteomics and in vitro co-culture systems to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the sensory neuron-islet crosstalk. We will use in vitro and in vivo models to interrogate the significance of the neuro-islet intercommunication in the well-known sex difference in glucose homeostasis. Second, we will use high-throughput RNA deep sequencing approach to identify vagal and spinal sensory-derived neuropeptides and growth factors modulating adaptive β-cell expansion and activity in insulin-resistant states. High-resolution imaging modality (PanCLARITY) will be used to map with accuracy the interactions between pancreatic β cells and the newly identified sensory neuronal markers. Finally, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to define the role and mechanism of action of novel sensory-derived signaling molecules in proliferation and function of mouse and human β cells. Together, these studies will unravel the molecular foundation of the unique interactions between afferent neurons and islet β cells and will provide high-value biological data to design neuropharmacology- and neuromodulation-based strategies to enhance functional β-cell mass in patients with diabetes."

noncoding RNAs, like microRNAs and circular RNAs, are resistant to the known pathways that destroy protein-
coding RNAs. Here I present my plan to identify how these two types of noncoding RNA are destroyed.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are protected from degradation by their effector protein Argonaute. One way to degrade
miRNAs is through target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD), which occurs when a highly complementary
viral or artificial RNA interacts with the miRNA. My postdoctoral work identified two of the first examples of
endogenous targets that induce miRNA degradation, which also led to our discovery of an E3 ubiquitin ligase
that mediates TDMD and the identification of 48 additional miRNAs (likely an underestimate) subject to TDMD.
Our working model now is that the binding of highly complementary targets to the Argonaute–miRNA complex
leads to recruitment of the E3 ligase, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of Argonaute, and release and
degradation of the miRNA. With the discovery of TDMD effector proteins and the broad influence of TDMD on
miRNA stability, a major gap is identifying the target RNAs that induce TDMD. A related problem is understanding
why some targets are better than others. We will address these gaps by answering two questions: 1) Which
endogenous RNAs induce miRNA degradation? 2) What are the pairing rules and cis-acting elements that
promote TDMD? To do so, we will use transgenic mice, engineered cell lines, genome-wide approaches, and
classic molecular biology techniques. Our second area of research is understanding how circular RNAs
(circRNA) are degraded. The poster child of post-transcriptional circRNA regulation is Cdr1as, a conserved
circRNA that is highly expressed in neurons and limits spontaneous synaptic vesicle release. Cdr1as contains a
single near-perfect binding site that can be sliced by Ago2-loaded miR-671 and >70 seed sites for miR-7.
Previously, I showed that Cdr1as can be regulated by the independent and cooperative actions of miR-671 and
miR-7. How miR-7 induces destruction of Cdr1as is unclear as circRNAs should be resistant to miRNA-mediated
deadenylation and decapping. Here, we will answer two questions: 1) How is Cdr1as degraded? 2) How are
other unstable circRNAs degraded? The outcomes of our research will be the identification and improved
understanding of dedicated pathways for degrading noncoding RNAs. These pathways have potential for broad
impact as they are likely employed in diverse cell types and organisms and in response to a variety of stimuli."
10887022,"The lipid peroxidation byproduct acrolein (systematic name: propenal), is a highly toxic aldehyde that exerts
strong toxic effects by covalently binding to surrounding macromolecules, such as proteins, RNA, DNA, and
lipids. Due to the toxicity, cellular mechanisms evolved to detoxify acrolein by quenching acrolein and turning it
into a non-toxic compound. In the CNS, acrolein is quenched by carnosine. Carnosine is generated by the
enzyme Carnosine synthase 1 (Carns1). Aging is associate with reduced levels of carnosine in the brain.
Restoring carnosine levels through food supplementation with carnosine restores the age-related reduction in
brain activity in both mouse models and human patients. Elevated levels of the toxicant acrolein were found in
the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients at the preclinical stage, suggesting that lack of acrolein de-
toxification by carnosine contributes to the pathogenesis at early stages of the disease. Nevertheless, the role
carnosine-mediated detoxification in AD disease etiology is unknown, partially due to lack of appropriate
experimental models. In this proposal we will develop genetic mouse models that will enable us to reduce the
levels of carnosine specifically in the CNS, to explore the role of carnosine in aging and in AD etiology.
In our preliminary studies, we found that the enzyme Carns1 is expressed in the CNS solely by mature
oligodendrocytes. Although carnosine is a ubiquitous metabolite in the body, we found that oligodendrocyte-
specific ablation of Carns1 dramatically reduces the level of carnosine in the CNS, suggesting that
oligodendrocytes are the sole source of carnosine in the CNS. We also found that oligodendrocyte-derived
carnosine protects the CNS from inflammation and reduces the spread of damaged areas marked by acrolein
adducts. In this proposal we hypothesize that oligodendrocyte-derived carnosine play a fundamental role in
acrolein accumulation in the CNS of aged and AD patients.
We will develop new genetic tools to explore the link between oligodendrocytes-derived carnosine, aging, and
AD. In the first aim we will develop Carns1 conditional allele that will enable us to reduce carnosine levels
specifically in the CNS. In the second aim we will explore the role of oligodendrocyte-derived carnosine in disease
progression in two mouse models of amyloid pathology."

Candidate: Jasleen Minhas, MD is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist passionate about developing
personalized interventions promoting physical activity to improve patient outcomes in PAH. She seeks didactic
and experiential training to develop expertise in advanced statistical methods for multidimensional data,
longitudinal data analysis, and qualitative methods to advance her career goals towards research independence.
Research Context: Activity limitation is an early manifestation of PAH and often persists despite treatment.
Patients with PAH prioritize the impact of disease on their daily physical activity over its effect on exercise
capacity. However, PAH care focuses on improving exercise capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk test.
Clinic-based tests do not capture the daily variability in functionality. This proposal uses a non-invasive biosensor
device that continuously captures multiple data streams (including ECG, respiratory rate, and activity) to define
the clinical implications of continuously measured cardiopulmonary measures and physical activity in the patient’s
home environment. Additionally, we will assess patient’s attitudes and preferences toward behavioral
interventions targeting physical activity.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify determinants of patterns of heart rate and daily physical activity in PAH. 2) Phenotype
patients by integrating cardiopulmonary and physical activity measures and determine the association of
phenotypes with clinical outcomes. 3) Assess patient attitudes and preferences for activity-based interventions.
Research Plan: Dr. Minhas will utilize data from the ACTiPH-VP study to accomplish these aims. She will
identify predominant patterns of heart rate and physical activity using a multilevel functional principal component
analysis and identify their determinants. She will then integrate cardiopulmonary measures with physical activity
and utilize the Joint and Individual Variance explained method to identify novel phenotypes and investigate their
association with clinical outcomes. For Aim 3, Dr. Minhas will use semi-structured interviews to assess patient
attitudes towards physical activity, and their preferences for activity-based interventions.
Career Development Plan: Working closely with her mentors and advisors, Dr. Minhas’s goals are to 1) expand
expertise in advanced statistical methods and dimensionality reduction techniques for multidimensional data
gathered by biosensor devices; 2) obtain skills to design, launch, monitor and troubleshoot a multisite,
prospective study; and 3) gain proficiency in qualitative methods to elicit patient preferences. Additionally, she will
remain heavily involved with the parent ACTiPH study, gaining skills in startup, oversight, and completion of a
multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with PAH across the US.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania offers an ideal environment to pursue this training, with well-
established mentors. Her division is heavily invested in Dr. Minhas’s success."

Mobile element insertions (MEIs) are a diverse and poorly understood source of genetic variation in humans.
These insertions occur when retrotransposons integrate into the genome. Recent advancements in genomics
technologies in large populations have revealed over 100,000 polymorphic MEIs, making them a very prevalent
class of genetic variation. MEIs have been shown to significantly impact gene function and contribute to human
diseases. In many cases, specific noncoding MEIs have been linked to neurologic disease. In particular, my
training lab has discovered that the cause of the neurodegenerative disease X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism is
an intronic insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) element, which causes a distinct expression and alternative
splicing signature. However, our understanding of the broader effects of MEIs on gene regulation, particularly
alternative splicing, remains limited. This fellowship aims to leverage large-scale genetic datasets and cutting-
edge analytical methods to characterize MEIs, explore their functional implications for gene expression and
splicing, and investigate their association with neurological diseases. I will also specifically dissect the role of
SVA elements, which are hominid specific and display unique patterns of internal variation. I will assemble a
dataset of over 2000 matched short-read whole genome sequencing and bulk RNA-seq data, including multi-
tissue expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and brain sequencing data from the
CommonMind Consortium, which includes neuropsychiatric cases and controls. Using this data, I will look at
broad patterns of transcriptomic effects from MEIs (Aim 1) and identify specific MEIs associated with splicing
changes in the brain (Aim 2). Finally, I will perform MEI discovery in long-read whole genome sequencing data
from 10,000 individuals from the NIH All of Us initiative. I will harness this large dataset to comprehensively
characterize MEIs and identify SVA elements associated with neurological disease (Aim 3). In parallel with these
research aims, an exceptional team of mentors and advisors across multiple disciplines, career stages, and
institutions will provide didactic training, hands-on research support, regular opportunities for presentation in
seminars and conferences, and a variety of soft skill development sessions that directly align with my career
objectives during my PhD training. Collectively, the aims outlined in this proposal will take advantage of unique
tools and resources to yield novel insights into mobile element insertions and their relationship to neurological
disease and will serve as an outstanding training opportunity for me in computational, statistical, and functional
disease genomics."

 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for ~75% of kidney cancers and is the 8th leading
cause of cancer death in the United States. In addition to near ubiquitous loss of VHL, the landscape of ccRCC
is dominated by mutations in epigenetic regulators SETD2, PBRM1, and BAP1. The epigenome is profoundly
disrupted in ccRCC with defects in epigenetic marks on DNA, RNA, and histones, culminating in aberrant gene
expression. Mutations in the SETD2 histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylase occur in ~25% of primary ccRCC but
increase to >60% in ccRCC metastases. Completion of TCGA enabled identification of actionable mutations in
virtually every solid tumor and those profiles now drive treatment decisions. One major exception, however, is
RCC, where the current standard of care, checkpoint inhibitor and anti-VEGF therapy, does not account for
~50% of RCCs having mutations in chromatin regulators like SETD2. Many ccRCCs display heterogeneous
and subclonal intratumor SETD2 mutations, but we do not understand how SETD2 loss deregulates cell
growth and what pathways it works through. After first-line therapy, response rates are 20%, highlighting the
need to understand and target drivers of metastasis like SETD2. A recent novel finding linked SETD2 activity
to the targeting of N6-methyladenosine in mRNA, a key mechanism for controlling many RNA metabolic
processes, which has also been shown to be deregulated in cancer and contribute to metastatic processes.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that SETD2 loss leads to large-scale re-localization of m6A and an
enhanced sensitivity to an m6A inhibitor that is entering clinical trials. This SETD2-m6A link has not been
explored in a ccRCC context but could represent a novel SETD2 effector mechanism and drug target in
ccRCC. We explore this relationship for the first time with this pilot R21 study, making it directly relevant to
NOT-CA-23-060, RNA Modifications in Cancer Biology. Our proposal is significant because ~30% of patients
diagnosed with clinically localized RCC experience metastatic progression, and once metastatic disease
develops only ~7% survive >5 years. Our central hypothesis is that loss of SETD2 drives aggressive ccRCC in
part through deregulated m6A targeting that promotes a pro-metastatic expression program. Our proposal is
expected to develop relevant ccRCC cell line models and define the links between SETD2/H3K36me3 and
METTL3/m6A in ccRCC through the following specific aims. In aim 1, we will map H3K36me3, m6A, METTL3,
and expression patterns using RIP-/ChIP-/RNA-seq in novel SETD2 isogenic renal cell line models. In aim 2,
we will perform integrative analysis of omics data to uncover genes/pathways impacted by SETD2 loss in an
m6A-dependent manner. Finally, in aim 3 we will genetically and pharmacologically modulate m6A in SETD2
isogenic cell lines and define cancer-relevant cellular growth phenotypes. This work is expected to positively
affect human health by yielding a new understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of SETD2 driven cell
growth deregulation and uncovering new ways to therapeutically target this mutation."

Photoreceptor cells in the retina are highly polarized and compartmentalized neurons. Most proteins
localize to a specific compartment in photoreceptors, and such compartment-specific protein localization
is essential for the proper function and survival of photoreceptors. Despite considerable research efforts,
however, our understanding of the mechanisms by which photoreceptors achieve compartment-specific
protein localization is limited. Related to this, the pathophysiology of retinal degenerations caused by the
disruption of these mechanisms is also not sufficiently understood. This is partly because of the lack of
easy-to-use means to monitor protein trafficking and confinement in diseased photoreceptors. To address
this need, we have developed two transgenic mouse lines, iROSRePT (inducible Reporter for the Outer
Segment Renewal and Protein Trafficking) and iRATProx (inducible Reporter for ABCA4 Trafficking and
Proximity labeling). In the proposed studies, we will utilize these reporter lines and four disease models
representing the disruption of the ciliary gate, intraflagellar transport (IFT), and exocytotic membrane fusion
machinery and investigate the precise requirements of these mechanisms for the compartmentalized
protein localization in photoreceptors. We anticipate that the outcome of this study will significantly advance
our understanding of the mechanisms by which photoreceptor compartment homeostasis is attained and
the pathophysiology of retinal degenerations linked to defective protein trafficking and confinement. This
knowledge will build a foundation to develop treatments for cilia-related retinal degenerations and assess
the efficacy of newly developed therapies."

Currently, clinically used drug abuse medications exist for treatment of addiction to opiates, alcohol, and nicotine,
but not psychostimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine (METH). PPL-138 is a non-selective opioid
receptor ligand with partial agonist activity at NOP and mu receptors, and antagonist activity at kappa and delta.
This compound, initially synthesized by Drs. Lawrence Toll and Stephen Husbands in a NIDA funded effort, has
now been licensed by Phoenix PharmaLabs (PPL), where Dr. Toll is a founder. This compound has been
demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of both cocaine and METH self-administration and reinstatement in rats,
and to be not self-administered in rats or NHPs. Additional pharmacokinetic and safety studies in rodents and
NHPs have demonstrated little to no effect on respiration, constipation, heart rate or blood pressure, up to high
doses, thereby demonstrating a large apparent therapeutic window. It is our hypothesis that the increase in NOP
receptor affinity and activity, compared to buprenorphine, renders PPL-138 less rewarding and better at blocking
drug reward than buprenorphine, a compound demonstrated to reduce craving for psychostimulants. In this
proposed project, PPL will focus on cocaine use disorder (CUD) with an eye on continuing to METH use disorder
(MUD), in the future. To develop PPL-138, PPL has put together an experienced team with expertise in
pharmacology, chemical manufacturing, IND-enabling preclinical studies, regulatory, and first in human studies
and plan to take PPL-138 through each step, culminating in Phase I clinical trials. To accomplish these goals,
experiments have been designed to encompass the following 5 aims. Specific Aim 1 studies performed at Wake
Forest University will conduct final efficacy studies to determine whether PPL-138 is as effective in reducing
cocaine self-administration and relapse in NHPs as it is in rats. Specific Aim 2, will be continue chemical
manufacturing and encompass manufacturing process development and optimization, formulation, and GMP
drug product development and manufacturing. Specific Aim 3 directed by drug discovery and toxicology
consultants and performed primarily at Charles River Laboratories, will include a complete program of IND-
enabling in vitro and in vivo GLP toxicology studies, as well as supporting ADME studies. These will build upon
studies already completed by the previous licensee of this compound and current studies funded by PPL.
Specific Aim 4 will be directed by ICON and devoted to development of regulatory processes and filing an IND.
Finally, Specific Aim 5 will encompass first in human studies, directed by Dr. Frances Levin and run by ICON,
with Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) studies followed by a Single Dose
Crossover study in human volunteers. With the team of experts developing a very safe compound with a novel
mechanism of action, we expect to determine in humans whether a NOP/mu partial agonist can safely and
effectively reduce psychostimulant abuse. Importantly, PPL is committed to providing considerable financial
support for this project to make this in the spirit of a Public/Private Partnership, as specified in the proposal."
10888367,"Project Summary
This project will clarify the value and impact of policy options intended to reduce the population harms of
tobacco. The rise in popularity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes poses both
opportunities and challenges for reducing the population harms of tobacco. ENDS might reduce population
harm if substituted for a significant proportion of combustible cigarettes (c-cigs), but such benefits must be
weighed against the fact that ENDS pose a risk to individuals who, in their absence, would not use tobacco.
Simulation studies can and have been used to assess the trade-offs associated with ENDS. To date, effects
have been simulated in the context of tobacco control policy that was in place at the time the model was built
and reflect the average of state policies in place. Yet, the effects of ENDS may vary according to the intensity
of the tobacco control policies in place. For the proposed study, we define intensified tobacco control policies
(I-TCP) as evidence-based policies that primarily target c-cig use and are capable of substantially reducing the
population harms from tobacco when scaled to levels recommended by public health agencies, i.e., c-cig
taxes, increased tobacco control expenditures that fund comprehensive tobacco control programs, and
comprehensive indoor smoking bans. Because I-TCP can substantially reduce the population harms of
tobacco, the potential for ENDS to further reduce these harms may be attenuated when I-TCP are in effect.
Moreover, our current knowledge of the health and economic impact of I-TCP was, for the most part, amassed
during a time when ENDs did not exist. If the presence of ENDS in the marketplace leads to substitution of less
harmful forms of nicotine (such as ENDS) for more toxic combustible products, then, given the widespread
availability of ENDS, I-TCPs may not lower population health and economic harms of tobacco as much as
available estimates indicate. I-TCP may also influence use patterns of ENDS, creating dynamics that could
lead to unanticipated levels of health impact for both ENDS and I-TCP. Thus, the introduction of ENDS to the
marketplace has created gaps in our knowledge of policy effects, which could precipitate policy missteps that
increase, not decrease, population level tobacco harm. The intertwined effects of tobacco products and
policies cannot meaningfully be explored through any real-world experiment. Therefore, we will conduct a
simulation study to close these knowledge gaps. Although no state is implementing all tobacco policies at
recommended levels, existing variation in state policies can be exploited to reveal the likely impact of individual
state policies. Leveraging existing data sets that capture variation in state policy timing and intensity, we will
build a simulation model to estimate the combined effects of policies and ENDS. Model simulations will
produce both national- and state-level estimates to inform policy aimed at reducing tobacco population harms,
while accounting for: the effects of ENDS in the presence or absence of I-TCP, and the effects of I-TCP in the
presence or absence of ENDS. The results will clarify the plausible range of impacts of both ENDS and I-TCP."

Beyond nutrient absorption, the gastrointestinal tract has wide-ranging effects on the normal and
diseased physiologies of other organ systems, including metabolism, neural function, and the
immune system. A high-resolution, multi-modal 3D map of the bowel would be an invaluable
resource to understand normal bowel function and the perturbations that lead to disease. Our
continued goal is to create this map along the length of the small bowel and colon, both of which
have nuanced geographic specializations of function. Using single-nuclei RNA+ATAC-seq, we
will simultaneously profile the gene expression and regulatory programs that define the complex
cell populations that drive bowel function. We will use the CODEX multiplex immunoassay to
define the spatial relationships of these cell populations and to create 3D maps using serial
sections. We will also use the Molecular Cartography multiplex FISH assay to generate
transcript spatial maps to better integrate the single-nuclei data to the CODEX immuno-maps.
These investigations will be performed on tissues that are preserved and procured in a manner
suitable for high-quality molecular map generation. Our target milestone is to characterize six
bowel sites from a total of 8 demographically-diverse individuals at full coverage. To generate
deeper coverage maps in more individuals, two bowel sites will be mapped at light coverage in
20 individuals."
10886077,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core
The Administrative (Admin) Core of the proposed P50 encompasses an established, generative infrastructure
that will: (a) support efficient implementation of innovative Center research projects and pilot studies; (b)
facilitate synergistic relations among investigators, projects, and pilot studies; (c) provide a national resource
for drug use researchers and prevention scientists as well as prevention providers in local communities. With
more than a decade of experience operating an NIH Center of Excellence (P30DA027827), we have
established a set of efficient procedures and protocols for coordinating innovative transdisciplinary research
among investigators, laboratories, and institutions affiliated with our Center. Our approach to Center
administration is designed to maximize productivity of investigators and Center resources while also minimizing
the administrative burden on Center scientists. The Admin will coordinate and integrate activities across the
Center’s infrastructure that is composed of three Research Projects, a Research Support Core, and a Pilot
Core. The Admin will continue our interinstitutional transdisciplinary work group system that provides a
cohesive intellectual framework for scientific progress and organizes the relationships and interests of
investigators in a manner that encourages collaboration and resource sharing, rather than competition. This
system also is ideal for mentoring early-career investigators and assisting experienced researchers who are
developing new expertise. The Admin also will oversee a vigorous program of outreach and assist the Pilot
Core in the training of the next generation of prevention researchers. Specific aims of the Admin are to (1)
coordinate and provide support for all Center infrastructure components–including three research projects, a
research support core, and a pilot core–to promote synergy and efficiency; (2) foster innovation and
productivity among Center scientists by: (a) continuing a transdisciplinary work group system designed to
generate novel hypotheses and test next generation conceptual models, and (b) facilitating communication
among Center investigators, research project directors, and core directors; (3) oversee administration of
Center-wide budgets and operations to ensure fiscally responsible and strategic allocation of funds; (4) support
a national outreach program to disseminate Center findings to scientists, prevention providers, and the general
public; and (5) evaluate CTAPS’ scientific progress and administrative efficiency."
10886079,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Support Core
We propose a Research Support Core (RSC) in the context of a P50 Research Center of Excellence: The
Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS). The RSC’s overarching goal is to facilitate a new
generation of research focused on (a) stress-induced alterations in brain-immune signaling that create
vulnerabilities to substance misuse and cardiometabolic disease, (b) the identification of malleable protective
processes that can prevent or mitigate the downstream health consequences of stress, and (c) the
development of interventions for African Americans that prevent substance misuse and cardiometabolic
disease. To this end, the Research Support Core (RSC) will: (a) oversee and execute analyses of
neurocognitive, inflammatory, cardiometabolic, and biostatistical data collected by Center Research Projects
(RPs) and Pilot Studies; (b) provide intellectual consultation to Center scientists regarding design protocols,
promising targets for research and intervention, and interpretation of results; and (c) sponsor educational and
training experiences for CTAPS scientists and the broader scientific community. This Core represents a
continuation of a highly productive collaboration between scientists at the University of Georgia and
Northwestern University, who together have established pipelines for generating inflammatory,
cardiometabolic, and neuroimaging data relevant to African Americans’ substance use and overall health. The
RSC comprises substantial intellectual capital and state-of-the science facilities for analysis of neuroimaging
data and assaying biomarkers of inflammatory and cardiometabolic functioning. It is composed of three
subscores: Neurocognitive (NCO), Inflammatory (INF), and Biostatistical (BSC). The RSC’s aims are to: (1)
provide intellectual consultation to RP directors, transdisciplinary work groups, and pilot project investigators,
(2) help develop protocols for collecting high-quality neuroimaging, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic data, (3)
assay biospecimens for inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers, (4) process and analyze data collected
in neuroimaging paradigms, and (5) provide educational experiences to CTAPS scientists, mentees, and
affiliates, as well as serving as a resource for the scientific community by providing education through online
seminars and preconference workshops."
10886080,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pilot Core
The Pilot Core of the proposed P50 supports the vitality of the Center by facilitating investigator development
and promoting new research insights and priorities for the Center’s research studies. This program will provide
a funding mechanism for pilot project applications from early career investigators (ECIs) and from established
investigators seeking to extend their research into assessment of neural and inflammatory mediators of drug
use and cardiometabolic health. Investigators can access seed grant funding and Center resources to (a)
assess the feasibility of exploring a new research question, (b) apply a new approach, or (c) use existing
methodology to explore a novel way to advance a new area of scientific exploration. The seed grant program
also will provide resources to support secondary data analysis of CTAPS datasets from concluded and
ongoing projects. These datasets were collected through both longitudinal, observational research and
randomized prevention trials. Our datasets will permit replication of findings, comparison of models for different
age groups (e.g., adolescents versus young adults), and aggregation of variables across data sets
(harmonization) to maximize sample size or the age span to be evaluated. In addition to the investigator career
development that occurs via seed grant funding, we propose to implement a targeted mentoring program for
ECIs. Although not limited to minority or African American ECIs, an expressed goal of this program is to recruit
early-career scientists from underrepresented backgrounds at UGA and our P50 partner, Northwestern
University (NWU). This program is informed by CTAPS investigators’ experience with mentoring in the P30, a
history of systematic mentoring for junior faculty, mentoring via diversity supplements, and implementing an
Institutional Research Training Grant. To initiate the Year 1 (Y1) pilot project and mentoring system, we
designed a unique pilot that will serve as a collaborative training experience for the Y1 mentoring cohort and
advance the scientific aims of the Center. This experience centers around a secondary data analysis of fMRI,
inflammation, and psychosocial data collected during the past CTAPS P30 grant period. The training cohort will
work with this unique, rich data set under the guidance of Dr. Brody, the Center Director, with methodological
and substantive support from P50 scientists and statisticians. The aims of our Pilot Core are to: (1) administer
a seed grant program designed to support pilot projects that address African Americans’ drug use and
cardiometabolic vulnerabilities; (2) provide targeted mentoring to early-career investigators, particularly those
from underrepresented groups; and (3) implement a unique Year 1 pilot project/training experience: “Racial
discrimination, protective processes, and drug use among African Americans: The role of NIN mechanisms.”"
10886083,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Project 1
The University of Georgia’s (UGA) Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS; P20 MH068666,
P30 DA027827) has been funded continuously since 2003 to advance next-generation basic and preventive
investigations of risk, resilience, and drug use among African American young people living in resource poor
communities. The CTAPS P50 proposal is based on the hypothesis that progress in the prevention of drug
abuse and cardiometabolic disease among African Americans requires consideration of the processes through
which chronic, multigenerational poverty and social adversity become embedded in biological and behavioral
systems in ways that confer heightened vulnerability to addictive behaviors. Conceptually, the Center’s
research program is grounded in a neuroimmune network (NIN) model authored by Center scientists that
highlights bidirectional signaling between the brain and immune system in the pathophysiology of addictive
behaviors. The NIN model proposes that chronic stressors amplify crosstalk between peripheral inflammation
and neural circuitries subserving emotion generation and regulation. This crosstalk results in chronic low-grade
inflammation, which upon accessing the brain, accentuates threat processing in cortico-amygdala circuity,
attenuates reward processing in cortico-striatal circuity, and dampens prefrontal executive control. NIN
dysregulation is hypothesized to predispose individuals to substance misuse and high fat diets, in part, to self-
medicate the negative emotions associated with disrupted neural signaling. These behaviors generate
additional inflammation, as well as neuroadaptive changes in reward circuitry, further elevating risk for
substance misuse. In Research Project (RP) 1, we propose one of the first prospective studies to test NIN
predictions from a sample of 225 African American youth. Participants will be ages 18-19 at study enrollment, a
period of time in which substance use and unhealthy eating rapidly escalate among African Americans. At
Time 1 (T1) and T2 (2.5 years later), participants will complete a blood draw to quantify low-grade
inflammation, fMRI scanning of threat-, reward-, and executive control neural activity, and assessments of
stress exposure, addictive behaviors, and cardiometabolic risk. RP1 integrates research on multiple organ
systems (i.e., brain and immune system) to advance the science of risk and resilience for addictive behaviors
and their cardiometabolic health consequences, especially among low income African American communities
and other US populations exposed to chronic stress."
10884837,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The brain’s lymphatic system is composed of glia-lymphatic (glymphatic) and meningeal lymphatic branches.
The glymphatic branch, which is located in the brain parenchyma, transports cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via
perivascular spaces (PVS) to clear neurotoxic molecules. It functionally connects with the brain’s surface-located
meningeal lymphatic vasculature for CSF drainage. While brain lymphatic impairment has recently been linked
with neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and craniosynostosis, the
regulatory mechanisms for brain lymphatic rejuvenation are largely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to
establish mechanisms rejuvenating brain lymphatics and exploit brain lymphatic activation as a new therapeutic
strategy for craniosynostosis and AD. The scientific premise is based on our recently published (Cell, 2021,
PMID: 33417861) and unpublished data (Cell Stem Cell 2023 in revision). Specifically, we established the first
animal model (Twist1+/-) of neurological defects in craniosynostosis and identified meningeal lymphatic vessel
(mLV) defect as a key driving factor for these cognitive defects. We also developed a mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC)-based suture regeneration approach. Using this approach, we successfully rescued neurological defects
by rejuvenating brain lymphatic functions in Twist1+/- mice, the well-established model for Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome with craniosynostosis. Our discovery of brain lymphatic rejuvenation in regeneration craniosynostosis
mice affords not only a new therapeutic strategy for treating craniosynostosis, it also provides a unique animal
model to investigate regulatory mechanisms underlying brain lymphatic rejuvenation. Preliminary data guide us
to hypothesize that MSC-LEC (lymphatic endothelial cell) crosstalk and the remodeling of AQP4 (glymphatic
system mediator) in regeneration craniosynostosis mice drive brain lymphatic rejuvenation, which can be
exploited to mitigate craniosynostosis and AD. Overall, building upon our published discoveries, the completion
of proposed studies will advance the field by developing stem cell-mediated treatments of craniosynostosis, filling
in missing mechanistic knowledge of meningeal lymphatic rejuvenation, and validating VEGF-C/AQP4 as
potential therapeutic targets for craniosynostosis and AD."

Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes in the innate immune system. They destroy transformed
and pathogen-infected cells mainly through secreting the contents of membrane-enclosed cytolytic
granules, secretory lysosomes containing the pore-forming protein perforin and the serine proteases
granzymes. When a NK cell recognizes its target cell, the contact area between the NK cell and the
target cell forms a highly organized structure known as the immunological synapse. Cytolytic granules
then migrate toward the immunological synapse, where they fuse with the plasma membrane to release
their cytolytic molecules, a process known as cytolytic granule exocytosis. Once released from the NK
cell, cytolytic molecules enter the target cell and trigger cell death. Imbalances in cytolytic molecule
exocytosis cause major forms of human disorder such as immunodeficiency and chronic pathogen
infection. The molecular basis of cytolytic granule exocytosis in NK cells is still poorly understood. The
proposed research aims to bridge this knowledge gap. In our preliminary studies, we established an
assay to quantify cytolytic granule exocytosis in a physiologically relevant NK-like cell line. Furthermore,
we developed new platforms to genetically dissect complex exocytic pathways in mammalian cells using
unbiased CRISPR screens. In this research, we will take strategic advantage of these assays to dissect
cytolytic molecule exocytosis in NK cells using a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Next, we will validate
the candidate genes identified in the screen using a pooled secondary screen. Finally, we will validate
selected candidate genes using individual gene knockout. If successfully accomplished, this proposed
research will offer the first genome-scale view of the cytolytic exocytic pathway and will significantly
broaden our knowledge of NK cell functions. Insights acquired from this work will facilitate the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune diseases caused by defective cytolytic granule
exocytosis."
10888520,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
When the future has little value, impulsive choices abound. Steeply discounting the future means a drug-high
now is more valuable than future health, wealth and relationships. A large and robust literature reveals that
steeply discounting the future is correlated with early substance use, substance-use disorders, and poor
outcomes in drug-treatment trials. A small literature suggests that reducing delay discounting improves clinical
outcomes in humans. Such findings have motivated nonhuman research seeking to discover interventions that
can reduce impulsive decision-making. Those interventions might be adapted to prevention programs designed
to reduce childhood impulsivity and adolescent substance use. A practical limitation of the effective nonhuman
interventions (some of them conducted in our lab) is their duration (median = 123 operant-training sessions). In
preliminary studies, we have obtained comparable reductions in rats' impulsive choice in a fraction of the time
by using Pavlovian training methods. When Pavlovian training is complete (8 sessions), the newly established
conditioned stimulus (CS) may be used as an antecedent to attract the rat toward the self-control choice; this
significantly reduces impulsivity. The CS may also be used as a conditioned-reinforcing consequence that
significantly increases future self-control choices. These practical interventions and clinically relevant
improvements have obvious translational potential. Before undertaking that translational research, however, we
propose two experiments designed to explore how parametrically manipulating training variables known to
influence Pavlovian learning impacts the efficacy of these CS-as-antecedent and CS-as-consequence
interventions. The knowledge gained from this project will provide a roadmap to guide the design of Pavlovian
interventions seeking to prevent impulsive decision-making, and prevent the health deficits associated with those
choices."

Alaska Native (AN) people have the highest recorded rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world with twofold
higher incidence and mortality than US whites. This cancer disparity has persisted for over 30 years despite an
increase in AN CRC screening rates to levels similar to non-AN. A holistic approach to reducing CRC that
includes both primary and secondary prevention is vital. Yet, no epidemiological or cohort studies exist to
explain the increased risk of AN CRC. This will be the first cohort study to investigate the etiology of CRC
among AN people with the goal of identifying new risk factors with translational potential for primary prevention
and risk prediction. Additionally, as CRC risk is increasing among typically low-risk groups across the U.S.,
such as the young, understanding the causes of this disease in a population that has seen dramatic increases
in cancer risk over the past century may be more broadly informative. Led by the Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium (ANTHC), in partnership with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC), this proposed research
will establish the first community-engaged cohort study of CRC risk among AN people. Building on our
successful pilot recruitment study, in Aim 1, we will enroll 1,000 individuals prior to colonoscopy screening in
Anchorage and three-four regional Tribal hospitals outside of Anchorage. The ultimate outcome of interest for
this study will include both incident CRC and advanced adenoma (adenomatous polyp ≥1 cm or containing
>25% villous component or high-grade dysplasia, or sessile serrated adenoma/polyp ≥1 cm). We will collect
exposome data using culturally appropriate and previously validated questionnaires on demographics, diet and
traditional food use, food storage and processing, medications, occupation, lifetime environmental exposures
and tobacco use. We will also collect medical history, including lifetime antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors,
and anthropometric information, as well as objective measures of physical activity and sleep, including
circadian rhythms. In Aim 2, we will collect biospecimens (tumor tissue, colon biopsies, saliva, hair, urine, and
blood), and biobank the samples as a resource for future work. Importantly, we already have IRB and Tribal
approval for future biospecimen testing including microbiome and epigenetics analyses. For Specific Aim 3, we
will conduct statistical analyses of these questionnaire, anthropometric, biomarker, and medical record data to
assess associations of risk factors with CRC. This study utilizes a community-based participatory research
approach to address a key health disparity of community concern. By establishing an AN cohort with unique
risk exposures we will gain a better understanding of CRC among this high risk population. This research will
provide critical information that can be used to inform future research, develop risk prediction models, and
design effective primary prevention strategies among AN people and other populations at high or increasing
risk of this disease."
10895298,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are now hundreds of thousands of people enrolled in biobank studies, with
genome-wide genotypes and rich phenotype data recorded. These data are an
unprecedented resource for learning about human genetic and phenotypic variation. At
the same time, population geneticists are developing advanced tools for representing
large genetic datasets as ancestral recombination graphs, which concisely encode the
genealogical relationships among genomic segments from different people in the
dataset. Combining biobank-scale data with these advanced computational tools
presents a tremendous opportunity, but we need new statistical methods to realize the
possible benefits. My research group will develop and apply such statistical methods to
complex biomedical traits, drawing on expertise in population-genetic theory, statistical
genetics, and computation. First, we will leverage our new methods and large public
datasets to study the evolution of genetic variants associated with biomedically relevant
traits, providing important clues about disease etiology. Ancestral recombination graphs
can encode all historical information available in a sample of contemporary genomes,
so they are a rich basis for evolutionary inference. Second, we will also develop
methods for enhancing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at discovering
trait-associated genetic variants. Many key GWAS goals that remain challenging
today—adjustment for population stratification and assortative mating, fine mapping of
causal variants, and others—hinge critically on parsing correlations among both
neighboring and distant genetic loci. Ancestral recombination graphs represent such
correlations naturally, and so emerging tools present a variety of novel possibilities for
clarifying the genetic basis of trait variation, including heritable differences in disease
susceptibility. Finally, a third leg of our research program will be aimed at protecting the
privacy of participants in large genetic databases. The assembly of large genetic
datasets is critical to biomedical research and also hinges on public trust that privacy
can be ensured. We will consider a set of new privacy threats that will arise as genetic
research advances, particularly as genotype–phenotype associations are better
understood and as applications of genetic genealogy become more prevalent."

Atrial fibrillation is the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, with prevalence estimated to be 5.2 million in
2010 and predicted to increase to 12.1 million in 2030. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for blood clots and
stroke, independently increasing stroke risk 4- to 5-fold throughout all ages. Therefore, the vast majority of
patients with atrial fibrillation require some form of stroke prevention therapy. Current first line stroke prevention
therapy for atrial fibrillation patients is life-long use of oral anti-coagulation medications, which are associated
with increase in bleeding risk by approximately 2- to 2.5-fold, including intracranial hemorrhage, that may lead
to hospitalization, transfusion, surgery, and death.
The purpose of the present study is to improve stroke prevention treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation by
transforming the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) procedure into a first line therapy for a larger segment
of patient populations, especially for younger patients with 20+ year of life expectancy who are likely to
experience bleeding problems in their lifetimes. LAAO is a minimally invasive procedure where an implant
delivered using an intravascular catheter is used to permanently seal off the left atrial appendage mechanically
to reduce the risk of blood clots. The barriers preventing LAAO from becoming a first line therapy are primarily
safety and cost. The investigators aim to overcome these barriers and transform LAAO into a first line therapy
by developing a real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided robotic intravascular catheter system for
performing LAAO procedures by synergistically combining novel medical imaging, robotic catheter control, and
advanced visualization technologies to improve the safety, cost, and workflow of LAAO procedures.
The proposed technology expands on novel approaches initiated by the investigators in earlier work in the areas
of real-time MRI image acquisition and reconstruction, robotic catheters actuated using the magnetic field of the
MRI scanner, advanced visualization, and volumetric planning of LAAO. The project is organized into three
Specific Aims, each focusing on one key aspect of the procedure workflow, namely, procedure planning,
transseptal puncture, and LAAO implant delivery. These Specific Aims build on crosscutting technical research
on MRI, robotics, and human-machine interface technologies, where the investigators will develop novel
technologies for rapid and flexible 2D/3D cardiac MRI imaging, robotically controlled MRI-compatible dexterous
cardiac catheters, and human-machine interfaces with advanced visualization.
The end result of this proposal will be the complete prototype of an MRI-guided robotic catheter system for
performing LAAO procedures combining real-time intraoperative MRI, robotic catheter control, and advanced
visualization technologies to facilitate safer, more efficient, and cost-effective LAAO procedures. The developed
system and the underlying technologies will be validated by experts in interventional cardiology in vertebrate
animal and non-clinical human studies."
10895302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue stem cell lineages maintain organ function and respond to dietary and physiological factors, and they
also experience intrinsic metabolic shifts as cells differentiate Metabolic/physiological alterations are also
linked to a number of diseases, including obesity and cancer. The mechanisms associated with intrinsic
metabolic shifts in stem cell lineages and how physiological factors affect them remain largely underexplored.
The Drosophila melanogaster ovary is ideal for the study of metabolic changes and their systemic control.
Oogenesis is an energy/nutrient-intensive process that precisely links oocyte development through the
germline stem cell (GSC) lineage with accumulation of lipids, carbohydrates, and other macromolecules.
Developmentally-controlled metabolic changes occur along differentiation of the GSC lineage. Over the past
~18 years, our work has shed light on a multi-organ network that tightly coordinates oogenesis with whole-
body physiology. GSCs and their progeny grow and divide faster on nutrient-rich rather than poor diets, and
brain insulin-like peptides, Target of Rapamycin, AMP-dependent kinase, the steroid hormone ecdysone, and
other factors mediate this response. Other organs also support the nutritional demands of oogenesis. For
example, adipocyte lipophorin-mediated transport of lipids is crucial for oocyte yolk uptake, and several other
adipocyte metabolic pathways have specific effects in oogenesis. The coordination of hormones, nutrients,
metabolism, and highly regulated transitions in the GSC lineage thus integrates information from the diet and
other organs. It remains unclear, however, how diet-dependent pathways affect cellular metabolism as cells
differentiate along stem cell lineages, and how metabolic disorders (e.g. obesity) alter this complex process.
Cellular metabolism is closely tied to nutrient fuel availability and utilization. Major cellular fuels include sugars,
fatty acids, amino acids, and ketone bodies, and their availability varies depending on the overall physiological
and metabolic state of the organism. Over the next 5 years, we will focus on two major questions in the
Drosophila model: 1) How does fuel preference shift as GSC daughters develop through various stages of
differentiation and in response to diet-dependent physiological input? 2) How does obesity impact the
development of the GSC lineage, its fuel preference, and response to physiological signals? These projects
will provide fundamental new knowledge to significantly advance our understanding of the integration between
metabolism and physiology in the control of stem cell lineages in vivo, with the potential to inform future
research additional stem cell systems and how their metabolic deregulation is tied to diseased states."
10896321,"The University of California Riverside (UCR) and Riverside City College (RCC) propose to create a
Bridges to the Baccalaureate (B2B) research education program to facilitate transfer of
community college students into university biomedical and behavioral science majors, with the
ultimate goal of increasing participation of underrepresented in medicine and science (URiMS)
groups in research-oriented careers in these areas. Many URiMS students have less access to
high quality science instruction, resources and enriching opportunities at all stages of public
education. African-Americans, Chicano/Latinos, Native Americans, Hawaiian and Alaskan
Natives, Pacific Islanders or socio-economically disadvantaged students make up a small
percentage of science teachers in K-12 as well as higher education, and are even more
underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral science fields requiring post-graduate degrees.
The proposed B2B program will identify community college students at RCC committed to
pursuing a career in science and facilitate their transfer and successful completion of
Baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors. The
program contains interventions and support services designed to help B2B scholars achieve
graduation in a normative two-year window following matriculation at UCR and to address the
causes of URiMS attrition in STEM programs. Specific program components include:
compensated research experiences to stimulate greater awareness of career options in the
biomedical and behavioral sciences and to reduce the necessity of working in non-academic jobs;
peer and faculty mentoring that begins before RCC/B2B scholars transfer to UCR; and a summer
boot camp to familiarize incoming students with UCR’s course structure and student support
services. By creating a program that bridges the community college and university education and
provides enhanced preparation before and mentoring after transfer, we believe we can
overcome these disadvantages and improve the success and persistence of URiMS transfer
students in biomedical and behavioral sciences."
10896322,"CXCR3-mediated Cell-Cell Communication in Glaucoma
SUMMARY
Glaucoma, which is characterized as progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and optic nerve
degeneration, is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Increased intraocular pressure
(IOP) is a main risk factor for glaucoma and is the only target for therapeutic intervention. However, lowering
IOP does not always stop the disease progression. There is an unmet need to understand the mechanisms of
neurodegeneration in glaucoma and identify novel targets for glaucoma therapy. Cell-cell communication plays
a key role in pathophysiological changes in multicellular organisms. Chemokines are a family of structurally
related pro-inflammatory peptides that plays a central role in the communication between injured/infected cells
and other cell types via binding to specific chemokine receptors on the membrane of their respective target
cells. While it has been well appreciated that chemokines are critically involved in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious, oncologic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the role of
retina-derived chemokines in glaucomatous optic neuropathy is largely unknown. CXCL10 is a chemokine and
its receptor is CXCR3. This pathway has a key role in inflammation by recruiting and activating several types of
leukocytes including macrophage/microglia and T cells. In this project, we hypothesize that the
CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway has an essential role in the communication between RGCs and other cell types
(immune cells and astrocytes) during glaucoma and blocking this pathway alleviates dysfunction/degeneration
of RGCs and their axons. We propose the following three aims: (Aim1) Test the hypothesis that CXCR3
signaling plays a key role in the communication between RGCs and immune cells, which contributes to
glaucomatous optic neuropathy; (Aim2) Test the hypothesis that CXCR3 induces toxic RGC-astrocyte
crosstalk via CXCR3-mediated C3/C3aR signaling; (Aim3) Test the hypothesis that blocking CXCR3 is an
effective approach to treat glaucoma. We will integrate a series of novel methodologies in the studies, such as
bone marrow chimeric mice, CXCR3 conditional knockout mice, AAV2-mediated gene therapy, real-time
imaging of leukocyte trafficking, tissue optical clearing, and clinic-relevant non-invasive imaging and functional
tests. Taken together, our proposed study will provide important new knowledge on CXCL10/CXCR3-mediated
cell-cell communication in neurodegeneration and may identify the novel therapeutic approaches to manage
glaucomatous optic neuropathy. This proposal is in line with “Research Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities”
identified in the NEI Strategic Plan: 1) The role of non-neuronal cells such as glia is critical for understanding
degenerative diseases; 2) Investigate neurobiology roles for immune factors that challenge orthodoxy and
examine whether these “immune” factors are playing nontraditional roles for vision function; 3) Identify targeted
therapeutics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for immune-related diseases."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a state of impaired bone quality and strength. Renal
osteodystrophy (ROD), a global disorder of bone strength, is present in the vast majority of CKD
patients. Fracture rates are 2- to 14-fold greater in patients with than without CKD and increase
in parallel with CKD severity. CKD in children significantly impairs bone architecture and
strength at a time that is critical for developing healthy bones. Fracture rates are 2-3 times
higher in children with CKD than the general population. The attendant morbidity and mortality
associated with fractures in CKD has led to efforts to better understand their pathogenesis in
order to develop and study treatments that improve bone strength while simultaneously
providing an acceptable safety profile across the life-course. The lack of safe and proven anti-
fracture pharmacologic strategies in children and adults with CKD represents a fundamental
therapeutic gap in CKD management.
We propose a pilot, 6-month, randomized clinical trial in 15 children and 88 adults with CKD
stages 2 and 3 to test potassium citrate supplementation vs. placebo effects on bone strength
as measured by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). We
will also examine urinary net acid excretion and measures of bone turnover to understand how
potassium citrate effects skeletal health.
These aims will be achieved through the collaborative efforts of three institutions: Montefiore
Medical Center/ Children’s Hospital at Montefiore, Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia
University Irving Medical Center. The research team has the necessary expertise and resources
to carry out this clinical trial. This study is innovative, as potassium citrate has never been tested
in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in chronic kidney disease in children and adults. Bone
disease in pediatric kidney disease is understudied and this study will be an important first step
to evaluating potassium citrate as a therapeutic agent. This pilot study will provide important
information for design of a future larger U01 trial to evaluate effects of potassium citrate on bone
outcomes across the life-course."

The United States faces a crisis due to the high prevalence of chronic pain and associated opioid use disorder
and overdose deaths. This crisis highlights the need for advanced and cross-disciplinary pain science training in
our emerging basic and clinical scientists. Thus, the goal of our training program is to enable a new generation
of young investigators with the expertise necessary to make substantial impact on pain science and treatment.
This application seeks renewal of funding for an Interdisciplinary Training Program in Pain Research at the
University of Iowa, requesting support for two predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees for this award period.
The program has been highly successful during its 15 years of funding, providing training to pre- and postdoctoral
fellows of exemplary quality that have gone on to develop strong independent research careers in pain research
and are actively involved in pain societies world-wide. The program will continue to provide basic training in the
cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie acute and chronic pain, as well as translational and clinical pain
research. The 23 faculty of our multidisciplinary training program is a balanced representation of basic scientists,
translational and clinical scientists from 12 departments and programs across 4 colleges at the University of
Iowa. Our clinical trainers include faculty with expertise in medicine, physical therapy, and nursing, with strong
emphasis on non-pharmacological approaches to pain management. Our more senior trainers with strong record
of training both predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows will also be responsible for mentoring junior trainers. The
training program provides a highly structured and diverse program of didactic coursework, including monthly
seminars, weekly journal clubs and work-in-progress meetings, that is coupled with research training in a highly
collaborative and interactive environment. In the next funding period, we propose to add several new features to
the program that are aimed at strengthening training in rigor and reproducibility, at enhancing quantitative literacy
and competence in biostatistics, and at expanding experience-based learning in basic, translational and clinical
pain research. The specific goals of the proposed training program are to: (1) assist trainees in developing an
individualized curriculum that provides a solid knowledge base in pain science appropriate to their career goals;
(2) provide formal instruction in rigor and reproducibility in biomedical pain research, including working
knowledge in biostatistics and quantitative approaches; (3) provide rigorous training in the elements of scientific
investigation including the formulation of research hypotheses, experimental design and analysis; (4) assist
trainees in developing their written and verbal scientific communication skills; (5) enable trainees to interact and
collaborate with basic and clinical pain researchers both within and outside the institution. It is expected that the
trainees in this program will acquire the knowledge, experience, and skill sets necessary for successful transition
to an independent research career in academia, industry or government."

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes struggle more than any other age group to meet recommended glycemic
targets. Continuous glucose monitoring devices, which enable real-time determination and communication of
blood glucose levels, identification of trends, alerts, and alarms, and remote communication and monitoring,
have improved metabolic and lifestyle outcomes and have markedly transformed the clinical management of
diabetes in youth. However, these technological improvements have not benefited all populations similarly: lower
rates of uptake and continued use of these devices in Black and Latinx young people have exacerbated pre-
existing racial disparities in diabetes care and outcomes. Beyond socioeconomic issues such as access,
developmentally and culturally specific factors relating to burden, diabetes distress, and self-efficacy are
modifiable targets for specific and innovative interventions. Structured peer mentoring programs have been
successfully employed in other chronic illness models to improve attitudes and behaviors around disease
management. Using a stakeholder engagement approach, we will develop, optimize, and evaluate a peer-
support intervention, Glu-COACH, to improve the uptake and maintenance of CGM use in Black and Latinx
adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The input from a stakeholder panel representing patients, parents, and
clinicians will inform each phase of the study. In Phase 1, we will collaboratively develop Glu-COACH and finalize
study protocols with our stakeholders. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled pilot study (n=50)
comparing Glu-COACH to an enhanced standard care control group, convening quarterly research progress
meetings with our stakeholders for ongoing collaboration. We hypothesize that the support, validation,
identification, vicarious experience, and role modeling provided by trained peer mentors of the same cultural
identity will significantly improve our primary aim of CGM use in Glu-COACH participants compared to the control
group. We will also examine the effects of the Glu-COACH intervention on glycemic outcomes, such as time in
range, mean glucose, and A1c, and behavioral outcomes, such as diabetes-related self-efficacy and distress,
as well as benefits and burdens related to CGM use. Finally, we will critically examine the feasibility, acceptability,
and implementation of the Glu-COACH intervention. This intervention will be upscaled and evaluated in a
subsequent multi-site randomized controlled trial if proven effective."
10892394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) gene. CF airways are immunocompromised and become colonized with bacteria soon after birth.
Chronic bacterial infection leads to persistent and severe neutrophil-dominated pulmonary inflammation, high
lung protease levels, lung damage and a decline in FEV1. CFTR modulator/correctors from Vertex such as
TRIKAFTA significantly increase CF patient lung function by >10% but do not bring it into the normal range and
for patients with pre-existing bacterial lung infections, do not clear bacteria from their lungs. Moreover, these
compounds do not treat CF patients with nonsense mutations where no CFTR protein is produced. Orai1 is a
ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane Ca2+ channel that is upstream and regulates neutrophilic
inflammation. Our preliminary data indicate (i) that Orai1 levels remain elevated in CF patient neutrophils
regardless of Trikafta treatment and (ii) that Orai1 levels inversely correlate with CF patient FEV1. Thus, there
is a critical unmet need for novel, CFTR mutation-agnostic therapies to reduce neutrophilic inflammation and
prevent further CF lung damage. Given Orai1’s proximal role in the immune response, Orai1 is thus an attractive
target whose inhibition is predicted to help resolve CF inflammation. We have developed a robust, novel
peptidomimetic called ELD607, which potently inhibits Orai1, and is stable in proteolytically-rich CF sputum. In
murine lung infection models with common CF pathogens including P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, a single,
inhaled dose of ELD607 reduced lung inflammation by 90% and increased survival by ~50%. In a chronic CF
model (SCNN1B mice), ELD607 reduced neutrophilia and increased survival. These experiments demonstrate
that rebalancing the lung’s inflammatory response by inhibiting Orai1 may be beneficial for the treatment of CF.
However, ELD607 is limited by solubility. In this Catalyst application, for Phase 1, we will optimize ELD607
structure and/or formulation to increase its solubility. For Phase 2, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose
and pharmacokinetics of the fully optimized ELD607, determine ELD607’s specificity for Orai1 vs other Ca2+
channels and test the hypothesis that ELD607 is an allosteric Orai1 modulator that causes Orai1 degradation,
rather than acting as a traditional channel pore blocker. We anticipate that these data will help differentiate
ELD607 from existing pore-blocking Ca2+ channel antagonists and help make it ready for advancement into
clinical trials."

Vaccination has had a profound impact on human health and has eradicated or almost eradicated once feared
diseases such as smallpox and polio and substantially decreased morbidity and mortality due to pneumococcus,
measles and pertussis amongst many others. The utility and cost effectiveness of vaccination has been shown
multiple times and most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has had a devastating effect on
humankind causing significant morbidity and mortality as well as major disruptions to the economy, education,
the supply chain and mental health. However, the extremely rapid development and deployment of multiple
COVID-19 vaccines has allowed society to return to a semblance of normality. These vaccines were developed
because of the large amount of money invested by governments to de-risk development and the many dedicated
vaccinologists (laboratory personnel, clinical trialists, nurses, regulatory affairs specialists, statisticians etc. in
academia, government and industry) who were committed to working on a common goal. Additionally, novel
vaccine platforms had been in development for many years so the knowledge about how these platforms could
be harnessed for COVID-19 was already present. In order to be ready for the next pandemic, we need to ensure
that there are sufficient individuals entering and staying in the field of vaccinology so that they can develop new
platforms, evaluate and dissect immune responses, perform clinical trials and have a broad understanding of the
entire vaccine development process. The overarching goal of the Integrated Training Program in Vaccinology
(ITP-Vax) is to encourage more trainees to join the field of vaccinology, particularly under-represented minorities
(URM), and to enable our existing outstanding early-career vaccinologists to excel in mentorship and to become
fully independent. To achieve this goal, we propose the following aims: Aim 1) To provide training in mentorship
to early-career investigators and assist them on their path to independence in vaccinology, and Aim 2) To provide
comprehensive training in vaccinology to post-baccalaureate or Master’s level students who are intending to
apply for a PhD or medical school in the next 1-2 years and who seek a career in vaccinology. We will also
actively engage and recruit URM’s for ITP-Vax so that we can ultimately improve diversity in vaccinology."

 Human LINE-1 (L1) elements are autonomous retrotransposons that continue to produce new
“offspring” L1 insertions in human genomes. Until recently, L1 elements were thought to be mobilized primarily
in the germline and then silenced in somatic cells throughout adulthood. However, several recent reports have
shown that L1 elements are active in at least some adult somatic tissues, including the brain and epithelial
somatic tumors. These observations have led to the suggestion that L1 might play a role in initiating human
cancers by mutating specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in somatic cells. In the three aims of this
proposal, we will further explore this hypothesis with an emphasis on studying the expression, regulation, and
mobilization of the full-length L1 source elements that generate new L1 insertions. In Specific Aim 1, we will
generate a comprehensive resource of full-length, human-specific L1 (FL-L1Hs) source elements that will be
used throughout this proposal (Aims 1-3) to study the role of L1 mobilization in human tissues and tumors. In
Specific Aim 2, we will examine the expression and regulation of FL-L1Hs elements that can evade somatic
repression and will study the mechanism(s) whereby these elements manage to do this. Finally, in Specific
Aim 3, we will examine the mobilization capacities of FL-L1Hs elements. Combined with the data generated in
Aims 1 and 2, these data will allow us to better understand the expression, regulation, and mobilization of the
FL-L1Hs elements that mutagenize the human genome. The successful completion of the three Aims of this
study will transform our understanding of how mobile elements impact human diseases, including cancers."

Despite substantial progress in prevention and treatment, dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay
or cavities, remains one of the most common and costly infectious diseases worldwide. According to the
CDC, associated health care costs USA tens of billions of dollars annually. Novel, comprehensive
strategies are needed to effectively combat caries pathogenesis. Cariogenic bacteria form tenacious
biofilms on the surface of teeth known as dental plaque. Supported by R01 DE019452, we have over the
past six years generated seminal evidence that biofilm regulatory protein BrpA, a multi-functional surface-
associated protein, plays a critical role in regulation of Streptococcus mutans cell envelope biogenesis and
biofilm formation and its ability to cause carious lesions. The overall goals of this competitive renewal are to
uncover the complexity of the molecular mechanisms that govern the expression of brpA and the
mechanisms how BrpA mediates intra- and inter-species biofilm formation, and to explore the potential of
the lead small molecules in targeting BrpA and modulation of S. mutans virulence. We will use an
integrative approach including various modern molecular, biochemical and bioinformatics techniques to
identify the transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors that govern the regulation of brpA expression,
and to determine the different binding epitopes and build the ligand-protein complex model to guide
structural and functional analysis of BrpA. In addition, we will use organic chemistry along with various
function assays and in vivo rat caries model to optimize the efficacy and selectivity of the selected lead
small inhibitory molecules against S. mutans and to explore their potential in novel anticaries strategy.
Successful implementation of this proposal could prove to be major advances in our understanding of BrpA
in S. mutans pathophysiology, which could ultimately be applied to the LCP proteins in other Gram-positive
bacteria. The findings on small molecules are expected to provide a solid foundation for the development of
novel strategies against S. mutans and human dental caries."
10893999,"Project Summary / Abstract
Perceptual systems operate in context: perception of a given object/event is influenced by the objects/events
that surround it. Speech perception operates in the same way, where perception of speech sounds is heavily
influenced by the acoustic properties of contextual sounds that surround them. These acoustic context effects
are critically important to perception because they help maintain perceptual constancy in the face of
considerable variability in speech acoustics and listening environments. Despite this importance, there is a
poor understanding of how acoustic context shapes speech perception. The well-established ways of
measuring speech perception routinely present stimuli without any context, or when they do, it is to study a
single context effect in quiet for listeners with normal hearing (NH). These approaches severely impede
understanding of speech perception in everyday listening conditions (in context, amidst background noise) and
for listeners with hearing difficulties. The long-term goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying these acoustic context effects in speech perception in normal and impaired auditory
systems. This goal is addressed through three specific aims. The first aim is to define the unifying relationships
between different context effects in speech perception by NH and hearing-impaired (HI) populations.
Experiments in the first aim utilize an individual differences approach to explore auditory context effects as a
unified system rather than individual isolated effects. The second aim is to study the impact of background
noise on these context effects for NH and HI populations. Experiments in the second aim will test competing
predictions regarding whether noise diminishes the influence of context via masking or enhances the influence
of context via streaming. The third aim is to investigate context effects in speech perception by cochlear
implant (CI) users. Experiments in the third aim with real- and simulated-CI listening will elucidate mechanisms
underlying context effects and the impacts of different aspects of CI processing. These aims are supplemented
by computational modeling of neural responses to the speech stimuli in order to clarify peripheral versus
central mechanisms underlying these context effects. Overall, the results will provide new insights into how
NH, HI, and CI populations perceive sounds in the context of other sounds and in background noise. These
efforts will produce better understanding of auditory perception with the realistic and prominent constraint of
contextual influence, and will help to provide a neural and behavioral framework for translational applications."

Project summary/abstract
In this project, we will investigate the actions of specific male seminal fluid molecules in
promoting fertility and fitness of the major disease vector of dengue, Zika yellow fever
and chikungunya viruses, Aedes aegypti. We will also define and analyze Aedes male
and female molecules that associate with and support sperm. Despite the crippling
impact of arbovirus infections, conventional mosquito control using insecticides can be
operationally difficult and is often ineffective. Strategies to replace or reduce populations
through modified male-releases show promise, but their success requires a deep
understanding of mosquito reproductive biology. Ae. aegypti males transfer molecules
in their seminal fluid to females during mating that induce female behavioral and
physiological changes, including stimulation of egg development and oviposition,
increased survival, and reluctance to re-mate with subsequent males. Despite the
potential of these molecules as vector-control targets, the molecular identity and actions
of these molecules are as yet unknown. During the current funding period, we utilized
the latest tools to gain novel insights into key aspects of male mating success, sperm
biology and female reproductive fitness, including identifying a limited subset of seminal
fluid proteins (Sfps) that induce post-mating changes in females, and small-molecules
such as juvenile hormone (JHIII) in seminal fluid. We propose two specific aims to (1)
identify the role of individual male seminal molecules on female remating, fecundity,
fertility, oviposition, lifetime reproductive success and survival and (2) to evaluate the
role of male- and female-derived molecules on sperm storage, function, and survival.
Our long-term goal is to design and deploy vector control strategies that target these
key components of mosquito life history to reduce the tremendous global burden of
mosquito-borne diseases."

High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in
chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of
reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few
confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need
for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far
more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target
or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries
with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will
navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified
compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target
specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery
across NIH Institutes.
The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible
to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques
can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening
for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general
initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3)
create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug
discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline
models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the
current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the
efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new
compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been
inaccessible."
10894058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The brain must maintain immunological homeostasis to prevent dysregulation and disease. Coordination of
immunity in most tissues involves the drainage of antigens or antigen-presenting cells within conventional
lymphatic vessels to the draining lymph nodes. In the lymph node, antigen presented to T cells, typically by
dendritic cells (DCs), can initiate an immune response. Control of immune response is unique in the central
nervous system as the brain parenchyma lacks conventional infiltrating lymphatic vessels and instead utilizes a
combination of intra-tissue glial-dependent clearance pathways and meningeal lymphatics surrounding the brain
to drain waste, antigens, fluid, and cells. Recently there has been mounting evidence implicating meningeal
lymphatic vessels as passive conductors of drainage in the progression, and resolution of various
neuropathologies. We previously discovered that neuroinflammation induces lymphangiogenesis of the
meningeal lymphatic vessels at the cribriform plate (cp) (Hsu et al. Nat Comm. 2019). We found that in situ
meningeal lymphangiogenesis was driven by VEGF-C producing DCs, and this is unique to the cp, highlighting
potentially different roles for dural lymphatics in neuroinflammation depending on their precise location. Here we
show single-cell RNA sequencing data revealing that neuroinflammation induces cribriform plate lymphatic
endothelial cell (cpLECs) gene expression related to antigen presentation, leukocyte adhesion, and
immunoregulation. This indicates that cpLECs are not just passive conductors of drainage, but active
contributors to the formation of a neuroimmune regulatory niche. We hypothesize that during neuroinflammation,
the cribriform lymphatics represent an immunoregulatory niche in which migratory DCs drained from the brain
are retained and communicate with cpLECs to regulate downstream immune response and homeostasis of the
central nervous system. The pathways of DCs traffic through the brain to the cribriform lymphatics, the
mechanism of their interaction with cpLECs, and the functional consequence of these interactions on both cell
types and on the formation of a neuroimmune niche are not known.
The long-term objective of this project is to define the pathways and dynamics of interactions between dendritic
cells and the cribriform plate lymphatics to understand the regulation of brain homeostasis and disease. The
specific objectives of this proposal are to map the timeline, origin, and mechanism of dendritic cell - cribriform
lymphatic endothelial cells interaction (DC-cpLEC) in the meningeal lymphatic vessels at the cribriform plate
(Aim 1); to define expressional consequences of the interaction between DCs and cpLECs (Aim 2), and to
examine the impact of DC-cpLEC interactions on lymphatic functionality and immunity (Aim 3).
Pharmacological manipulation of the cross-talk between dendritic cells and cribriform lymphatic endothelial cells
in CNS diseases may have potential therapeutic value for diseases related to CNS autoimmunity and
homeostasis."
10894059,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an immunotherapy that is revolutionizing cancer treatment, but is
effective in a minority of patients. Across many solid tumor types, this can largely be ascribed to an insufficient
number, diversity, and/or function of endogenously generated, pre-existing T cells that recognize tumor
neoantigens and infiltrate tumors. Therefore, there is a critical need for new strategies to bolster the
magnitude, breadth, and quality of neoantigen-specific T cells, to recruit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to tumors, and
to amplify their expansion, effector function, and persistence. Towards this goal, we propose a new strategy for
neoantigen-targeted cancer immunotherapy. Our approach leverages a STING-activating nanoparticle vaccine
(STAN-V) that we have designed to overcome several critical immunopharmacological barriers that limit cancer
vaccine efficacy. The STAN-V platform is based on polymer nanoparticles engineered to enhance intracellular
co-delivery of peptide neoantigen and agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a design that we
have demonstrated stimulates potent neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells and increases response to ICB. Our
objective in this R01 application is to advance and mature STAN-V as a universal platform for neoantigen-
targeted cancer vaccines. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims. First, we will develop
and optimize a facile strategy for rapid fabrication of STAN-Vs based on spontaneous and efficient loading of
neoantigenic peptides designed with optimized lipophilic domains. We will evaluate the capacity of this
approach to increase the magnitude and breadth of neoantigen-specific T cell responses to physicochemically
diverse neoantigens. As such, we expect these studies to advance the translational-readiness of STAN-Vs as
a personalized vaccine technology. Second, we will leverage the unique morphology and properties of STAN-
Vs to develop and optimize a novel adjuvant combination based on coordinated co-packaging and co-delivery
of STING and TLR agonists. We will systematically explore the effect of combinatorial adjuvant delivery on
innate and adaptive immunity, studies that we expect will yield an optimized adjuvant combination for
stimulating antitumor cellular immunity. Third, we will devise and test a new approach for enhancing tumor
homing and infiltration of T cells elicited via vaccination. This strategy will leverage systemic administration of a
nanoparticle STING agonist that reshapes the tumor milieu to enhance T cell infiltration, proliferation, and
function. Overall, these studies will advance STAN-Vs as an enabling and versatile technology for stimulating
robust neoantigen-specific T cell responses and improving outcomes of immunotherapy across many cancers."
10864414,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 100,000 Americans, primarily of African descent, live with sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic red
blood cell (RBC) disorder characterized by a mutated hemoglobin (HbS). HbS-containing RBCs sickle when
exposed to low oxygen or hypertonic environments, precipitating acute, excruciatingly painful episodes of
vascular obstruction. Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) account for a 7 to 30-fold higher hospitalization rate and
a 2- to 6-fold higher rate of emergency department visits, compared to age-specific rates for Black Americans
without SCD, and adversely impact quality of life and survival. Current disease-modifying treatments for SCD
such as hydroxyurea, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab only reduce hospitalizations for VOE by 50% at most. Thus,
prevention of VOE by other means in combination with existing treatments remains crucial. Chronic dehydration
is a quantifiable and potentially actionable biomarker, which may predict morbidity and mortality in patients with
SCD. In emergency room settings, VOE is frequently accompanied by acute dehydration, which is managed by
fluid replacement. However, the prevalence of chronic dehydration during “steady-state” conditions (i.e., non-
crisis) is unknown, and it is uncertain whether mild, chronic dehydration predicts increased risk of SCD-related
morbidity or mortality. Age-associated hyposthenuria (i.e., the inability to concentrate urine), is common in SCD,
and could plausibly contribute to chronic dehydration. Although SCD is thought to induce compensatory
polydipsia (i.e., increased thirst), conflicting reports also note impaired thirst regulation, which may be sex or age
dependent. Of note, all large examinations of steady-state dehydration have been limited to infants and very
young children, excluding adolescents or adults who may be more susceptible to chronic dehydration due to
progressive renal dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that chronic dehydration is predictive of VOE, hospitalizations,
and death, and of relevance, may be suitable for monitoring to prevent VOE. To analyze the relationship between
chronic dehydration and subsequent VOE we will 1). Conduct an epidemiologic investigation, using data and
specimens available from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and the more contemporary
Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH), and 2). Conduct a prospective, clinical study enrolling 50 participants
with SCD. The CSSCD and MSH are open BioLINCC studies with rich phenotyping, lengthy prospective follow
up, and adjudicated clinical events. We will use available serum specimens from these cohorts to assay serum
osmolality, a marker of dehydration. Our observations from the epidemiologic investigation will be complemented
by the prospective clinical study, which will include more granular data collection and state-of-the-art
measurements of dehydration. The knowledge to be gained from this project will establish whether chronic
dehydration during steady-state conditions is predictive of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD and has
the potential to influence patient behavior and recommendations for care, such as at-home hydration monitoring
to encourage fluid intake for VOE prevention."
10864281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Agriculture is one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, including a disproportion risk of
death from heat-related illnesses (HRIs). Proper hydration mitigates HRI, yet farmworkers report limited access
to drinking water while working. The years 2016 and 2020 tied for the world’s hottest on record, and the rates
of the rates of HRI and death are on the rise. The overall purpose of this proposal is to learn how to
successfully design and implement a hydration intervention among Latino farmworkers. The specific aims of
this proposed mixed methods study are 1) using Michie’s Capabilities-Opportunities-Motivations (COM-B)
model, determine the individual, organizational, and system-based facilitators and barriers to the successful
adoption of backpack hydration systems among farmworkers, and 2) evaluate feasibility and preliminary
efficacy of backpack hydration systems on fluid intake, hydration status, and HRI self-reported symptoms of a
farmworker cohort. For Phase 1 and Phase 2, farmworker participants will be provided with a backpack
hydration system to be used for water intake while working. During Phase 1 focus group discussions will be
conducted with up to 60 farmworkers and 12 stakeholders. Phase 2 will provide feasibility and efficacy data
among 50 farmworkers. Hydration status will be measured using pre- and post-shift urine specific gravity
readings and HRI symptoms will be measured using a validated survey. Urine specimens and surveys will be
collected at three timepoints over a March-to-September growing season. This NIOSH Mentored Research
Scientist Development Award (K01) would support the Principal Investigator to meet the following career
development goals; 1) develop expertise in design, application, and evaluation of preventative workplace
interventions through implementation science, and 2) advance expertise in conducting community-based
participatory research (CBPR) to reduce the inequitable health risks among Latino outdoor workers. These
goals would be achieved through knowledge and skill obtainment in conducting implementation science and
CBPR, occupational culture and policy, and leadership and dissemination by leveraging senior mentorship, an
agromedicine institute, and an established community-university partnership, and local and national resources.
This work will set the foundation for a larger, in-depth study aimed at testing and evaluating interventions to
decrease HRI symptoms and dehydration among workers, contributing to fewer HRIs. Future studies will
continue to utilize implementation science and CBPR to develop innovative methodologies to promote safe and
healthy workplaces for workers."

The epidermis provides skin barrier function against the harsh external environment and is the primary site of
vitamin D production. Deficiencies in epidermal keratinocyte function lead to increased risks for skin infection
and inflammation. The expression of genes encoded within the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC)
locus is critical for epidermal function that must adapt to different environments to further ensure survival. We
discovered recent evolution in the human epidermis. We report a recent selective sweep for increased
involucrin (IVL) expression in the epidermis of individuals from European populations in contrast to African
populations. Our finding reveals functional diversity and adaptation in the human epidermis associated with
human migration out of Africa. Yet the mechanisms for involucrin dosage and the functional impact for
adaptive epidermal function are not known. Here we aim to rigorously understand the mechanisms by which
IVL modulates Vitamin D receptor (VDR) function in the epidermis, an emerging paradigm based on our in
vivo mouse and human population studies. Ivl knockout (Ivl-/-) mice express lower levels of vitamin D receptor
expression in the epidermis resulting in decreased ligand-bound vitamin D receptor signaling and dampened
Tslp-mediated inflammation. This newly discovered phenotype for Ivl-/- mice highlights a functional role for Ivl
to modulate Vdr signaling for epidermal immune crosstalk in contrast to previous work that found involucrin to
be dispensable for skin barrier development. This finding is significant as IVL and VDR are both increased in
the epidermis of individuals of European ancestry in contrast to relatively decreased IVL and VDR expression
in the epidermis of individuals of African ancestry. Together, our discoveries in mice and human reveal a
functional regulatory axis for IVL/VDR that underlies the evolutionary selection and diversity of the human
epidermis. We will test the following overarching hypothesis in this study. Involucrin modulates vitamin D
receptor function and epidermal crosstalk for adaptive epidermal function that underlies human skin diversity
and evolution. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims. Aim 1. Identify the regulatory
mechanisms for increased IVL. Aim 2. Identify the mechanisms for Involucrin-mediated regulation of vitamin
D receptor. Aim 3. Identify the involucrin pathway for adaptive epidermal immune crosstalk. Completion of the
aims will generate new knowledge for IVL/VDR axis function that underlies human skin diversity and
evolution. This knowledge will facilitate precision medicine initiatives designed for population-specific skin and
critical for achieving global skin health."
10877523,"1 Study of neurodevelopmental diseases necessitates primate models, and the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is
 2 an ideal species. However, there are limited number of marmoset pluripotent stem cell lines (cjPSCs), and almost
 3 no embryo-derived naïve cjPSC lines available to the marmoset research community. This application for an
 4 administrative supplement is submitted to meet the objectives of RFA-DA-21-006 and is submitted under that
5 funding mechanism. We are seeking supplemental funds for U01DA056556, “Tools for gene editing in
 6 marmosets,” to enable a collaboration with Dr. Ali Brivanlou’s laboratory at Rockefeller University (RU). Both the
 7 RU and Johns Hopkins (JHU) groups seek to create genetically modified marmoset models of neurodegenerative
 8 diseases. The objective of this collaboration is to derive new PSC cell lines from marmoset embryos through a
 9 synergistic collaboration that will benefit both research teams. We will make these lines widely available to the
10 research community. Rationale for this new collaboration: Johns Hopkins (JHU) has developed expertise in
11 IVF in the marmoset with an established marmoset colony that can produce marmoset embryos and Rockefeller
12 University (RU) has expertise in creation of pre-ICM marmoset PSCs called 8-cell stage-like cells (8CLCs) that
13 have a high likelihood of germline transmission. For Aim 1, we will generate new marmoset naïve cjPSCs
14 from IVF-derived 4 to 8-cell stage embryos. Dissociated embryos created at Hopkins will be used to develop
15 new marmoset PSC lines (cjPSCs) and embryo-derived naïve cjPSC lines. These PSC lines will be made
16 available to the research community and will facilitate gene editing in the species. Aim 2 will confirm growth
17 of naïve PSCs and 8CLCs in 8-cell stage embryos and transfer of chimeric embryos into marmoset
18 females. The team at RU have developed 6 transgenic cjPSCs and this aim seeks to convert these lines into
19 8CLCs that will be injected into isochronic 8-cell stage embryos generated by the Hopkins group. We expect that
20 these injections will create chimeras. Following injection, the embryos will be transferred into females to obtain
21 F0 generation with germline transgenesis. In Aim 2A for the pilot phase of this experiment, we will inject one
22 transgenic cjPSC the Rockefeller team has generated, HTT CAG87. We will also inject 3-5 eight cell embryos
23 with other PSCs and confirm expression of the reporter construct and embryo development to the blastocyst
24 stage. For Aim 2B we will transfer 10 embryos to recipient, experienced females that have been programmed
25 and are timed to receive the embryos. A total of 25 embryos are needed for completion of all experiments
26 in Aims 1 and 2. The tools and methods developed will allow this collaborative effort to rapidly generate and
27 characterize stem cell lines in the species. We will leverage highly specialized expertise from both groups to
28 synergistically achieve the establishment of new marmoset PSC lines and chimeric offspring with a likelihood of
29 germline transgenesis. Our collaborative team of experienced investigators is uniquely poised to complete the
30 proposed studies and have established well-defined milestones with benchmarks for success.

10878004,"Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) together define the continuum from toxicant exposure to
biological perturbations that can cause adverse outcomes. Toxicology increasingly involves computational
approaches that complement laboratory studies and provide a more integrated, quantitative and mechanistic
basis for human health risk assessment. The Computational Modeling Core (CMC) will provide a suite of
computational capabilities to support both the Biomedical and Environmental Engineering Projects. The CMC
will: (i) develop physiologically based PK (PBPK) and PD models of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, (ii)
provide Project-oriented bioinformatic support for high-dimensional omic studies, and (iii) provide cross-
disciplinary training in computational toxicology. Model development will be coordinated iteratively with laboratory
experiments carried out by the Projects. Prior CMC interactions with the Michigan State University (MSU)
Superfund Projects have shown that this iterative approach is efficient for hypothesis generation and evaluation.
In Specific Aim 1 (SA1) we will develop PBPK models for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodiben-p-dioxin (TCDD) and
Superfund site-relevant polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs). The models will include
induction of hepatic CYP1A2 as a dioxin-binding protein and liver lipid accumulation for more accurate
predictions of free PCDD/F concentrations. The models will support hepatotoxicity studies in mice in Project 3
and PCDD/F bioavailability studies of activated carbon-treated soil in Project 5. Human PBPK models will also
be developed to help establish tissue dose equivalency between mice and humans for Project 3 and for
extrapolation of in vivo PCDD/F exposure levels based on in vitro assays in Projects 1 and 2. In SA2 we will
use bioinformatic tools to parse out aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated cell state trajectories from single-
cell RNA sequencing data in human CD5+ B cells (Project 1) and mouse hepatocytes (Project 3), and apply
nonlinear dynamical systems analysis to identify novel biomarkers predictive of onset of AHR-mediated toxicity.
We will also identify AHR-perturbed gene regulatory networks to inform pathway modeling in SA3. In SA3,
dynamical pathway modeling for Project 1 will address the effects of AHR activation on the PD-1 inhibitory signal
transduction pathway in CD5+ B cells. For Project 2, a model of induction of hepatic thyroid hormone metabolism
by PCDD/Fs will be developed to support population health risk assessment. For Project 3, pathway modeling
will focus on disruption of hepatic lipid metabolism through AHR-mediated transcriptional alteration of key liver
enzymes. These models will support rigorous investigation of nonlinear dose-responses and provide a strong
foundation for research supporting mechanistically-driven risk assessment. CMC will also support Project 4 to
model the vitamin B12 salvaging and de novo synthesis pathways in bacteria dehalogenating PCDD/Fs. In SA4,
in collaboration with RETCC, a 3-day course on PBPK modeling and a 5-day course on Computational Systems
Toxicology: Modeling and Informatics will be offered in alternate years to SRP and risk assessment communities."

 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Mpox (MPX) a global health emergency in 2022 and in the
United States, MPX was declared a Public Health Emergency with >30,500 cases confirmed so far. MPX is a
zoonotic infectious disease caused by the orthopoxvirus Mpox virus (MPXV), which is related to the virus that
causes smallpox. Vaccination against smallpox offers protection against MPXV; however, routine smallpox
vaccination ended in 1972 in US and 1984 world-wide following the successful global eradication of smallpox in
1979. Hence, most of the world’s population is highly vulnerable. In March-June 2023, 40 Mpox cases were
identified in Chicago, including many vaccinated patients, suggesting decreased vaccine effectiveness.
 There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for MPX. There is an Expanded Access Investigational New Drug
(EA-IND) Protocol for use of tecovirimat (TPOXX), which targets VP37, a viral protein involved in the
envelopment of intracellular mature virus. Cidofovir (CDV) and its lipid pro-drug brincidofovir have been reported
to also inhibit multiple orthopoxviruses, albeit with reduced potency relative to their activity against herpesviruses.
There are several reports that establish that the barriers to resistance for TOPXX and CDV are low. Hence, there
is a lack of efficacious, well-tolerated drugs that can be broadly used for the treatment and prevention of MPXV
infections. To address this public health challenge our multidisciplinary team will extend long standing
collaborative efforts on other infectious diseases towards the discovery of innovative antivirals that target MPXV.
This strategy is designed to leverage exceptional expertise in drug discovery, nucleoside chemistry, assay
development, screening technologies, and mechanism of action studies, augmented by the expertise at the CDC.
 We hypothesize that direct antiviral agents (DAA) against MPXV can be efficiently discovered through
informative assays for high throughput screening (HTS) and high content screening (HCS) and validated, thus
leading into downstream lead candidate development. To address this hypothesis, we propose experiments that
address the following aims:
Specific Aim 1. To further develop and optimize antiviral assays
Specific Aim 2. To implement screening campaigns for the discovery of low cytotoxicity antiviral hits
Specific Aim 3. To determine the mechanisms of action and resistance (MOA and MOR) of select hits
Specific Aim 4. To optimize potent, broad-spectrum, non-cytotoxic hits and identify a clinical candidate
Given the team’s preliminary data, outstanding expertise, access to world-class state-of-the-art screening
facilities (including BSL-3 labs), and the contributions to development of drugs for the treatment of HIV, HBV,
HCV, and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, we expect to generate compound leads that can progress rapidly to
advanced preclinical development."
10882885,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of death worldwide. Although diagnosis and
treatment approaches have improved, the prognosis of heart failure (HF) patients remains poor. After
myocardial infarction (MI), there is a permanent loss of functional cardiomyocytes (CMs), and as the
mammalian heart has limited regenerative capacity, it leads to HF and death. Lower organisms like
zebrafish, newts, and even 1-day mice and pig can regenerate their heart post-injury by inducing CM
proliferation. Attempts have been made to transiently reconstitute embryonic signaling in adult hearts,
including overexpression of cell cycle activating and proliferative genes, with limited success. Existing gene
therapy approaches for the heart have significant challenges like short-term, low, or uncontrolled
expression and genome insertion, resulting in insufficient CM proliferation and cardiac repair. Recently we
have shown that modified mRNA (modRNA) delivery is a safe, efficient, transient, non-immunogenic, local,
and dose-controlled gene delivery platform for the heart. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived
extracellular vesicles (EV)/exosomes have been shown to improve cardiac function. However, the
mechanism of iPSC-EV mediated cardiac regeneration remains unclear. In our preliminary studies, using
a hiPSC-extracellular proteomic approach combined with a developmentally restricted gene database of
mouse hearts, we identified for the first time that Phosphoserine Aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) protein is
expressed exclusively in hiPSC-EVs, and PSAT1 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated quickly
after the postnatal period in mice hearts. Myocardial delivery of PSAT1 modRNA induced CM proliferation,
improves cardiac function and mice survival post-MI. Furthermore, we showed that YAP1 is a
transactivator of PSAT1 and induces its expression, and in turn, PSAT1 induces β-catenin nuclear
translocation to induce CM proliferation. We found a novel YAP1-PSAT1-β-catenin molecular signaling
axis in cardiac regeneration. Moreover, PSAT1 induced serine synthesis pathway (SSP), nucleotide
synthesis and inhibited oxidative stress and DNA damage response post-MI. This proposal will determine
a local and short pulse of cmsPSAT1 (CM-specific PSAT1) or PSAT1 modRNA is sufficient for the induction
of cardiac regeneration and reversal of cardiac remodeling post-MI and HF, respectively, and will study
the pleiotropic effects of PSAT1 through novel molecular mechanisms on activating YAP1-β-catenin
molecular axis and downstream signaling pathways. Finally, determine the involvement of SSP in PSAT1
induced CMs proliferation and cardiac regeneration post-MI. The highly translatable nature of our proposed
modRNA platform and our integrative, multi-disciplinary experimental plan are ultimately geared towards
clinical applicability for ischemic heart diseases."
10880874,"ABSTRACT
Most patients who form calcium-containing kidney stones are hypercalciuric (excess calcium in urine), compared
with non-stone formers. These patients are often in negative calcium (Ca) balance in that they excrete more Ca
in their urine than they absorb from their diet, indicating a net loss of total body Ca. The source of the excessive
urine Ca (uCa) is almost certainly the skeleton, the largest Ca repository in the body. Indeed these patients often
have a reduction in bone mineral density, clinical osteoporosis, decreased bone strength and an increase in the
rate of bone fracture. The primary endpoint for successful treatment of patients with Ca-containing kidney stones
is a decrease in stone recurrence rate. Equally important, and often not as well recognized, is maintaining and
improving the patient's bone mineral density (BMD) and bone quality. To study idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) in
ways that are impossible in man, we developed an animal model of this disorder. Through >100 generations of
successive inbreeding of the most hypercalciuric SD rat progeny, we established a strain of rats that now
consistently excrete ~8-10 times as much uCa as the founder SD rats. All of these rats spontaneously form
kidney stones, and are termed Genetic Hypercalciuric Stone-forming (GHS) rats. In common with patients with
IH, GHS rats have normal serum concentrations of Ca and 1,25D, increased intestinal Ca absorption, enhanced
bone resorption, decreased renal tubule Ca reabsorption, and hypomineralization of bone with weakened
mechanical properties. The overall goal of this proposed research project is to use the GHS rats to study the
relationship of hypercalciuria to BMD and bone quality. We propose to determine if increased expression of
vitamin D receptor (VDR) is responsible, at least in part, for the hypercalciuria and decreased BMD and bone
quality in the GHS rats. We will then determine if pharmacologic interventions to reduce hypercalciuria will
improve BMD and bone quality. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Test the hypothesis that the
decreased BMD and bone quality in the GHS rats, compared to the founder SD rats, is due to an increased
abundance of VDR in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, resulting in an alteration in function. 2. Test the
hypothesis that hypercalciuria, stone formation, reduced BMD and bone quality in the GHS rats can be improved
by pharmacologic treatments, including bisphosphonates, RANKL ligand inhibitor and sclerostin inhibitor,
directed toward reducing hypercalciuria. Results from these studies may lead to future clinical studies to reduce
hypercalciuria and recurrent stone formation and improve bone quality."
10881432,"Most of our behavior consists of learning about the environment, choosing between options that we learned
about, and storing the learning in memory for future use. These processes rely on a set of basic computations,
including estimations of value and uncertainty and calculations of prediction errors. Prior research has
identified neural correlates of these computations, and linked aberrations in these computations to maladaptive
behavior and psychopathology. This research, however, typically focused on one process (e.g. learning,
decision-making or memory), within one domain (e.g. rewards or punishments). Our goal in this application is to
characterize core computations of value, uncertainty and prediction error, across processes and domains, within
the individual, and to identify associations between these computations and symptoms of anxiety and stress-
related disorders. We plan to do this in a behavioral study with 1000 participants (Aim 1), and a functional MRI
study of 100 participants (Aim 2), including both men and women from the general population. We will employ a
well-validated decision-making paradigm, together with a novel naturalistic game-like experimental paradigm,
which combines a passive-learning stage, a decision-making stage, and a memory stage administered on a
second day. Our design will include explicit measures, and latent variables which will be derived from
computational modeling. In Aim 1, we will characterize the computations behaviorally, by constructing a
distribution for each measure, based on the whole sample, and characterizing each subject based on their
location in this distribution. This will allow us to estimate similarities and differences between computations of
the same measure (e.g. value) across processes (learning, decision-making and memory) and domains (rewards
and punishments). In Aim 2 we will characterize the computations neurally, by examining activation and
connectivity patterns. We will estimate to what extent these patterns for each measure (e.g. value) in one process
(e.g. learning) predict the patterns for the same measure in other processes (e.g. decision-making and memory)
and to what extent representations in the reward domain predict those in the punishment domain. Aim 3 will
classify participants based on the behavioral and neural characteristics, and identify associations between these
classifications and clinical symptoms of anxiety and stress-related disorders. We hypothesize that different
psychopathology symptoms are associated with the type and magnitude of alterations in basic computations.
Together, the proposed studies will inform our basic understanding of the computations of value, uncertainty and
prediction error, and will unravel links between these computations and clinical symptoms, in a dimensional
manner, consistent with the RDoC approach. In the long term, we expect the methodology developed as part of
the proposed studies to be useful in characterizing neurobehavioral differences in a variety of conditions beyond
anxiety and stress."
